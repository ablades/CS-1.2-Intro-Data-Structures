 My honor Mr. Salvatore. After all, someone had to do it.
 She's all alone. Does this mean I can finally have you all to myself?
 Knowing father, he will want to throw a Founders' Party every year.
 Because you are the rope in the Salvatore's brother's tug of war?
 I beg your pardon?
 This conversation is over.
 How do you know who I am?
 What do you want?
 I just spoke to Giuseppe Salvatore. The round up happens tonight.
 I will.
 Once the flames create chaos, crawl to the exit under the quire loft. I'll be there to set you free.
 Your carriage is just waiting.
 Now onto your part of the deal.
 We shall take each other's secrets to the grave. Now, you must hurry.
