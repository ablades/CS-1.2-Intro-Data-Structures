 Nora's right. How long are we to live on three sips a day? It's that prison world all over again.
 Beau's mute.
 You mean when you loved us and allowed us to have actual fun?
 Now you want us to coexist? We know. We heard your speech.
 Yeah. Who needs the rest of the world, right? We have each other.
 Remember that large squirrel you ran over this morning? Turns out, that was actually our friend, Valerie.
 
 You're worse than your friend  you thought about doing the right thing, but then you just left her there.
 It's fine, though it would look entirely better on you.
 
 Wait.
 
 
 
 Valerie! Beau!
 Help! He's dead!
 We found him in town. He was just lying there.
 
 No screaming, please!
 How do you know how to work that device?
 Mystic Falls is ours now. So is any human who steps foot inside it.
 Leaving so soon?
 Do you? Because it certainly doesn't look like it. What's that expression? "Finders keepers?"
 What Lorenzo should have done  vervain.
 
 So, been there, sister. Just be happy I didn't hang you by your feet like we do with the cows.
 We have a burial to go to. My girlfriend thinks her outfit has to be fashion-forward. I disagree. What do you think?
 Nora, show us!
 Help us, and perhaps I can find a small stool for you to stand on.
 I'm sure you're beautiful, my love.
 You wore that dress to Queen Victoria's funeral! It's stunning!
 
 I'm curious  what do you think of this color?
 Do you think it'll make your eyes pop?
 
 Why the hell are you in here?
 What did she say to you?
 Agh!
 
 Good thing I don't need to touch you to do this.
 
 
 He found me on the streets. He was kind to me, something I hadn't felt in years. He's the one who convinced me to meet with Lily.
 We're on a mission, Nora. Not a vacation.
 Damon? I know you're in here. Open up!
 Damon, open the 
 University housing. How lovely.
 
 
 
 
 We still have thirteen minutes.
 
 Did I say you could leave?
 I haven't been to a party since New Year's 1902. Be honest  will I make a proper modern devil?
 Would you prefer I chose a different one and dyed it with your blood?
 
 You're right. I don't. I've had to endure two lifetimes with that conniving shrew, and I've learned that when it comes to Val? You don't get on her bad side.
 
 Well?
 
 
 Stop it!
 
 It's fifteen minutes past the hour. Distraction period over.
 A Bijou for me, and a Cr√®me Yvette for my little flower here.
 Beg your pardon?
 Nora... Where did you go? I'm just tipsy enough to enjoy this music...
 
 This trashy girl wouldn't mean a damn thing to you if you weren't so desperate for attention!
 
 Very well. Do whatever you want. I'm going to finish what we came here to do.
 
 Oh. That's excellent news.
 
 Do not pity me!
 
 How old do you think I am?? I could think of nothing more futile than prattling on about one's emotions. As if I can prevent Nora from drifting away if I only find the right words...
 UNGH!
 
 I can't help it. You're adorable.
 No. I'm sorry. We've been on our own  scorned, abused, imprisoned  for so long, I've forgotten that this world is meant to be enjoyed, not feared.
 Help me remember.
 We've spent an entire lifetime there. The night is ours.
 
 
 Guess what, Oscar? Julian's coming back. Life's about to get fun again.
 Look who's in a heap of trouble!
 
 Lily, we found Valerie! She's over here trying to kill the love of your life.
 
 
 
 
 There you are! Guests are arriving. Help me greet them?
 What's wrong with it?
 What are we talking about?
 At least 'til the dessert course.
 Do you think? Nora didn't even notice.
 
 
 
 
 Don't tell me you forgot.
 
 Who are all these people?
 Are you ill? Lily would never allow this.
 Quiet! I need your opinion.
 Do you think she'll say yes?
 Why am I so nervous?
 
 It's perfect.
 Mostly. Julian and Beau helped.
 What's that?
 Marry me. 133 years is not enough, Nora. I want eternity.
 Heh! Really?
 
 
 
 Sorry. It's just this is a lot to take in.
 What is she doing?
 Lily, you're bleeding.
 What is this?
 How do I know that you were pregnant with Stefan's child?
 You lied to Lily about your affair with Stefan, just like you lied to us about killing Oscar, so why should I believe that you're telling the truth now?
 I have to get out of here.
 
 
 And you would side with a girl who murdered her own brother?
 No! What are you doing?
 Nora, please!
 Nora. Nora!
 Nora gave me back the ring...
 What is all this?
 What?
 No. No. Tell me this isn't real. Tell me this isn't happening!
 Julian's not here... if that's what you're worried about.
 None of your concern.
 Have you seen her?
 This is your fault, you know. This fracturing?
 
 Even if by some stretch of the imagination it's not, the timing is awfully suspect, isn't it?
 Well, you had over one hundred years to tell this story, and you only did once you were back in Stefan's life. 'Til it served you. Gained you sympathy.
 Am I?
 Can we talk?
 Well?
 Are you going to apologize?
 
 Is that what's bothering you?
 No, he's not! Julian is just as upset as any of us. Valerie's story is responsible.
 If I say he's a liar, can we go back home? I'm tired of fighting.
 You've been wanting this for a long time, haven't you? Almost like you've been planning it all along.
 Am I? It took you no time to enroll in classes, move into a dorm, make friends with our enemies...
 I've been following someone, but she certainly hasn't been acting like my girlfriend. I wanted to do something different with you, actually.
 
 I don't know.
 Probably when I started dating you.
 I've been here all day. You'd think that would earn me better service!
 
 
 ...Ababbas Dogoineh... Ababbas Dogoineh... Melunah... Washaset...
 Not for Rayna Cruz. Rayna has a taste for taunting her victims. Like a cat nibbling the legs off a spider.
 You got one, too.
 
 Let's get going, Nora. The sooner she's dead, the better.
 We're good, thanks.
 
 Since when do you eat disgusting garbage food?
 
 
 If we find her, we kill her.
 You'll probably just watch.
 Considering you're a murderous vampire-hunting bitch who chased us across Europe for decades... Yeah, we should look familiar. You sent one of these to all of us. Ring a bell?
 We should stop stalling and slit her throat?
 We don't know that for sure. Why should we risk it?
 Of course she is. Bonnie's right about everything. She's perfect.
 
 I just, uh... wanted to say thank you. For today.
 We still make a good team, don't you think?
 Do you like her?
 I'm sorry I chose Julian. If I could take it back, I would choose you. Every time. I love you, Nora. I hope you'll forgive me someday.
 
 You're going to be all right.
 Julian, you're bleeding.
 
 Look, you love Caroline and you don't want her to die. I understand, because that is the way I feel about Nora and she will  we all will  if you do not get out of our way!
 
 We'll get to Richmond. From there, we could fly as far from here as possible.
 I do. Maybe it'll kill me. Beau, Lily, Oscar, Malcolm... our family couldn't survive in this new world. And now, once again, the two of us have to worry about a psychotic huntress who will kill any vampire in her sight. Maybe this will be a quick, sodium-laden means to my end.
 We are running for our lives. What could I possibly have to be happy about?
 Am I supposed to know what that is?
 
 I suppose there's no one I'd rather explore this dreadful world with.
 Just... just feeling cold.
 You seem quite yourself.
 
 Made from Rayna's blood. It's poisonous to witches.
 
 "Come live with me and be my love / And we will all the pleasures prove / No valleys, groves, hills and fields / Woods or steepy mountain yields..."
 
 It's one of Nora's favorite poems. She used to read it to me daily.
 
 
 Awful. I've been poisoned.
 You are... a terrible liar.
 Nora, I'm dying. There is no antidote. Alex told me.
 You're driving? I've got even less time on earth than I thought...
 Nothing too decadent.
 I'm trying to maintain my charms.
 That was an amazing escape! I take back all my insults about your driving.
 
 
 
 One good thing with the strength I have left.
 
 I will not let her put you in this hell stone!
 I'm already dead, my love.
 Nora, don't! You must live!
 
 
 
 
 I love you.
