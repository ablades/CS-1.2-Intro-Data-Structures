 Excuse me, ladies. Party at Whitmore House tonight.
 
 Hey, I remember you.
 Jesse, technically, but 'Flyer Guy' works, too.
 Nice to meet you.
 You guys going in, or...?
 Hey, Blow-Off Girl. Aren't you a freshman? How are you in this class?
 Are you going to the bonfire tonight? Or are you just gonna get really close and then turn around and leave again?
 Sweet. We'll hang.
 I got that.
 Whoa...uh...
 Wow. Boyfriend drama, kicked out of class...today's not your day.
 "Dr. Dickfield"?
 Tell you what — help me grab some more firewood, and I will tell you everything you need to know.
 I had Dr. Maxfield for a few classes last year. He's a jerk, but he's brilliant, so I'll give him a pass.
 There's a rumor that he's...a part of this secret society on campus.
 I have no idea. All I know is that a few times a week, they supposedly meet at Whitmore House. But you didn't hear that from me.
 And a serious right-hook. But hey, it got us alone together, so that's a win.
 And where is he...other than not here?
 Yeah, and sometimes they don't.
 And sometimes you change, but what you had still means something.
 And sometimes when you're thinking all those things, your girlfriend is moving on, and sleeping with somebody back home, and has no intention of getting back with you.
 It was a while ago. And honestly, until the worst actually happened, I wouldn't listen to anybody telling me otherwise. I could always find an excuse. So, I get it.
 See you Monday, Doc.
 Togavirus. Go.
 Okay, hot shot. Red Queen Theory.
 And why does the supposedly weaker species always stay one step ahead?
 Damn. If Maxfield doesn't let you in, you can have my spot. 
 Is that why you invited me here? To prove to your boyfriend you don't need him?
 I think that guy is doing a keg-stand on his grandad's grave.
 Uh, sorry. I've just kind of wanted to do that since move-in day. Aplastic anemia. Go.
 Keg-stand guy passed out, so I stole these. 
 
 I don't know what you are man, but–
 Let me out of here, please!
 I don't know you, man.
 Don't sound so disappointed.
 Caroline Forbes took me to a party in Mystic Falls, and then...it's kind of a big blank. I must have been really drunk.
 I'm sorry. What?
 Dr. Maxfield, please! Why are you doing this? 
 What are you doing to me?
 What the hell is happening to me? Why am I so hungry? 
 I need your help.
 Just come to my room, please.
 It's a long story. My roomate's going to be home.
 I'm sorry, man.
 It was torture. I was in a cell all day at at night, he would take me out and do experiments on me.
 I don't know. He would starve me and then inject me with some weird blood. What am I supposed to tell my parents? They left me all of these messages. They're wondering where the hell I am.
 I locked him in his lab after I attacked him. Honestly, the whole escape was kind of a blur. I wasn't exactly in my right mind.
 Our stash? You're a vampire too?
 Holy crap. That is insane.
 So, your mom's like me too?
 Your eyes keep scanning the room. You afraid I'm going to go vampire postal on the fourth-floor freshmen?
 Boyfriend? Friend with benefits?
 That feels amazing.
 So, that feeling never goes away?
 Last time I kissed you, you got all weird, and it was awkward, and 
 Yeah. I just got to get out of here.
 What the hell did you do to me?
 Wasn't bad enough that you locked me up and poked me full of needles? Now I want to feed on the girl I like?
 Raaaah!
 I'm not ready. I don't want this.
 Hey. So, you heard?
