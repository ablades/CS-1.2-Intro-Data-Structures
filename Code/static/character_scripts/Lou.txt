 No, Pete owns the place. I'm just the hired help. Name's Lou. What can I do for you?
 Well, have it your way. He should be back in a bit. Hey, what exactly brings you out here?
 Sounds like that gal's screwing with your head.
 You'd be surprised. I've been married five times.
 Pete will be back soon. I should get back to work.
 I murdered one of those wives I told you about. Made it look like an accident.
