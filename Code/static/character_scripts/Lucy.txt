 Oh, Kat, chill.
 Don't attack a witch. It's good to see you girl.
 You called, I came.
 Don't get all boss lady on me. You know I love you.
 Now, where does one wear this?
 What's with the hair?
 Except in man. Isn't it a risk pretending to be her in front of the entire town?
 Hum, okay. Well, have you actually seen the moonstone before? I always thought it was some made up legend.
 Oh yeah? What are you gonna do with it?
 You want me to break the curse.
 No, I'm a plus one, I know no one, but it's a great party though.
 You didn't tell me there was another witch here.
 No, you didn't. No one is supposed to know I'm involved. This changes things, Katherine.
 You looking for me?
 Lucy.
 I should have known I'd run into a Bennett.
 You figure it out. Look, I have no interest in fighting you.
 Give Katherine the moonstone and I will.
 Tell your friends to hand over the moonstone and all will be groovy.
 Look, I don't want to hurt you.
 Look, I don't have a choice. The bitch saved my life and now I owe her. I have to pay up.
 You have the moonstone. I can sense it on you.
 Do you feel that? You can trust me. Give it to me, it's okay.
 Katherine, the spell on this room has been broken, you're free to leave.
 When I hand this over my debt to you is over.
 I owe you nothing.
 You should have told me another witch was involved. She's a Bennett witch, Katherine, but I'm sure you knew that.
 Elena's fine.
 The spell is broken. She'll heal quickly, Bonnie's with her.
 I apologize for my involvement.
 Hey, I'm sorry about that spell. Damn vampires, they pull you into the middle of it every time.
 That feeling you got, you ever felt it before?
 My mother is Joanna, first cousin twice removed from Pauline, niece of Sheila aka...
 Yeah, we kind of are. It's nice to meet you Bonnie. Seeing you tonight was a wakeup call for me. I got to stop letting vampires control me. So thank you for that.
 Unlike me, you're one of the good ones, Bonnie. The middle of it is exactly where you need to be. You take care, cuz. Don't worry, you'll see me again.
 
 AHHHH!
 UHH! UGH!
