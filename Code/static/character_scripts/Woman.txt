 Hey. Did you hear that?
 I heard thunder.
 Are you sure? Because if it rains, then we won't be able to see the comet.
 Stay dry.
 I knew it! I told you it was gonna rain!
 Open! No! Please!
 Honey, you should be on the floor!
 Pearl, it's Harper.
 I don't invite strangers into my home.
 Me, I'm next.
 Me, you promised me.
 Rudy! 
 Can I help you?
 Don't you have a cell phone?
 
 No, I'll get the phone and I'll bring it out to you.
 I'm from Florida.
 I bet you a hundred dollars that dog ran off to a house with air conditioning.
 What's going on?
 He's almost never here. He's on the road mostly.
 Aaaah!
 
 
 Please don't!
 Hello mister Klaus. I have some more information for you. I saw the guys spotted Damon at the farm house.
 Ray! Oh, my God. What's going on? Who are you?
 You're the hybrid.
 I'd rather die than be a vampire.
 Hi.
 Thank you.
 
 
 I have a blanket in my car. Try not to move. I'll call for help.
 What are you doing?
 You were right.
 It was really good.
 Yeah, thanks for inviting me.
 If you're lucky.
 Oh god. Is he...do you think he's dead?
 You okay, hon? You're gonna get yourself sick out here.
 You look just like Elena Gilbert.
 Katherine Pierce, right? I'm supposed to be keeping my eye out for you.
 Yeah, we are together, in love.
 Maybe the turned her to stone part.
 You're in Philly.
 What's going on, babe? Hey. What's going on? Hey. Talk to me.
 Oh, my God. What's happening? 
 Please stop!
 Please!
 Oh, my God!
 I'm ready.
 Am I on the famous Other Side?
 I died.
 A witch. What are you?
 That doesn't seem like it would be a lot of fun for you.
 It's okay, honey. Dying wasn't fun, but then you felt my pain, so I guess you know that. Sorry! But, you know what? The pain's gone now, and seeing a friendly face over here certainly doesn't hurt.
 Perhaps I can help you with that.
 I'm judging your crappy lab.
 Sloan, and I'm here to help you, so you can lose the arrogance. I'm here to offer your new funding for your research.
 Excuse me.
 Are you Tom Avery?
 I got you!
 "Happy Birthday! Wave to me!"
 "How old are you?"
 "How do you add that? You guys want to do some numbers? OK. What's one plus one?"
 "Two plus two?"
 "Nice."
 Doctor, we have a young female with abdominal wounds.
 Who are you?
 Who are you?
 The leftovers. I know, you told me three times. Forty years, and every time, "Did you remember the leftovers?" Like I'm getting senile or something.
 Oh!
 Bonnie, is there something you wanted to talk about?
 Thank you, Bonnie.
 Alex, is there something you'd like to share with the group?
 
 
 What do you want to bet she's doing really well in his class?
 No. Sorry.
 We have a lot of fruit.
 Unh!
 Night, night.
 Apologies.
 I haven't had visitors in years. And then, all of a sudden, two in a matter of days.
 Unfortunately, there is no more. That herb is rare for a reason. It has strong anti-magic  and therefore anti-witch  properties.
 Let's just say this isn't from a bad laser-peel.
 There's not. Witches eradicated it from the world a century ago. This was the only source.
 Help!
 Help! Help! Help!
 Are you lost?
 Hang on.
 Get away from me!
 I saw him. He attacked me.
 
 Yeah, it was an access road off of 274. It was north of Oden. There's an outlook there.
 
 Wait, that's not what I said...
 Hey, let me know if they find my phone.
 My cell phone...
 Are you Damon Salvatore?
 He said if you don't answer this, I'm supposed to run into traffic.
 You're welcome.
