 Toast. I can make toast.
 Your first day of school and I'm totally unprepared. Lunch money?
 Anything else? A number two pencil? What am I missing?
 I'm meeting with my thesis advisor at...now. Crap!
 Okay, have fun. Wait, I got this. Don't stay out late, it's a school night.
 Do I look adult? As in respectfully parental?
 Jeremy's parent-teacher conference. Hair up or down?
 Up it is. You're feisty today.
 He left early. Something about getting to wood shop early to finish a birdhouse.
 There is no wood shop, is there?
 Yeah.
 Mr. Tanner, are you aware that Jeremy and Elena's parents died?
 Younger sister.
 Yes. Six classes? Are you sure? I mean, that's kind of hard to do.
 I'm their sole guardian.
 What are you suggesting, exactly?
 It's been tough, but, no, it's not.
 I picked up dinner. Tacos. I had an urge for guacamole.
 Eat anyway. It's a ruse. I want to talk.
 Hey, you! Come. Sit. 
 Did. Past tense. But, yeah. Loved it. Anything to get a little distraction from life...reality. And it worked. For a while. Never lasts, though. Hey, I'm not saying I wouldn't love to rail back and kick it, but with a thesis looming and a waistline expanding...
 Well, at least it's an ex-girlfriend. Wait till you date a guy with mommy issues or cheating issues. Or amphetamine issues.
 Jeremy? Jeremy, where were you?
 Oh, no, no, no!
 Listen up! Quit ditching class or you're grounded. No discussion.
 No, it's me, the hypocrite patrol.
 I've become my worst nightmare. The authority figure who has to violate a 15-year-old's privacy. Jackpot. I see the hiding places haven't gotten any more creative.
 Your ass-hat of a history teacher shamed me good yesterday.
 "Discover the impossible, Ms. Sommers." Got it. Thanks. Like I didn't know I was screwing up.
 Yes, I am. You know why? Because I'm not her. She made everything look so easy. You know, high school, marriage, having you. I can't do it. I'm gonna say or do the wrong thing, and he's gonna get worse, and it's gonna be my fault. It's impossible.
 Scum ball. Scum bucket.
 Him.
 Also known as Logan "Scum" Fell. Did your mom ever tell you why I moved away from Mystic Falls?
 He is not cute. There's nothing cute about him. What are you doing with that?
 Is that grandma Beth's wedding ring?
 Hello Logan.
 I thought I might see you here.
 I dreaded.
 And now that I have...
 Your hairline's receding.
 Nope.
 Oh, yes, I have. I'm meaner now.
 Shooting implies caring.
 I'm over the banter, Logan. I'd really rather you just left me alone.
 Thank you.
 I know. I saw you.
 Her name was Monica, wasn't it?
 And what is it?
 I fled town because of you. Fled.
 Hypothetically speaking, if allowed, how would you make things right?
 Obvious.
 Yes to lunch. Call me.
 Uh-huh.
 He could be craftier about it, at least make an effort to sneak her in and out. Oh, and just so you know, I won't be home for dinner.
 I'm going to show up and torture him, yes. And have you heard from Stefan?
 Haven't you called him?
 And you're ok with everything?
 Ok, then.
 Hey, Logan.
 You have an hour. Make it count.
 Classy.
 But you're still going to video the girls in bikinis, right?
 Thank you for dinner. I had a nice time.
 Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.
 Nada. Especially not having sex in the minivan.
 You're saying that out loud why?
 Your emotional maturity level when we were together.
 Uh, a very reluctant maybe to both.
 Fine. But you're eating leftovers.
 Logan? Logan?
 Ok. 
 You're wallowing.
 My wallow is legitimate. I was dumped.
 You didn't get a brush-off e-mail say  "I'm leaving town. See ya."
 Why? What are you doing?
 Some sort of replicant.
 I like a man who can dine alone. A quiet strength.
 
 Have you picked a topic?
 That's easy! You've got all your dad's stuff.
 "How the Gilberts came over on the Mayflower" stuff, all that family lineage from way back. Your dad really loved all that family history stuff. It's all boxed up in the closet.
 Jeremy was just telling me about his paper. Thanks for giving him another chance.
 Jeremy totally ditched me.
 Home. It's not far. He can walk it.
 I'm a returnee. Left town for a while, now I'm back.
 School. And then there's the real reason. I was wronged...a guy named Logan.
 Basics...lied, cheated, lured me back in, left me again. Your turn. Any sad relationship stories?
 [awkward[ Oh. Wow.
 What happened?
 So, why'd you move here?
 You're so wrong. I'm much more pathetic.
 Oh no. We haven't even covered high school. Braces, A-cup.
 You can...You know what? I'm not gonna invite you in. 
 So, you found the boxes.
 Me and Logan. That's just cruel.
 
 
 Why are you here, Logan?
 Yeah, I got that email.
 You didn’t send an email?
 I’m not gonna invite you in. Forget it.
 The answer's no.
 
 You’re kidding?
 Psychology major. Check that!
 You and Stefan? Update?
 Where is he going?
 Yours leaves, mine returns.
 He’s back. 
 Ah, medium slam.
 Exactly. No more Logan "Scum" Fell.
 
 Yeah, he was a writer...short stories, horror stuff.
 Well, he was a Gilbert, probably a little bit of both.
 Hide me.
 The scum Fell has landed.
 It’s a form of self-preservation.
 Fake flattery. Stupid, dimpled grin. Puppy dog eyes.
 He was the usual Logan, was charming, a little more manic than usual. He kept trying to convince me to let him in. 
 Career night is the new bowling.
 Where are you? Why didn't you call?
 Are you okay?
 Elena?
 Elena, where are you? Are you okay?
 No, it's not fine! I got a call...
 I don't set a lot of rules, Elena. Not with you. I trust you to tell me the truth. Where were you? Why would you lie to me about it? I thought that we were closer than that.
 Don't do that. Don't turn this back on me. I didn't do anything.
 Elena, I didn't...they asked me not to.
 Spoke to the insurance company. Car's totaled. You can keep using mine for now.
 
 Your mom was gonna do it eventually. I never thought I'd have to.
 Your dad was about to leave the office one night when this girl showed up. She was sixteen, a runaway, and about to give birth. He delivered her baby, and he gave her a place to stay, but a few days later, she disappeared. And there you were. Your parents were trying so hard to have a baby. I-it just wasn't happening. All Miranda ever wanted was to be a mom.
 Your dad was a doctor, Elena. He took care of it. They didn't wanna lose you, so they kept it quiet, told as few people as possible, but if anyone ever wanted proof, they had documentation.
 Just her name. Isobel.
 Alaric.
 I figured I'd stand out less if I dressed up.
 Ok, I'm a sucker for the decade dance. I went to school here, you know. They do the sixties and seventies, too, FYI.
 I'm really starting to see a change in Jeremy. Finally.
 From someone who knows. You have no idea what happened?
 Is it ok to talk about your wife?
 That must be impossible to deal with, not having any answers.
 Maybe one day.
 Thank you. I needed that.
 I'm glad I could help.
 Is that what this was, a date?
 Oh.
 
 Isobel?
 Where was Isobel from?
 There were a few guys. Logan isn't the only loser I've dated.
 He's not missing. He's in the Bahamas working on his tan. Very entitled, that one. Marches to his own drum. 
 Hey. Where have you been? We're cooking dinner.
 
 What are you doing with all this stuff?
 Have you told Jeremy?
 You know you're not staying the night, right?
 You're lucky I like you. Keep the door open.
 Yeah.
 She went to the bathroom.
 He has a friend over.
 What are you doing out here? It's cold.
 Right.
 Come on inside.
 Your dad kept everything from his medical practice—records, logs, old appointment books. 
 Pregnant teenage runaway? Probably not. First name, maybe. But where'd she get Peterson? Classmate? Best friend? So I binged it. 
 Well, watch this.
 Trudie still lives there. 
 I couldn't find anything about her. 
 She died.
 In this town, fundraising is like indentured servitude. You don't have a choice. Besides, you're a bachelor, and you're eligible, so there you go.
 Oh, god. I can't believe I'm gonna do this.
 I am totally going to ruin this moment, but I I have to tell you. Elena recently found out she was adopted, and she's been looking for her birth mother...whose name was Isobel.
 Are you sure? Not before you were together?
 This is Elena's birth mother.
 That's a good look for you.
 Yep. That's  that's the one.
 No, I'm sorry for dropping it on you, but I felt like you should know.
 At some point, maybe you and Elena could talk. I'm sure she'd like to hear about Isobel, what she was like.
 Uh...Or not. No pressure.
 Are you okay?
 That's me.
 Yes. Hi Pearl.
 Of course, Jeremy's friend.
 Oh, Jenna, please. This property was in my brother in law's family for generations. It's one of the originals structure in Mystic Falls. It used to be one of those old fashioned drugstore thingies.
 Yeah.
 Sorry if it's a little musty.
 No one has been here for months.
 Kelly? Kelly Donovan?
 I heard you were back in town. She used to babysit me.
 This woman is crazy.
 I'm not anymore.
 I shouldn't. I'm more responsible now. Haven't you heard?
 This is not going to end well.
 Don't be grumpy. It can't be that bad.
 Hide. We're not here.
 Children under our care. Five o'clock. This is not good.
 That would be my queue.
 Oh yeah.
 See you guys.
 Damn it! Stupid shoe.
 Thanks, I think.
 The one and only. You know him?
 He lives in the old boarding house by Wickery Bridge. He's still in there if you want to say hi.
 Oh, nice. Very smooth with the shoe and the flirt. But, I'm a little drunk and a guy plus drunk me equals very bad things.
 Sorry. That was a seriously lame pick up.
 I don't know it was a gift. And that is a cab so...
 Regret. Make sure you lock that up.
 Forgot this. (She gives her a thermos.)
 John, you made it.
 Oh what you say and what you do are typically two very different things.
 He just lost a friend, so try to be sensitive.
 Right, so really how long are you staying?
 Actually I did.
 It's not up to you or me; it belongs to Jeremy and Elena.
 It will be our role to break the tradition.
 Hmm, the Gilbert family legacy. I forgot how sacred it was. I'm not a Gilbert so I was never cool enough to hear it.
 I'm standing right here.
 How do I look?
 Here I am. I haven't seen you in a while.
 Sure.
 Not so excited that we have another month of these Founders' Day events.
 No need, we're going with Rick.
 Jeremy can ride with you.
 Don't thank me until you're sure your hair isn't gonna burn off.
 So were you if I recall.
 I hate to break it to you, but its a little late for cold feet.
 Well I tell you one thing, your hair would have a better chance if she was.
 What is she doing with Damon?
 Jer, are you ready?
 His friend, Anna.
 Why so nosy?
 She's new in town, I think. She and her mom Pearl, the family who you're so rudely trying to prevent from buying Grayson's building.
 Yes, so?
 How is Anna? I like that girl, she has fire.
 Oh please! I'm eating.
 We're all laughing.
 Suck it in, baby.
 It's late, you should probably come inside.
 What are you doing?
 Elena, I came as soon as I got your message. How is John?
 At the fire department, I had to fill out a report. I told you earlier.
 Yes, I did.
 Yes, I did.
 Looks like the whole town has turned out.
 That's what people do. The Lockwoods were here for us when we went through this. It'll be quick; we'll drop off the food and pay our respects and go.
 It's been a while.
 I want you to know it means a lot to me that Elena has a connection to her mother. I appreciate you bringing her along today.
 Uh...no, don't do that. Not the half maybe apology hope for the future thing.
 Elena?! Are you coming?
 Do what you need to do okay?
 Yeah, just, men and their baggage.
 Ric, I wasn't expecting you and Elena until later.
 Well, she's not the plus one I'm worried about. Why is Damon coming?
 I'll be nice when Damon learns to keep his paws off you.
 You're here for 10 minutes and I'm already back under the bleachers at the pep rally.
 Thank Rick, it was his idea.
 I have no secrets. Only dirty shame.
 Damon.
 Here. Use mine.
 Dress! Ballerina!
 A dog! Hound-dog!
 How is that a wolf?
 There you are. Isn't this fun?
 Did I have a choice?
 No, you don't. You've never dated you; I have dated many you's.
 Thanks. My mother's silver set.
 My first mistake. Mason was a catch; he had girls lining up.
 I prefer the term "role model"
 And you are a terrible artist.
 I'm still deciding.
 Of course, it's for a good cause. Plus, I have always been a sucker for the Masquerade Ball.
 Stefan, hey!
 I'm cooking dinner tonight. Ric will be there, you should come.
 Really?
 Because that's not what it sounded like this morning.
 Light sleeper. You know what? I heard nothing.
 You're pretty handy with that thing.
 Table.
 Of course, I understand. Elena, it's for you.
 Hey, stop fussing, I'm fine.
 Yeah, the only thing I'm gonna die from is embarrassment.
 I walked into a knife. How does somebody do that?
 I feel like an invalid.
 He already left for the Lockwood party.
 Yeah, I'm glad. He needs to have more fun. Lose some of that emo thing.
 Good night.
 That was us. I'm sorry.
 But here you are.
 I'm really really sorry.
 I know he's been staying over a lot. Are you  - are you sure it's okay?
 
 So now I'm playing historical society hostess to some writer who's doing his book on small town Virginia.
 Lame, yeah, but Carol Lockwood played the "dead husband" card, said she was too busy to deal. Plus, my sister kept most of the archives, so there you have it.
 Perfect timing.
 Your mom's files from the Historical Society. I got roped into helping Mrs. Lockwood and by roped, I mean very excited to participate.
 Elijah's in town doing research on Mystic Falls.
 So you're welcome to stay here and rummage through this stuff or Elena and I could help you load it into your car.
 Also a good plan.
 Oh God, I'm late.
 What the hell?
 It's okay I'm confused, right? Because we were not expecting you, like, ever.
 I'm still confused here.
 Not here, you're not.
 Actually I can, as legal guardian.
 Okay, what's going on?
 What?!
 I can't believe it. Elena is my sister's husband's brother's daughter and her mother is my boyfriend's deceased wife. You can't make this stuff up.
 I can't believe that they kept it a secret. How is it even possible to keep a secret like that?
 Ugh!
 Do you have to?
 So, my friend wants to meet you. Damon Salvatore, this is...
 Damon, what are you doing here?
 At the lake house for the weekend.
 Yes, with Stefan.
 I did. Until you get a lawyer, file for guardianship, it's my call, and there's nothing you can do about it.
 She wanted to get away from you, okay, and so do I, so I'll be staying with Ric.
 You are on dangerous ground.
 What?
 She died.
 What are you saying?
 There you are. Are you OK?
 No. It's fine. I'm just glad you're OK.
 Sure. Sounds great.
 Good night.
 The old Fell property actually starts just beyond that fence.
 Why do you say it like that?
 Massachusetts? As in the witch trials?
 Well, I bet it was the men who made a big deal about being founders back in 1860. Men are very territorial.
 Elijah, this is my friend, Alaric Saltzman.
 Well, I only brought the surveys. I got that list in the car. Just give me a sec.
 Hey, guys.
 Yeah, I guess you could say that.
 Yeah, I'm free.
 I don't know. I really like him. It's more than like and I want it to work, but I can't help but feel that he's hiding something from me. And then I've got John whispering things in my ear about him.
 Things I don't want to believe. Things I don't believe, not if they're coming from John's mouth.
 Who invited him?
 Nice to see you.
 Thank you.
 I hate to break it to you, Damon, but according to Elijah, your family is so not a founder of this town.
 Hmm. Because they were witches.
 I wouldn't repeat this to the Historical Society.
 Here you are, gentleman, make yourself useful. Hmm?
 Um, I got it.
 Yeah, fine, Ric.
 Sorry, guys, dessert is taking longer than I thought. I usually just unwrap food.
 Maybe the same place the rest of the dinner party ran off to.
 What happened to Isobel?
 That's not an answer.
 That's not an answer, either.
 I keep thinking that maybe it's me. Maybe I'm reading into things. I should trust you. That's what a relationship is about, right? But then I think that maybe John is right and maybe you're not being honest with me. So...are you being honest?
 Right, okay. Well, that was an answer.
 What's going on?
 Oh.
 You heard about my fight with Ric.
 Is this some kind of disguised attempt to cheer me up?
 You, too?
 Okay, then.
 It's this whole Isobel thing. He's hiding something from me.
 Well, that's not his call to make. I mean, I deserve the truth. Everybody does.
 Not if it's somebody you care about, it isn't.
 In.
 I need a drink.
 Not tonight, Ric. Tonight I have traded you for señor tequila.
 Well, the two of you have a lot in common.
 Yeah, well, it's your fault. Because whatever it is you're keeping from me, Whatever you think I can't handle...You're wrong. 'Cause last year I was a grad student who smoked a lot of pot and couldn't keep a goldfish alive and now I'm a parent, so I think I can handle anything, Ric.
 This isn't going to end well.
 I have to find Elena.
 Thanks for getting me home. That was kind of crazy.
 Good night, Ric.
 Tonight was very weird.
 Are John and Jeremy asleep?
 If I go to bed right now, there's a chance I'll wake up hangover-free.
 Who's that?
 Again?
 You knew she was still alive? Ric? John? Did they know?
 No.
 I don't want you here, Ric. You need to go.
 Rage and betrayal would pretty much cover it.
 I'm going to stay on campus. I have a thesis to write, and I don't want to be in this house.
 Elena, I need you to go to the Lockwood's today and accept the Historical Society's check for your mom's foundation.
 I don't have it in me to hear any more lies from you.
 Hey, Stefan. It's Jenna.
 Where's Elena? And Jeremy? No one's answering their phones.
 She left me all these weird messages telling me to stay away from Rick. What's going on?
 Oh, that's kinda hard to do from my kitchen.
 Yeah. What's going on? Where's Elena? I'm supposed to meet Ric at the Grill for lunch, to talk.
 Um, Stefan...
 I'm still waiting for someone to tell me what the hell's going on.
 Tell me what?
 Why are we talking about this?
 Are you joking?
 Werewolves. Werewolves. Now I know you're joking.
 Get out.
 I don't know what it is you're trying to do or why you're saying these things, but...
 I said get out!
 Fine! I'll go.
 Stefan!
 Stefan!
 But you're...you...
 No.
 When I was little, your mom used to tell me bedtime stories. Stories about vampires. I never thought that what she said could be true.
 Who else knows? Jeremy?
 John?
 Protect me?
 No, Elena...I am the one who's supposed to be protecting you and Jeremy.
 No, this is  this is so...I don't know how...it's...
 Why didn't you tell me?! I'm scared.
 Get out!
 Get out!
 Stay away from me.
 Okay, it's him.
 I saw him go upstairs.
 Oh, my God.
 Yeah.
 Can I?
 Hey. I'm glad you're okay. I should have said that already.
 Oh, my head. What's wrong with me?
 You called me. You were so scared. Oh, ah, I should have realized that it wasn't you. The second I walked out of the house, someone grabbed me. A vampire.
 He made me drink his blood. And I don't...I don't remember anything after that. 
 Why don't I remember anything?
 Yeah, if you die with vampire blood in your system, it's...
 I'm a vampire?
 I can't.
 I feel like myself...Only not. Everything is brighter. The fire's hotter. Part of me is terrified, but there's another part of me that doesn't want to feel anything.
 
 Who's that?
 The day that the lawyers called to tell me that I was going to become your guardian, you know what my first thought was? 
 It's just the thought that I almost passed up taking care of you.
 Look around, Elena. I failed you.
 
 Elena, don't.
 What's going on?
 I can't-I can't make it out.
 I can hear him. I hear Stefan.
 Oh, my god.
 He wants to take my place.
 Elena...
 It's alright, Elena. I know what I have to do.
 Hey.
 He's fourteen. They don't think.
 Hey! You'll get me in trouble.
 Your dad is making me play Pictionary. I suck at Pictionary.
 Bite me, Grayson.
 Oh, having second thoughts about ditching family night?
 What point?
 Like this one?
 Remember when you compelled me to stab myself?
