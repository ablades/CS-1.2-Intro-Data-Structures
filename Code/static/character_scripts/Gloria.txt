 Guess who my eyes have just spied, ladies? Looking for a good time, Mr. Salvatore?
 You got to be kidding me.
 Stop. You may be invincible, but that doesn't make you funny.
 I remember you.
 Old and dead? Now if I die, who's going to run this place, huh?
 I can slow the aging down some. Herbs and spells. But don't worry, it'll catch up to me one day.
 Don't. I know why you're here. A hybrid out to make more hybrids? That kind of news travels.
 Obviously you did something wrong. Look, every spell has a loophole, but a curse that old...We'd have to contact the witch who created it.
 I know. And for me to contact her, I'll need help. Bring me Rebekah.
 She has what I need. Bring her to me.
 Well, look what the wind blew in. Last I heard, you hated this place.
 I always did like you better. But I see your brother is still running in the wrong crowd.
 With Klaus. Bad combo.
 They'll be back here later tonight. They're out running a little errand for me.
 I don't think so. You may be cute, but you're still a vampire.
 Where's Rebekah?
 Last call. Drink 'em up!
 Not in my bar. You take it outside.
 It's hard to find something when you don't have anything to go on.
 See? Now this one offers a solution.
 All right, give me your hand, sweetheart.
 I can sense something.
 Anta Cotis Syrum, Anta Cotis Syrum...
 I found it.
 It doesn't work like that, doll. I get images. There's a girl with her friends...
 Well, I'll have to dive back in to get the details.
 I need more time.
 And space. You're harshing my ju-ju.
 I'm sure you can. But that's not what I asked.
 There you are.
 Well, now we both have a secret.
 It's what I heard that's interesting. You know, the girls with the necklace, they were talking about you.
 'Cause I wouldn't help that hybrid half-breed with anything. The necklace is a talisman from the original witch herself. I want it.
 Don't be difficult. You know, I'd hate to have to tell Klaus what a liar his sidekick is.
 Guess I've got to get it out of you the hard way, huh?
 Relax. It's just a little paralysis spell. Nothing major.
 Just got to get the information out of your pretty little head. You know, witches nowadays, they're into that new age stuff, but...I'm a little more old school voodoo.
 This will stop that pesky healing.
 You don't have to.
 You feel that? That's your essence. Your spirit. It lets me make a connection. Herbs help, too. Diviners, sage, witch hazel.
 But my personal favorite...
 Vervain.
 I'm impressed. You've got discipline, Stefan. It's not going to do you much good, but...Just let go, honey.
 There you go, there you go.
 There's the girl with the necklace. You love her. You'd do anything for her. And you have. A lot of darkness, a lot of guilt. All to keep her away from Klaus. Why would he be interested in one girl?
 She's the doppelg√§nger. She's supposed to be dead, and that's why Klaus can't make hybrids, isn't it?
