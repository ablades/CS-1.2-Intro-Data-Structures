 As the guidance counselor, you'll first meet with me individually and then you'll have an open house with your child's teachers,
 Elena! It's good to see you
 Although you're not on the list as Jeremy's primary contact.
 Okay. Sorry to keep you waiting. Bad news first – Jeremy's missed 11 days of shool, he's started three fights and he's been caught cheating in math class... twice.
 I'm sorry, you are Elena's...
 Actually, it's relevant. Most problems in school are rooted in problems at home. Jeremy's in desperate need of a stable living situation. People who care about giving him that, more than their own needs–
 I hope so, for Jeremy's sake.
