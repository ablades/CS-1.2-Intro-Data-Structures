 Well, no diagnosis yet. His blood work came back completely normal.
 Why do you say that?
 I don't think you should be telling me this.
 Mm. And your brother is an organ donor. Yes, I saw that on his intake form. Look, it doesn't do any good to speculate.
 Yeah, I know her. She's a patient of mine. She's a really good kid.
 I can't think like that, sadly. As a doctor, every life has to be as important as the next.
 Well, whatever you feel about your brother's past...
 What? My parents were killed by a drunk driver. Why would you say that?
 His blood pressure's bottoming out. He barely has a heartbeat.
 Please don't talk.
 I-I think you shouldn't be in here.
 I took an oath to help people.
 We can't predict the future.
 This is not about me.
 I-I think you should leave. Now.
 I appreciate you saying that... but it's just not enough.
 No, but it'll change your future.
 Time of death... 2 47 p.m.
 Sorry for your loss.
 Okay, I know you must be in shock.
 That would be insane. And cruel.
 Oh, God.
 You wanted him dead. You tricked me.
 You're... dead.
 You were in on it?
