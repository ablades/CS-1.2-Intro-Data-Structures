 You're staying behind.
 Elena Gilbert, I presume? I'm Finn Mikaelson. You're here to see my mother.
 Her request did not include your friends.
 If you want to see my mother, you'll need to be alone.
 Excuse me.
 You're alone. Wise choice.
 Are we all right to speak freely?
 You aren't having second thoughts, are you?
 You're doing the right thing, mother.
 I understand. When it is time, I will be ready to die.
 My mother has released me from an eternity of shame. It's not a sacrifice, it's a gift.
 They're coming, Mother!
 Stay beside me, mother.
 Mother!
 Hello Niklaus. I have nothing to say to you.
 Gone to find another way to end our abominable lives. And when she does, I will sacrifice myself all over again.
 I have no wish to help you. Only to see you dead.
 Oh, bother someone else with your hollowed charms, Niklaus.
 I have no wish to be unlinked.
 What happens to one, happens to all. You may not feel the effects of the dagger, but you'd lose your precious Rebekah.
 You're siding with him? Rebekah, he stored us in boxes.
 What are you gonna do? Kill me?
 You can't force me to help you.
 Sage!
 If memory serves me, this is where the Natives use to make sacrifices to their Gods.
 I assumed after 900 years you'd moved on.
 Mm-mm.
 Happy now?
 I'm truly awed by the evolution of mankind.
 You know him?
 You turned him? Why?
 How many people have you turned?
 Exactly Sage, I turned you. My passion overtook my morals.
 To living life.
 Vervain.
