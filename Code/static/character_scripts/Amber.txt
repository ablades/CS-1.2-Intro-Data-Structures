 I was surprised to have been selected since I'm not from one of the founding families.
 Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood!
 I hate being the center of attention. I get panic attacks.
 Actually I'm just- I'm gonna go get some air.
 Oh God, sorry!
 Where are we going?
 I'm in the ceremony.
 I'm in the parking lot with you.
 You seem sad.
 Do you want to hurt me?
 What's stopping you?
 Then don't.
 One taste.
 What's the matter?
 It's okay, it doesn't hurt that much, just not so hard next time.
 You told me not to be.
 Amber.
 You said to run!
