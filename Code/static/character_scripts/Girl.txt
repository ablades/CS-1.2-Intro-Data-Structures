 Well, thank you, Elena Gilbert, whoever you are.
 Where are we going?
 Did you hear something?
 
 Bye.
 How do I taste?
 I don't think it's wrong for me to win two years in a row.
 You're welcome.
 Would you like some lemonade?
 Some maintenance man had a heart attack. He just dropped dead.
 Eddie?
 Uh, yeah, I guess so.
 Sure. Uh â€“ let me check.
 It's my little sister.
 Double pepperoni, three days in a row. You guys eat anything else?
 Sorry, guys.
 No, I'm just an idiot. I ran out of gas, and my phone's dead. You think I could use yours?
 
 Car drama. Your friend just went to go get his phone.
 Thanks.
 Did you find your phone?
 Oh, my god. You guys, I left my makeup bag on the bus.
 
 
 Oh, my god, you startled me.
 Katherine, what are you doing?
 Of course. And I know most people around here prefer you to feed from the neck, but I asked you to drink from my wrist, remember?
 Katherine Pierce. I love the new 'do, by the way.
 
 
 
 It's- been a while. I can't remember.
 I don't know.
 Well, you said we could all be friends with you, as long as we kept your secret.
 
 Katherine, hey. What brings you by at this hour?
 Oh, of course. Like I said, your secret would be safe here.
 Hey, um...all the secrecy. Can I ask, what is it?
 Did you do it in that tone? Because I think I know why he didn't.
 I was till I realized how mean that girl was to me.
 Um, I have self-respect. It may have taken me till I was halfway to the sip and serve to realize it, but I have it.
 I don't know. Right around route 13 when you get into Mystic Falls. Sorry about your warm booze.
 What are you doing?
 It's called practice. Is he okay?
 Ahhhh!
 Can I have one of the boy toys?
 Ma!
 Ma!
 
  Tell me a story.
 What kind of story?
 Something happy.
 A long time ago, in a village built on this very spot, lived a man. Arcadius. Cade, to his friends, of which he had many. He was a gentle man, loved and respected. But Cade could do something that no one else could  he could see into the minds of others.
 He was psychic?
 The first psychic. It was this power that gave him so much empathy towards others. And it was this power that would cost him his life.
 Cade had only wanted to help. But he had overstepped. And the men, fearing his power, turned even Cade's friends against him. And it was then that Cade came to know the thing inside men that even his power had not been able to divine  true evil.
 I asked for a happy story.
 But it is, dear sister. For in death, Cade was triumphant. From that moment onward, evil men would be forever punished for their wicked deeds. Cade had his revenge. And someday, so will we.
 Help me, please!
 Call out to them with me.
 They will never hear us.
 Raise your voice, and your mind will soar out to meet it.
 They heard us. The ship is coming our way. We are saved. Over here.
 The tides were not in our favor today. This is all that washed up.
 You knew this would happen?
 The island is barren, save for berries and wild boar. This way is easier... and more fun. Sister, do not weep for them. Those sailors were from our village. The same men who banished us here to die.
 Never again. If we cannot live off of what God has provided for us, then we are not meant to live at all. Promise me?
 Gas leak, we're being evacuated.
