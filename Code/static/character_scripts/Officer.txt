 That's not all. 
 Can't go out this way
 Sorry.
 All good here.
 You want more vervain? Keep it down.
 Sorry, not my problem.
 I got this. Bring the other one in.
 I thought I told you to shut up.
 I'd much rather watch you die.
 Can I help you?
 Accident up at Wickery bridge. Driver lost control, careened off into the water.
 Two.
One. We found her up on the bank unconscious. She must have crawled out of the car and passed out.
 Miranda and Grayson, her parents.
 Calling Sheriff Forbes. This is the last call for Sheriff Forbes. No response. Radio Number 2-6 is out of service after twelve years and four months of police service. Gone, but never forgotten. Center!
 Marty Hammond?
 Have you been drinking, sir?
 Sir, could you stand up for me?
 Maybe... First, I'm gonna have to ask you to walk in a straight line.
 Nice work, Marty. And back to me.
 That you were under the influence when you were driving the bus.
 What the hell happened to you?
 
 Here you go.
 Then you're not giving me much of a choice.
 Marty Hammond, you're under arrest for driving under the influence 
 Stop. Calm down!
 Calm down, Marty...
 All right, you asked for it 
 Hey! Get back here! Stop! STOP!
 
 
 The car went off the bridge. Sheriff, we found the third victim.
 Was it an accident?
 We'll need to drag the river.
 Three bodies recovered.
 It's the Gilberts.
 We have an AMBER Alert out for two missing children. Mind if I take a look inside?
 Thanks for your time. Sorry to bother you folks.
 What the hell...
 Hands where I can see 'em! Step out of the car, now! 
 And when did you last see your mom?
 Is there someone we can call? A family member?
 Come on, keep it moving! This way, this way.
