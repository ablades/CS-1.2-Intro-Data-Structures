 Tyler?
 What happened to you? In my mind you're twelve years old.
 Good to see you again.
 Hey, what's going on in here Tyler?
 You have somewhere else to be? (He motions for the flask.)
 Hey, Tyler! Hey, hey!
 Tyler!
 Look at me. Look at me. Calm down. Settle down.
 Your mom's out. I think she popped a couple of pharmaceuticals.
 It's the curse of being a Lockwood.
 I didn't. I've just learned how to manage it.
 None of us do. That's why it's a curse, Tyler.
 Six. I don't count the last one. You crawled it.
 I think Grandma Lockwood actually passed you, in her walker.
 Yeah, yeah.
 So all this anger and aggression you're talking about, you notice a difference when you exercise?
 Do you have episodes? What happens exactly?
 You black out?
 Is there a pattern? Like once a month, only at night?
 Nothing, just killing time, waiting for you.
 Yeah, actually. You know where I can find any family artifact stuff? Heirlooms?
 I did that when I was 22. No, I'm just looking for this old piece of my mom's. My dad gave it to her when they got married. It's a sentimental value. Probably passed down to your dad. Could still be in the house here somewhere.
 It's a moon stone  about the size of a hockey puck. Old, ugly, minimal monetary value.
 Yeah, cool, I'll do that. You're ready?
 I bet I can take you.
 Your brother's wrong.
 Hey Tyler! Tyler! What the hell man?
 All right, we're home.
 Told you to leave it alone.
 Brazilian martial art. I took some classes a while back.
 I'm not lying.
 You didn't see anything.
 Reflection of a car headlight maybe, that's all.
 Yes.
 Tyler! You want to know what you saw? You saw me get pissed off that I had to pull your delinquent ass out of a fight!
 I appreciate that Carol.
 Hey man, you heading up?
 Hey, I'm sorry about earlier, we're all good?
 All right.
 Hey. What you guys are talking about?
 Neither. Hoping you can make sure everyone is out of here by dark.
 Someone ends up wasted and dead at the bottom of the lake.
 You heard your mom. The family is liable if anything happens.
 Hey, I didn't say you had to stop partying, I just said you had to take it elsewhere.
 Wanna toss me those?
 No, man, barbecue at Jenna Sommers' house.
 Tyler, what do you want me to say man? Yes, I turned into wolf. No, it's not gonna happen to you.
 Because you're not gonna trigger the curse. Your dad didn't know anything about any of this neither did I until it happened to me.
 Ignorance is bliss, trust me.
 I can't say anything more, I'm sorry, Tyler. It's just better for you if I don't.
 Do you know where it is?
 I told you, it was my mom's. It's sentimental. Look, just don't worry about it. Forget I even brought it up, alright? See you later.
 Good news! I found the shot glasses!
 Like old times, huh? Only I didn't swipe this bottle from my old man.
 Just happy to be invited.
 Really?
 I've got dirt. I've got dirt.
 We haven't met. Mason Lockwood.
 I know. I heard great things about you.
 "Dances with Wolves"
 Sure.
 I apologize, I'm an animal.
 She was always lost in Logan Fell land.
 I'm sure I wasn't half the lady killer you were. How about a toast? To new friends.
 Jenna just brought out "Guitar Hero". Might be time to mutiny!
 Okay. Enough with the innuendos, you win, you're hilarious.
 Come on, man. You don't think I know what this barbecue is about?
 It doesn't matter; I'm not your enemy, Damon.
 That was a mistake.
 There was confusion; I couldn't chain myself up in time. I have no control once I shift.
 I'm serious. Let's not spark some age-old feud that doesn't apply to us.
 I lost my brother, my nephew lost his father. I'm here for my family. Let's be above this.
 No more takers for drinks at the Grill? It's like I'm with a bunch of adults here!
 Okay. Well, thanks for having me, it was awesome. Alaric, catch that game next week?
 Damon? What? More dog jokes?
 You know, I think it was werewolves who started this whole silver myth. Probably for moments like this.
 I was really looking forward to last call. Now you made an enemy.
 Not great. Are you still pissed?
 Yep.
 Do you think this is a joke? If you know where it is then tell me.
 If I tell you, you won't be able to think about anything else. I don't want that for you.
 You think that you can handle it, tough guy? You have no idea.
 Tell me where it is!
 You have to kill somebody! Human blood! You take another person's life away from them and then the curse is yours forever! Can you handle that?
 All right, Carlos. That's it for me.
 Hey Jimmy. Easy. Let's get you home.
 What are you talking about? You've had too much to drink.
 Dude! What's up?! It's me, Mason! I'm not messing with Marla. You know that!
 You don't want to do this buddy.
 Jimmy? Jimmy?
 He kept coming at me. He got in his head that I was sleeping with his girlfriend.
 No. No. I wouldn't do that, he was my friend. He was drunk and attacked me. It was self-defense.
 On every full moon, I lose control. If I don't sedate myself and chain myself down, I'll kill anything in my path. You have to be careful. All it takes is an accident, a car wreck. Any death at your hands and you'll have a lifetime of this. You don't want it Tyler, trust me.
 All right. Where's the moonstone? A deal's a deal. I answered your questions.
 I told you, it's just something I want. Sentimental value.
 Do you know where it is or not?
 Stefan right? The other Salvatore.
 Not interested.
 You think?
 I made that same offer to your brother. He turned it down with a knife.
 Tell your brother to watch his back.
 If he comes at me...
 Hey Sheriff, you've got a second?
 Alright Liz. I was hoping to talk to you about the council.
 I know you and the others founding families have a secret council.
 I know I rejected all that but it's only because I wanted a life outside of this town, not because I was a non-believer. Look, I know vampires exist and you have two of them living right under your nose.
 Yeah.
 Damon and Stefan Salvatore.
 I know it's a lot to digest.
 Think about it. When did the vampire attacks begin? When Damon and Stefan Salvatore moved to town?
 They've evolved. It's not 1864. They figured it out, Liz.
 What if I can prove it to you?
 Thank you.
 Doing my part.
 Nice guy.
 Nice is overrated.
 You have a good day, Damon.
 It's down the stairs to the left.
 Old slave quarters from the original Lockwood house.
 You're gonna kill them, right?
 Liz, I don't care about...
 Don't take any chances.
 What are you two doing out here?
 Yeah Elena, I've seen him. Seen Damon too.
 You don't need me for that. I'll let your friend here sniff them out.
 Does your mother know what you are? I'm happy to tell her.
 Don't be stupid! Necks snap easy around here.
 Wanna bet?
 Hey Sheriff, it's Mason Lockwood. I just want to make sure everything went okay today. I didn't see you later and...give me a call will you?
 Hey.
 What?
 I know.
 Thank you.
 Jimmy attacked me.
 He said that I hit on Marla.
 He's dead. I killed him.
 I thought you would be happy about that.
 Why do you even care?
 I got it.
 Why are you staying here?
 I love it.
 Somewhere safe.
 I don't trust anyone.
 No, you won't.
 Ow! Kath, easy!
 What happens once I give you the moonstone?
 I'll bring it tonight, I promise.
 I love you too.
 Hey, Stefan.
 Wasn't expecting you here. Or anywhere.
 What did you do to Sheriff Forbes?
 Not a problem.
 Excuse me.
 Hey, can you move your van? I'm blocked in.
 Hey, how did you get stuck doing that by yourself?
 Here, let me give you a hand.
 What?!
 She's here with me. Why do you ask, you jealous?
 Screw you!
 The well! You can find it there.
 I'm getting it for Katherine.
 She's gonna use it to lift the curse.
 So I wouldn't have to turn anymore.
 Because she loves me.
 I'm done talking.
 Just help Tyler. Don't let this happen to him.
 I love her!
 "It's September 15   2 hours from the first full moon since I triggered the curse".
 This is going to be fun.
 Hurts, doesn't it?
 God, I miss whiskey.
 One of you will pay for this, right? Cheers.
 Actually, I want an apology.
 That's why I'm here. To help Tyler.
 Not necessarily. Not if you found a weapon that could kill him.
 I know you need to apologize.
 That's good enough.
 Meet me at the old Lockwood cellar. Bring a shovel. 
 Don't tempt me.
 I'm surprised you showed.
 Mikael? Yeah. That didn't turn out so great, did it?
 There's not much to do on the other side but sit around and watch other people screw things up.
 There's an old Lockwood family legend about a weapon that can kill an Original vampire. Like the rest of their secrets, they kept it buried.
 Go for it.
 What, you think I'm leading you into a trap?
 You talk the talk, but I know you'll do anything for your brother. You won't screw me over as long as we have the same agenda.
 I don't know. Flip a coin.
 I'm a ghost. I'm not God. Go left.
 Or not...You have trust issues. Anyone ever tell you that?
 Sorry. Thought you might need this.
 You're welcome.
 You know what the other side is like? We're all alone. We watch the people we left behind and we regret our decisions. That's it. Look, I can't change what happened to me. But maybe I can change what happens to Tyler. I don't need revenge, Damon. I need redemption.
 What now?
 I'm not stopping just 'cause you're stuck. I'll let you know what I find.
 Looks like you're gonna have to trust me.
 It's in...
