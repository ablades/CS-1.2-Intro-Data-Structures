 Hey kid. Chicago P.D.
 Oh, I'm not here for you. Have you seen these two?
 Wrap it up, boys. We're through here.
 No! Get it away!
 Get it away from me!
 Thank you.
 I apologize for my outburst. It would have made more sense had you known that I've been denying myself human blood for as long as I can remember. Why is it that you awoke me?
 Would you mind helping me with these? I can assure you there's no way I can kill Klaus from beneath them.
 I can kill Klaus. And I will.
 Thank you.
 I don't feed on living things.
 That is precisely my problem.
 So, why don't you teach me that trick, young warrior?
 
 You are foolish and impulsive, my boy. What? No more laughter?
 Some days, it's a miracle you're still alive, boy.
 Please, Ayana! I implore you! You must call upon the spirits before the next full moon.
 Everything could be heightened. Our family could live forever...
 If she will not protect our family...then it is in your hands alone, my love.
 We must finish what we started! 
 Maybe I can help with that.
 The Salvatore boys, I presume?
 Is Klaus out of the country?
 Has he spoken to you since he left?
 All right. Can you tell me the last time you spoke to Niklaus?
 You see, Damon...
 Careful, Stefan. One move - and his heart's gone. 
 Really? His link to Klaus is so strong that he will let his own brother die?  No ideas, hmm? Think, Stefan! I guess you're right. He's a dead end. And so are you, Damon.
 And there is our loophole. Just had to rile him up a bit. Get Klaus back to Mystic Falls, and I will gladly drive a stake through his heart. Fail, I'll drive it through yours.
 Then I shall be dead.
 Well that means our plan is working. Klaus will absolutely want to see my body. You lure him here, and I will kill him.
 Well, I'm in possession of a stake fashioned from the wood of the ancient white oak tree. The one that left these ashes when it burned.
 Not here. The knowing of its location is my insurance policy.
 You leaving this in my heart. You see, a vampire can't dagger an original without dying. So...it falls to you.
 Klaus will leave nothing to chance- especially when it comes to trust.
 Rebekah.
 I see. Where is my dagger?
 You were never what I was after.
 He blinded you, Rebekah. He killed your mother!
 Rebekah...
 Did my daughter go to the dance?
 I did.
 None taken.
 It's the only weapon on this earth that can kill an original. So I think I'll hold on to it. No offense.
 Well, technically you could still offer.
 I had a hand in creating vampires, but bloodlust was never my intention. Over the centuries I learned to feed from the predator, not the innocent.
 I'm afraid he is in for a colossal disappointment.
 Well that certainly occurred to me.
 Hello, Niklaus.
 Or you can come outside if you want.
 They can't kill me.
 The big bad wolf. You haven't changed. Still hiding behind your playthings like a coward. You only forget. They may be sired by you, but they're still part vampire. And they can be compelled by me.
 Come out and face me, Niklaus. Or she dies.
 If she dies, this lot will be last of your abominations.
 To what end, Niklaus? So you can live forever, with no one at your side? Nobody cares about you any more, boy! What do you have other than those whose loyalty you forced? No one. No one.
 Come outside and face me, you little coward. And I won't have to.
 Your impulse, Niklaus. It has and will forever be the one thing that keeps you from truly being great.
 Katherine...
