 Jenna.
 It's good to see you.
 You knew it.
 But were secretly hoping.
 Whoa, hey, not so fast. I know you. You have a lot more insults in you, I can tell.
 No, it's not. You want to have lunch?
 You haven't changed a bit.
 Don't shoot! Only need a refill.
 Feigned indifference. I like it.
 I'm sorry, Jenna. About your sister.
 I Came to the funeral.
 Yeah, I didn't want to push my way in, but I wanted to be there for you. And when I heard you were staying in Mystic Falls, I thought maybe...Well, maybe I could have a second chance to make things right.
 Vodka tonic. Okay, I know that this is probably going to be strike 3, but I hope you can see it for what it is.
 Persistence, groveling, commitment. Take your pick.
 I was young and stupid, and then things changed. Life got...real. You'd know that better than anyone.
 Well, more groveling, of course. A recap of the past few years spent soul searching. Cheese fries.
 I know my audience.
 I can get it.
 They've come back.
 Evening, Sheriff. Anything?
 Then they're staying in town.
 There has to be a private residence.
 Well, someone who only comes out at night should eventually become obvious.
 I'm working on it.
 I can't believe you really came.
 All proceeds are going to the school's athletic department still healing from the tragic death of their football coach William Tanner. The citizens of Mystic Falls coming together in support of one of their own. Cut it.
 Thank you.
 Well, 53% of Americans watch the news with the sound off.
 Do you remember the last time we were in the school parking lot?
 Really?
 That was a good day. What?
 Hi. Elena, right? I think I met you once when you were 9.
 Ouch. Here i thought we were making progress.
 If i do her a favor, will i get back in your good graces?
 Done. Wait. One condition. Dinner, tonight, your house.
 Ooh. What do you need?
 Yeah, at the station. Between the archives and the Internet, we pretty much have everything.
 Heading there now. Let's go.
 We digitized all our archives last year. You can pull all the remote footage right up on screen. What is it exactly you're looking for?
 Sorry, one second. Yeah? Fire? All right, be right there. I gotta go. You believe there's actual news to cover in this town? All right, use keywords to search the database. It's pretty easy to navigate. And Brady down in tech will help you out with anything you need.
 All right? Oh, hey. Could you put in a good word for me with Jenna?
 All right. Good luck.
 Oh, hey, man. Just looking for the bathroom.
 Never smelled one this bad before.
 Are you sure?
 We know who they are?
 What story should i run?
 I got the Gilbert watch.
 You know her?
 Think she's one of these?
 Sorry I'm late.
 That's it?
 Got it.
 Of course I can.
 Have you?
 I think I got something. It's pointing towards the old cemetery.
 
 Aren't you gonna invite me in?
 I missed you. I was out of town. I...
 
 I can explain. Just invite me in and I'll tell you everything.
 Come on, Jenna. It’s me.
 I know you. You’re always one step from a "maybe", a tiny nudge to "yes".
 Evening.
 I took some time off.
 Hey you know something, Daphne?
 I have tons of these wood bullets, so nothing funky.
 That’s what you get.
 
 See I know what you and your brother are. I’ve been watching the two of you. I knew you'd show up here and I'm glad you did, because I have some questions.
 
 You bit me.
 It had to be you.
 Who?
 Dude, it’s not like the welcome wagon was waiting with a bundt cake and a handbook. It’s been a learn as you go process. You know, one minute, I’m a small town on the rise news guy and next thing I know, I can’t get into my house, because my foot won’t go through the door.
 I know. I live alone.
 So now, I am at the Ramada, watching pay per view all day, eating everything in sight, including housekeeping.
 All I can think about is blood and killing people. I can’t stop killing people. I keep killing 
 I left one. I was tired. But I’ve been hiding the rest of bodies. They're right back there.
 They're just piling up!
 Why am I so overly emotional? All I can think about is my ex-girlfriend. I wanna be with her and bite her and stuff.
 What about walking in the sun? I’m a morning person. You can walk in the sun which, by the way, is pretty cool. 
 Yeah, the founding fathers, they passed down journals to their kids. Come on man, you gotta tell me. How can you walk around in the sun?
 How do you walk in the sun?
 You know, I’ve been really nice so far but I will kill you.
 You first!
 I have things to do, people to kill. Guess I'll be needing a little head start.
 Jenna, are you dodging me?
 You know, your brother asked me the same thing. In fact, why don’t we just skip past all that who turned me stuff and get the answer that I want? How can I turn into a day walker?
 But you're both very cagey on the how, which tells me that there is a way. You know, in case you hadn't noticed, I’m quite the celebrity in this town. It would be very, very easy for me to expose you.
 I do.
 Liz.
 What are you gonna do stake me? Bury me in another shallow grave? What would the email say this time?
 
 I was one of you.
 Watch your back, Sheriff.
 Hey, damsel in distress, need a ride?
 I used to baby sit you, Caroline Forbes. Don’t mock me.
 It's not a problem, really. It’s on my way.
 And why is that?
 Anything you want. But first, buckle up.
 Your daughter has expressed an interest in journalism. I think it’s important to foster young minds.
 The satisfaction of turning your daughter into a vampire.
 I told you I don’t know.
 How can you side with them?
 I don’t know!
 Wait, wait! I do know.
 You think you’re the only one who wants to get in that tomb underneath the old church?
 I am not lying. There is another way to break the spell. We can help you. Meet me at the old church.
 Who are you?
 Jenna sent you?
 Ah, I get it. Well, buddy, I know you think this makes you brave. But actually it makes you pretty stupid.
 What do you want?
 Was that supposed to be a threat? Couldn't you throw a punch? Maybe provoke me a little?
 Well, you’re not a very smart one, either.
 'Cause you have no idea who you're talking to.
