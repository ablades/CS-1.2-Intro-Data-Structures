 Hey.
 Oh, I'm Megan. Your roommate.
 So, your current boyfriend, Damian–
 –is your ex's brother.
 You and Stefan are friends, but three months ago he left without saying goodbye?
 No way.
 Do you have a boyfriend, Caroline?
 Same here.
 We'll split up the shelves.
 Okay...sounds good.
 What's going on? Are you okay?
 What happened?
 It's fine. It just sounded like someone was dying out here. Well, I'm glad you're okay!
 Hey! I was wondering if you guys were gonna make it.
 Why are you guys just standing there?
 Right. Well, I'm gonna go hang.
 
 Help me! Oh, my god!
 Elena, please help me!
