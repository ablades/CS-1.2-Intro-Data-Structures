 Yeah, Andie Star. Nice to meet you. Can I buy you a drink, Damon?
 I can't believe you called me. I thought I was being way top forward when I had Jenna give you my number.
 Thank you! So, what do you want Mister tall-dark-and-handsome?
 You can booty-call me anytime you want.
 Oh, tell me about it.
 I knew it. I know how to pick 'em. So, why can't you have her? She's with another man, I assume?
 You don't trust yourself around her?
 Why do you kill people?
 Well, maybe this is who you are now. Love does that Damon, it changes us.
 I'm late. This is such a crazy day. 
 Yeah. It's for some visiting writer. He's writing a book on small-town Virginia. It's a big snooze.
 Uh, Elijah Smith.
 I can't say that you bit me or drank my blood, just that we hit it off and I really like you. You are terrific, though. You're sweet, funny, you're honest.
 You might be the one.
 Oh. Hey, Alaric. Later.
 Hi. You came.
 Hi.
 Ahhh. Wow.
 Kinda do.
 Uh-huh.
 Mmm. My lips are sealed.
 No, you know what? We should continue this. Let's have a dinner party.
 It's good for me. Jenna?
 So what's going on with you and Alaric? I feel like there's some tension.
 Like what?
 Oh. Well, there you go, then. Trust is the key to any relationship. I mean, I am so grateful that Damon tells me everything.
 Hey, Jenna needs help with the wine.
 Thanks.
 What's that?
 Ah, it's too bad. I like him. He's very old-school. Classy.
 Hmm. That is a little too sexist for me.
 Yeah, but there's no tangible proof there were witches in Salem.
 The gentlemen should take their drinks in the study.
 I like you.
 Elijah.
 So...I know this is a social thing, but I...I would really love to ask you some more questions about the work that you're doing here.
 Great, that's so great.
 Ric, would you do me a favor and grab the notebook out of my bag?
 No Ric, it's in the front pocket. On the...you know what? Excuse me, guys. Sorry.
 Okay. My first question is when you got here to Mystic...
 Hey.
 Uh, no.
 Good morning.
 Oh, it's really messy. Can you just use a blood bag today?
 I'm already late for work.
 It's really none of your business, is it, Stefan?
 I have to go to work.
 Hi.
 Where are we going?
 I don't think this is a good idea.
 Alaric, are you home? Andie...Star, Jenna's friend.
 Wow! You were right. She looks exactly like Elena.
 We are here to rescue you.
 Right.
 Nice to meet you.
 Damon, easy.
 You don't have to be so mad at your brother. You know, he's worried about Elena, and...
 I know you're worried about her, too.
 Okay.
 You didn't compel me. I want to be here. Just let me be here.
 No. You need to know that somebody cares about you. I care about you, Damon.
 Huh. No you are out of champagne; I don't drink in the morning.
 I think you can probably get it yourself. I'm not your slave.
 I mean you're dripping a little.
 Huh, that fluttered victim you had me looking into had family in Tennessee.
 Aha.
 See you at the party.
 Yeah, Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Okay, I, I am the last person here again.
 Days of work, please can we do this in the a.m.? I have a party I have to get to, and you gotta get a life! Okay, all right. Bye, bye.
 Hello? Not cool. My retinas are burning.
 Okay, Okay. Seriously who'd...? What the hell are you doing?
 Hello? Hello?
 Ohh! Stefan!? Oh my god! Oh my god, what are you doing here? We have been looking everywhere for you! Stefan?
 Damon? I can't move Damon. He told me that I can't move.
