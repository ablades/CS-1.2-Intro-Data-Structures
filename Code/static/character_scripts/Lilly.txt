 Loyalty is never a chore, Lorenzo. At any rate, it's ill-bred to speak of such personal matters. I do hope you're hungry. It... It appears my lunch date has stood me up... Bonnie Bennett. You see, my traveling companions remain trapped in that prison world. Miss Bennett has offered to get them out.
 Is it with you?
 Hello again, Bonnie.
 He did, but prisons are easily escaped  you of all people should know that.
 Must I constantly repeat myself? If you don't know what I want by now...
 Isn't there? What's that term you witches are so fond of? "Loophole?"
 Oh, you've made your position quite clear. Apparently I failed to do the same, because you seem to think that I'm here for your help. I'm not.
 Hmm. Those are lovely words, Bonnie. Here's another one... die.
 Now...
 Where were we?
 I want my family back. That's all I've ever wanted, to have my family back, with me, where they belong.
 Tea, please  Earl Grey.
 I heard you tried to bring me something called an, uh, MP3 player? I'm not entirely sure what that is, but still, I wanted to thank you.
 Of course not, but I'm resourceful.
 Actually, no, you shouldn't. I was a Ripper because I lost my family, but today I'm getting them back.
 This can't be it. No one's here.
 They're not the ones who gave me the address.
