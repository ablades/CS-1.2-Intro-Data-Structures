 Can I help you?
 That's me.
 Jamie? Whose car's out front?
 Hello, Bonnie.
 So I hope you guys are hungry, cause...food has always been my go-to ice-breaker.
 You're so sweet. Just like your mom.
 Miranda was my best friend.
 My best friend is why I left. Fifteen years ago a vampire came to town. Looking for you, Elena. Looking for the doppelg√§nger. No one could manage to kill him. So I lured him out of town and cast a spell to desiccate him in a crypt in Charlotte.
 It took every ounce of power I had. Almost killed me. I recovered. But my magic didn't. My powers never came back.
 It wasn't that simple.
 Bonnie, wait, please. Don't go. Talk to me...Please?
 You've grown into such a beautiful young woman, Bonnie.
 I had no magic. I was in a new city and I realized I had a chance to be somebody else. To be Abby Wilson, the woman...not Abby Bennett, the witch. I'm not proud of what I did, Bonnie. I ran. I know I ran. But you had your dad and your Grams, and, let's face it, your Grams is ways better at this stuff then I am.
 What?...How?
 Well she raised you right. I'm sure, she would've been proud of you...Well, now you know my whole story.
 How's about you tell me yours? What brings you to me?
 Not spells, no. But...I'm not completely useless. I mean, the earth still provides herbs and such. There might be something I can do.
 Bonnie. Please. Let me help you.
 Jamie!
 She didn't tell me where the coffins are. The vampire showed up.
 He did. But she's not gonna talk now. There's no way. I tried.
 You'll be fine. But don't try any spells. Those herbs I used muted your magic.
 She'll be fine too. Bonnie, listen to me. I need your help. I need you to tell me where those coffins are.
 Because if you don't, that man compelled Jamie to kill himself.
 All you need to do, is tell me where they are. Then we'll have held up our end of the bargain. Bonnie, please.
 You think the hybrid will come back?
 He is my family, Bonnie. I know, that might be hard for you to hear, but he is. But that doesn't mean that I don't care about you. I wanna help you.
 When I put Mikael down...my magic didn't just leave me. It drifted away. The longer I stayed away from you the weaker it gone. I think, that nature was punishing me for abandoning you. Maybe you can help me get my magic back.
 I don't. But if it's what you wanted...I would do that for you.
 Slow down!
 That's the one that's sealed?
 Aren't you coming inside?
 This is a bad idea.
 I told you, I don't have any powers.
 It was the only one I needed. So...what is all of this?
 The one you're trying to kill with whatever is in that coffin?
 It's the spell I used to seal Mikael in the tomb. I burned it and tried to get it out of my head. Didn't work though. Wait...Do you see this?
 No. Right here. On this side. It's a blood knot. It means to bind it you need two generations. A bloodline. Like...two keys to a safety deposit box.
 The spirits are angry with me. For leaving you. Maybe they didn't want me to have my powers again.
 There is no way I can tell you how sorry I am for what I did.
 Okay.
 Who's the creepy, lurky guy?
 Wonder what your Grams thinks about the part we're playing in all of this balance of nature stuff.
 Why exactly did you invite us here?
 
 This place has some serious vibe in it.
 I can't feel it any more. My garden, it's gone. I can't feel anything.
 Jamie.
 I almost killed him!
 No, no! I should just go before I hurt Jamie again or you!
 Thank you.
 I have to. I don't know how to do this.
 She's better off without me.
 Tell them I'm sorry.
 Hello Bonnie.
 Jamie's worried about you. He said it was urgent. I just didn't think you'd ever want to see me again.
 Why didn't I have to be invited in?
 Bonnie, it's too dangerous. Your magic comes from the Earth. It's pure. This spell asks you to tap into dark places. Places of temptation, places you can't handle.
 The spell allows you to stop a vampire's heart. The blood will stop flowing and his body will desiccate.
 To stop a vampire's heart, you need to find a balance among the living. Can you handle that?
 No one's going anywhere.
 Your father called. Who's professor Shane? What has he been teaching you?
 My daughter is done helping Elena Gilbert. Now, get out!
 Answer my question. What lies has this professor been telling you?
 It's not just your father, Bonnie. Witches talk; word gets around.
 I have warned you about dark magic before.
 I'm not the one that needs to be saved. You are.
 Just enough to keep her down until I can get some witches here to clean her mind from that poison that professor's been teaching her.
 Bonnie, please.
 Bonnie. Caroline called me. She told me what happened. I'm sorry. She said you didn't want to talk to her, and... she's hoping maybe you'll... talk to me?
 It's time. We have to return Enzo to the earth. We have to say good-bye.
 Oh. No, honey. You're grieving.
 The Other Side is gone. And neither of us have our magic anymore. It's best not to mess with such things.
 Enzo, we call on you. One who loves you is reaching out to you. If you are among us, please give us a sign. ENZO, if you are there, we are here to listen. 
 Oh, you were right. This is not grief. This is something different. I saw the moment of Enzo's death. I felt his pain. I don't know how that's possible without magic. You must have opened a door.
 To wherever Enzo is. Somewhere dark. Filled with suffering and emptiness.
 I don't know, but we need to close that door. We need to bury him.
 No. Whatever darkness you reached into is reaching back for you.
 Bonnie!
 Bonnie, stay with me. Please, Bonnie. No! 
 Bonnie! I had to! I had to, baby. I had to destroy every part of him. It was the only way to break the connection...
 No, Bonnie. He didn't open that door, you did. I have failed you in so many ways as a mother. But I will not let you destroy yourself.
 And he wouldn't want to drag you in with him. You know that. He loved you. He wouldn't want you to suffer. You got to let him go. Okay, baby? You got to let him go. You got to say good-bye.
