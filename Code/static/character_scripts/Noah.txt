 Hey. It's gonna be $22. 
 Thanks. And you have yourself a good night.
 Hello, Elena.
 You hit me with your car.
 Is that a new one?
 You got away from me. You won't next time
 What are you doing here?
 I like her. She looks like Katherine.
 I know, but until we open that tomb, I got her to play with.
 They don't scare me. They never have.
 You got nothing to worry about. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. You will get what you came for. Just let me have my fun. 
 Hello, Elena. 
 Or your brother dies.
 I can snap his neck so fast I bet there's not even a witness. Now, start walking.
 Keep walking. Through the door.
 Screw you.
 Because it's fun.
 She looks like Katherine.
 Oh. You thought you were the only ones. 
 No.
 The grimoire.
 Check the journal. The journal. Johnathan's journal. Johnathan Gilbert's.
 No. You're gonna have to kill me.
