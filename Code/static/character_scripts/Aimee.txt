 Thanks. You know, you're missing all the fun in the water.
 Too bad. So, there's a full moon tonight. We're gonna light a fire later and tells ghost stories.
 Hi Caroline.
 Really Tyler? You dragged me all the way out here?
 Where are we going?
 Are you sure?
 What is this place?
 Is everyone else coming?
 You're single, right?
 Let's go.
 Wait, wait. No, I'm sorry.
 No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, I can't. I'm not into it.
 I don't know but I'm not even sure why I was flirting with you. I like Matt.
 Iâ€˜m gonna go.
 Sorry.
 Why, are you okay?
 I'm...I'm okay, I'm just worried about you.
 We were just talking.
 Yeah.
 Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...I'm just gonna go.
 Oh no, stay away, that guy's damaged goods.
 Hey, thanks for the text. Where too?
 Margaritas?
 Let's do it.
 Where is mine?
 Thanks for having us over. I think Sarah's got a thing for Jeremy.
 Look, I'm really embarrassed about slutting it up with you that day at the swimming hole. I'm really not like that, I promise you.
 Friends?
 I want to see.
 Hey, you guys are missing all the drinking.
 Pretty.
 Well, come and get it.
 Sarah, don't be a bad drunk.
 Sarah, oh my god!
 She's not moving. Oh my god.
 Oh my god.
 Hey, I want a shot.
 Yes.
 Okay, let's go party. Come on.
 Hey Stefan, I can't find Matt. Oh my god Elena! You look so pretty. I love that dress. You look gorge.
 Oh, thanks.
