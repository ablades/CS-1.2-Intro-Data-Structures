 Trevor! Control yourself.
 Oh my god, you look just like her.
 Be quiet!
 I know who you are, I said be quiet.
 I want you to be quiet.
 How's the girl?
 You didn't touch her, did you?
 No, I called one of his contacts. You know how this works.
 They say he got it.
 So that's it Trevor. He either got it or he didn't. We just have to wait.
 I'm sick of running!
 Elijah's old school. If he accepts our deal, we're free.
 You! There's nothing around here for miles. If you think you're getting out of this house, you're tragically wrong. Understand?
 He's your worst nightmare.
 You keep asking me these questions like I'm gonna answer them.
 That's another one.
 I personally want nothing; I'm just a delivery service.
 Two points to the eavesdropper.
 He's one of the vampires, the originals.
 Again with the questions. Haven't the Salvatores been teaching you your vampire history?
 I know of them. A hundred years back, a friend of mine tried to set me up with Stefan. She said he was one of the good ones. I'm more of a sucker for the bad boys though but I digress.
 Trevor and I have been running for 500 years. We're tired, we want it over. We're using you to negotiate ourselves out of an old mess.
 Because you're a Petrova Doppelgänger. You're the key to breaking the curse.
 Oh, you do know your history.
 No, the moonstone is what binds the curse. The sacrifice is what breaks it.
 The blood of the doppelgänger. You're the doppelgänger. Which means, in order to break the curse you're the one who has to die.
 Mm-hmm.
 He made the same mistake countless others did  he trusted Katerina Petrova.
 The one and only, the first Petrova Doppelgänger.
 Which is why we're not gonna make the same mistake again.
 No, I told you I would get us out of this. You have to trust me.
 He wants her more.
 Hey! What are we?
 Stay here with her and don't make a sound.
 Yes, in here. You have to forgive the house.
 I wanted my freedom. I'm tired of running. You in a position to grant me that?
 Katerina Petrova?
 She didn't burn in the church in 1864.
 She survived.
 You don't seem surprised by this.
 No, but I have better. I have her doppelgänger.
 The facts are wrong.
 Elijah, you are a man of honor, you should be trusted but I want to hear you say it again.
 Follow me.
 You...!
 It's the first I've heard of it.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know who it is.
 I'm not here to hurt you.
 Lexi once told me that you're one of the good ones.
 Trevor was my best friend. For 500 years I have lived with one person and he's gone and I don't want to run anymore because I don't have anywhere else to run to.
 I don't need your help but I think you need mine. Elijah may be dead but this isn't over.
 It isn't over. The originals, they'll come for her. They have to. They're doing it for him.
 Klaus.
 Okay, you have to understand I only know what I've picked up over the years and I don't know what's true and what's not true. It's the problem with all this vampire crap but Klaus, I know he's real.
 No. Elijah was the Easter bunny compared to Klaus. He's a foot soldier. Klaus is the real deal.
 Yes.
 Which it is.
 Which I'm not.
 Not that you know of.
 He's real and he doesn't give up. If he wants something, he gets it. If you're not afraid of Klaus, then you're an idiot.
 You've always been this sensitive?
 Yeah, you switch yours, I'll switch mine.
 It's an observation. Being in love with your brother's girlfriend must be difficult.
 You want to try that again?
 Then show me your good side.
 You don't find Klaus, he finds you.
 Add another two hundred somebodies to that and you're still not even close.
 Through a very low somebody on the totem pole. A guy named Slater in Richmond.
 No. You forget not all of us can do sun.
 Damn him. Always making promises I don't want to keep.
 Let the girl in.
 Bring her water and something to eat.
 You stole this from Klaus?
 People do not escape from Klaus. Everyone who tries ends up back in his grasp and anyone who helps them dies.
 I'm risking nothing. At nightfall, I'll bring you back to Klaus and beg him to show us both mercy.
 That's the point. We can't all have little daylight rings.
 I called him. He's here. He's always here.
 I'm older than you and stronger. Don't get on my bad side.
 You can trust me.
 Double paned and tempered. UV rays can't penetrate. You see the appeal now?
 Hey, how are you?
 Mmm, it's a long story but I want you to meet...
 Yes. It was right. Thank you for the tip.
 It's nightfall. Time to go.
 When did this happen?
 It's a lie, I would have smelled it.
 If you die then Trevor dies with you.
 You have set us both on the path of death. I only hope Klaus sees the honor in returning that girl to him.
 Then so be it!
 He'll kill you. He won't stop until he has all of our heads.
 Do you not see, Trevor? She used you to help her escape and me to turn her. Klaus will see our role in this.
 As am I....for this.
 You have just signed our death sentence.
 Slater's been in college since '74.
 We need your help. If someone wanted to get in touch with Klaus, how would you hook him up?
 But werewolves are extinct.
 I know.
 I don't know. Where is Slater?
 He's not behind this, he's a good guy, he wouldn't betray me.
 It's Klaus, don't you understand? You don't know this man, we're dead, we're all dead.
 I'm sorry about today. I didn't know that was gonna happen.
 I wish we could save Elena. I know that you want to.
 You remind me of Trevor.
 Because he always talked a big game, he was always working on an angle but underneath it all, he was the best friend anyone could hope for.
 Dead and my loyalty to him almost got me dead too.
 You're right to fight it, the way you feel about her.
 Because if you want to survive, you need to not care about anyone.
 It might just be time to turn the switch off on your emotions.
 It's a lie, you know. There's no switch you can turn off. Sure when you're a newbie but after a couple of hundred years...you just have to pretend.
 Hello?
 Slater? Are you okay?
 No, I'm sorry to involved you.
 Okay, what did you find?
 How? What do you mean? I don't follow.
 Yes, he can get it. What next?
 It's not nice to leave a girl naked so early in the morning.
 Whoa. Sorry, I thought you were...
 There's no one else here.
 Then I should probably get dressed.
 It's a bad idea.
 Because somebody blew up a coffee shop with us in it.
 Why are you coming to me with this?
 Or maybe it's because you know that they wouldn't want you doing this. And their moonstone caper gives you a chance to sneak away.
 They're just trying to protect you.
 What exactly do you hope to achieve by this?
 I've been a slave to shadows for 500 years, what do you think?
 Slater? Slater, it's Rose. Open up!
 He's not home. Sorry.
 After you.
 Slater?
 I don't think he's gonna be much help.
 Yeah, probably to stop him from helping people like us. The guy was a vampire almanac. Knowing too much information just bit him in the ass.
 Tempered glass. U.V. rays can't penetrate.
 I used to just come here and watch the day.
 Any luck?
 No, this is fine. Let's just go.
 Stay here.
 Alice?
 She found him a few minutes before we did.
 Overreacting. Big time.
 Those tears are for her. She didn't care about Slater. 
 Yeah, probably whoever killed him.
 
 What about that one? Cody Webber. They exchanged dozens of emails about Elijah.
 What?!
 What are you doing?
 If Klaus knows that you're alive, he'll find you and he'll kill you.
 Which is exactly what you wanted all along.
 So this whole charade is some suicide mission so that you could sacrifice yourself and save everyone else?
 Don't be angry with me.
 You need to get to Richmond immediately.
 I'm sorry, Elena.
 You don't answer your phone.
 I wanted to apologize.
 I'm sorry about Elena. I wasn't thinking straight. I didn't know that she had a death wish but I called you, I tried to make it right, okay? I'm sorry, Damon. And I have nowhere else to go.
 Well, then...
 It hurts.
 Oh my God, I thought a werewolf bite was fatal! I thought...
 So it was Jules. The other werewolf, the one who attacked you.
 All's well that ends well.
 Yeah. Seems that way.
 Lucky me.
 I'm gonna stay and help you.
 Save Elena, protect Elena, all things Elena.
 Because I like you. I believe in friendship. I happen to have a vacancy in that department, and you can use all the friends you can get.
 Just friends.
 I don't love men who love other women. I think more of myself than that, but that doesn't mean I can't be your special friend.
 Ow.
 I was born in 1450, that makes me 560 years old.
 So I can die. I've lived long enough.
 Just a little, fatal to a vampire werewolf bite.
 Yeah, it does feel like it's working.
 How is it?
 It's not necessary.
 I hate this. I'm a vampire, I haven't had a cold in five centuries.
 We don't get sick. When we die, it's fast and sudden and it's certainly not drawn out in illness.
 Such a human thing to say.
 You've never been in Damon's room before, have you?
 Not what you expected?
 You're lucky, you know. No one's ever love me the way you're loved.
 Trevor was my best friend. Nothing more. I spent all those years on the run from Elijah. I just never thought it was a good idea to set up roots. The whole idea of family is not exactly compatible with being a vampire. Why are you so eager to give up?
 What do you call this whole deal with Elijah?
 It's your easiest option.
 Do you really think that your witch friend destroyed the moonstone?
 You really are determined to die, aren't you? At least I ran, you're not even trying.
 I'm so tired.
 No, stop, wait. Tell them to prepare the horses.
 Trevor, don't be so stupid. You're never going to make it there before the sun.
 Elena, Elena, I need more blood.
 It's all your fault, Katerina. You Katerina, you did this.
 You betrayed us!
 Elena?
 Oh my god Elena. I'm so sorry. I don't know what's happening to me. I'm sorry.
 My mind, I'm...
 I'm sorry, don't be scared of me.
 I'm scared.
 Here, where's here?
 I want to go home.
 St. Austell, thirty kilometers south of London. With fields and trees and horses.
 When you live long enough, everything disappears. So much time wasted, I just wish I wouldn't have been so afraid.
 Katerina.
 Elena? I know that's you and not Katherine. Elena? Please, I need your help.
 Did I do this? I never meant to hurt anyone. I never wanted to hurt anyone.
 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
 No, I don't have a home, I haven't had a home in so long.
 Oh make it stop, please make it stop! I hate it, make it stop!
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry, Elena. I don't like taking human life, I never have.
 It's the worst part about it  the hunt, the need to kill, the thirst, the pleasure it brings you afterwards. I wasn't meant to be evil. It hurts.
 Damon's a lot like me. He wants to care but when he does he runs away from it. I'm sorry for what I've done today.
 And you need to fight. I know that you're scared but you have to do it anyway.
 Why are you so nice to me?
 You can never forget it, what it's like to be human. It haunts me. It's the only thing that's kept me going. It doesn't hurt as much anymore.
 Oh god! Make it stop, make it stop! I can't take it anymore, make it stop!
 Who would have thought you'd be a nice guy?
 You're lying.
 This was my favorite place to come as a girl. How did you know?
 Am I dreaming?
 The sun is so warm. I miss this. I miss being human.
 I had friends, I had a family, I mattered.
 No but you do. You built a life whether you want to admit it or not. I spent 500 years just existing.
 There's always a choice.
 I'd like to enjoy the fresh air. Would you enjoy it with me?
 Thank you.
 The pain's gone.
 Will I see them again? My family?
 That would be nice. Maybe I'll see Trevor too. I'm not afraid anymore.
 I'll race you to the trees.
 I'm older and faster.
 On the count of three. One, two...
 No. I enjoy it. I was running so much when I was alive, now I have the freedom to do whatever I want.
 Tell him he's still dripping with sex too. 
 And tell him I'm rooting for him and Elena.
 Unfortunately, I don't have any news on the siring front. Klaus didn't sire me. No Original did. It was Mary Porter.
 I didn't keep track of her when I was alive, much less now. Tell them to sit tight, relax. I'll see what I can find out.
 Are we there yet? Don't tell them I'm here. They had a fight. I know you want to stop it. Protect her from him. But you're young, you don't see what I see. It's not just that she makes him a better person, she does, but he changes her too. Damon challenges her, surprises her, he makes her question her life, beliefs. Stefan is different, his love is pure, he'll always be good for her. Damon is either the best thing for her or the worst.
