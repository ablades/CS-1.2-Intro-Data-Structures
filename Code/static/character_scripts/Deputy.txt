 What was that?
 Sheriff, over here.
 Damon Salvatore was just spotted outside entering The Grill.
 Sir? 
 Yeah, you wanted to be notified if there was any activity over at the Salvatore house. Seem to be some squatters tonight. Do you want me to go over there and...?
 Hey, sheriff.
 I hope civilian life treats you better than that girl in the alley.
 Violet Fell. She was a contestant in the Miss Mystic Falls Pageant yesterday.
 Halfway to Duluth, Jenkins turn in his badge this morning. Didn't think a small town like this came with so many homicides.
