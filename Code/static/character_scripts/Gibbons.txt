 Any friend of Pearl's is a friend of mine. Please do. Come in.
 Did you get enough sweetheart?
 Anna, are you hungry? Did you want a little?
 Of course I am. I'm fine.
 Yes, Frederick, honey?
 I'll never let him in.
 Oh, sure, honey. It's right there.
 What's happening?
 Oh, I'm sorry. He's not allowed in the house.
 No.
 No. It's just me.
