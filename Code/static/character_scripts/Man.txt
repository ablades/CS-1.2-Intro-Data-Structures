 Hear what?
 There's no thunder.
 It's not gonna rain. Listen, I...got you a little something. It's back in the car. Don't you move.
 It's not gonna rain.
 I know you. My God.
 I know you. How can it be?
 You haven't aged a day.
 Well, I...I thought it was somebody I knew.
 Nah, it can't be. It's just my mind playing tricks on me.
 When I first moved here, I stayed at the Salvatore boarding house.
 Stefan was just passing through to visit his uncle. I mean, none of us knew he was even here until the attack.
 His uncle got killed. Mauled by an animal in the woods.
 Mm-mmm. Joseph.
 Oh, how could you? I mean, this happened years ago.
 Ah.
 Yes. I remember his ring and his brother 
 Yeah. Stefan and Damon Salvatore.
 It was early June, 1953. Yeah. June, 1953.
 1953.
 See you, bro!
 What are you doing out here in the middle of the night? It's not safe.
 Make sure the two of you stick together!
 Go and check those woods over there!
 Johnathan, this way!
 Jeez! You scared me.
 Saturday.
 It's 2010. Are you OK?
 Wait, what's your name?
 How did you get out here? And why are you dressed like that?
 Sorry for what?
 Thank you for the text.
 Good.
 That won't be a problem. She won't get any closer to the truth.
 Yes. You're done.
 I'm not a vampire, so, yes, I can.
 And now I have to do mine.
 Yeah, I'm a plumber.
 I have a message for you.
 Stop looking.
 She doesn't want to know you. She doesn't want to talk to you.
 You need to stop looking. Do you understand?
 Do you understand?
 Good.
 I'm done now.
 Wow! Watch it!
 Then get off the dance floor.
 Whatever.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm really, really sorry.
 Sorry about that man. I really am terribly sorry.
 I'm sorry about that too. All I can do is apologize. What's that about?
 No girl to show off for now? I see what how this is.
 What are you, man?
 My arm. I lost my balance and fell. I'm clumsy.
 We have to get to the church. They're waiting.
 In the trunk, I did exactly what you said.
 Is there anything else?
 Excuse me, are you okay?
 What's up Ray?
 Where the hell's my wife?
 You think you're so tough? Hiding in your bar, drinking your liquor? A telephone call to Chicago P.D. might set you straight.
 Oh, thank God. Come on, we're leaving.
 What the hell are you doing?
 What kind of sick freaks are you?
 Go to hell.
 Liam. Liam Grant.
 What are you doing? You're gonna ruin your career.
 Who are you?
 I'm a convicted murderer.
 Of course I am.
 Only that I got caught.
 I told you.
 Yeah? I'm glad you liked it.
 Do it again next weekend?
 I don't know. 
 Oh my god.
 
 What happened to your hair?
 In the last two minutes?
 Are you feeling okay, Miss Pierce?
 Marcel said we're your guides.
 You're doing magic?
 Don't make this a thing, Sophie. The hybrid was looking for Jane-Anne  Marcel wants to know why.
 Dude, are you like, okay?
 Or the two thousand years part.
 No, thanks.
 What was that?
 I'm a what?
 Wait.. I drink blood now?
 She's gone... she left me years ago.
 Pharmacist.
 Maria, we're on the move.
 You scared me. (But he's smiling.)
 Erase what? What the hell are you doing to me?
 Help.
 Don't forget the...
 
 Damon...
 Help! Help...
 Well, he was, until you called and told him to forget it.
 Are you Damon Salvatore?
 Well, that's who called.
 Started out in sales, moved up the ladder, next thing you know, I'm in charge of the whole darn operation. The ironic thing is, I'm a pacifist. I just happen to make steel-press machinery.
 No. Some of our machines can be used to make parts for guns, if the client so chooses.
 Oh, no. Nothing harmful. Hmm.
 Well, a gun's not much good without a working trigger.
 The magazine, right.
 I'm merely an ancillary supplier following a corporate mandate.
 Tell me about it. Ask my wife.
 Why bring sand to the beach? Huh? Kidding.
 Hey! Are you part of my Uber pool? Oh my God, youâ€™re...
