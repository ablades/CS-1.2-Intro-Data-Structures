 Hey, you folks have the wrong... Holy !
 Damon Salvatore!
 Of course I know you! It's good to see you're well, old friend. Come here, man!
 Haha! Come in, come in!
 Uh, you caught me in the middle of a seventy-two hour social gathering...
 Ahhh... Make yourself at home!
 Uh, friend with the vervain gun? If you could holster that, I sure would feel a lot more comfortable.
 
 Nothing?
 Heh, right, right, right. Uh, well, your mom was going through a rough patch. She could not move on until she knew her boys were okay, so she sent me out to find you.
 
 All emotions are valid and welcome here. But, it's the truth. She just wanted to know you were happy, Damon. She loved you.
 Hey, you guys, what can I get you? Cocktail? Joint?
 Jenny?
 Hey, hey, hey! Shhhh! Hahahahaha!
 
 You know you can get a drink served to you in a fishbowl here? Hahaha!
 Oh, hey! The other day, I called a number on this card, and just like that, I had a girlfriend!
 But she really got who I am, you know?
 It was a beautiful human experience! And that's what I've discovered here... freedom. The bad trip inside that prison world has ended, my friends, and I am breathing in what my soul was craving  f-r-e-e-dom.
 
 
 
 Okay, then.
 Come on.
 Ready?
 Where's the Phoenix Stone?
 
 
 Yeah, you had the same opinion back then. Hated everything your side believed in. Hey, you wanted to desert, but feared shaming your old man.
 
 You know what? A little extra piece of advice  A lot of people want the Phoenix Stone. Mess with it, and you end up dead.
 
 
 AHHH!
 
 
 
 Can you keep a secret?
 I found him months ago.
 I didn't tell anyone. I wanted to... live a little before I came back.
 
 Hmmm. Yeah, that's a... That's a pretty good idea. Yeah. Yeah, I'll probably do that.
 AHHHHHH!
 
 
 
 
 I'm gonna need more.
 
 I just need a little more, okay? Just... Just a taste. A drop.
 Well, then you're gonna have to stop this thing!!
 
 I think I'm still hungry.
 What stone? Why do people keep asking me questions I don't know the answer to?
 
 I'm not going back in there!
 No! I'm not going back!
 Why does everyone keep calling me Oscar? My name's not Oscar!
 Did I do that?
 
 Give me the stone!
