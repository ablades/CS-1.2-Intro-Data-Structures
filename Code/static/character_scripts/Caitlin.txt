 
 Hello, Atty.
 You're bleeding.
 No. It's good. It's okay. It's what's keeping me here.
 Sweetheart, it's okay. You wanted Sam back as much as I did. What if you had a second chance to bring us both back?
 We have a witch. His name is Silas. If you set him free, he'll help those who have helped him.
 He's entombed in the caves below us, but it's impossible to get him out without a spell. You need to get the spell.
 It isn't like that. You're merely leading these people so Silas can bring them back from the dead.
 The spell that brings me back requires a witch to channel an extreme amount of mystical energy. Energy that doesn't occur in nature.
 
 Because you believe it is possible. You believe that you can see me again. You don't have to take a single human life yourself, Atticus. All you have to do is convince someone to believe that it is possible that they can see a lost loved one again. And they'll do it for you. 
 No. You didn't.
