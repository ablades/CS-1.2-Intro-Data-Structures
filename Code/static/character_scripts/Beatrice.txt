 Mr. Maxwell, you are a true artist.
 My mother was glad to receive your letter announcing the bell's completion. But not as glad as I was to decipher the information you had so cleverly hidden within. "Your courage will save us all."
 Have there been more attacks?
 By this time tomorrow, the ringing of your bell will drive those depraved beasts from our lands.
 What did that woman want?
 But we tell each other everything.
 I see.
 "The bell has been corrupted." "The twelfth ring will bring hellfire." No! 
 The bell has been corrupted! It will destroy us all! 
 Averte oculos tuos a quo exitus. Hunc exitus ab auribos.
 No. We cannot allow the devil to walk the Earth.
 Motus!
 Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moveo. Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moveo.
