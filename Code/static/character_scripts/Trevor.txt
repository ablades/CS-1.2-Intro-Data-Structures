 Where is she?
 Good, put her in the back.
 Thank you for your help.
 One more thing. Come closer, please.
 Closer.
 Ssh.
 I know. Just a taste.
 Buzzkill.
 Still passed out.
 Give me some credit. So, you called him?
 Did you or did you not get the message to Elijah?
 Wonderful and what?
 Look, it's not too late. We can leave it here. We don't have to go through with this.
 Yeah? Well, running keeps us from dying.
 Captivity has made her pushy, eh? What do you want to know doppelicious?
 The originals.
 The first family, the old world. Rose and I pissed them off.
 Correction, I pissed them off, Rose had my back and for over half a millennium, they wanted us dead.
 I helped her escape her fate and now I've, sorry, we've been marked ever since.
 He's here! This was a mistake.
 No! He wants me dead, Rose!
 I can't do this. You give her to him, he'll have mercy on you but I need to get out of here.
 We're family, forever.
 I've waited so long for this day, Elijah. I'm truly, very sorry.
 Yes, yes it is. You trusted me with Katerina and I failed you.
 I beg your forgiveness.
 This way. There is more blood over there.
 Head east. I can't lead them astray anymore.
 Never mind. There's a cottage. You'll be safe there. Go now. Go!
 Where is she?
 He will sacrifice her.
 I love her, Rose.
 Then we shall run until we die.
 What did you do, Katerina? I would have helped you live.
 It was enough for me.
 I could not miss the birthday celebration.
 Right this way.
 My dear.
 Katerina, may I introduce the lord Elijah.
