 Hi, here are your drinks.
 Mayor Lockwood, we have your table ready.
 Hi.
 You got it.
 
 Love the hair, by the way. Bold Choice.
 You bet. And that comes with a side of fries or skins.
 Sorry, we're closed, and...
 I don't think so.
 Honey, hate to say this, but you've wasted a trip.
 I don't care who you are. Klaus Mikaelson is gone.
 I mean, no one has seen or heard from that man in...
 Three years.
 Okay, there you go. Need a refill?
 Order up!
 Let me top that off for ya.
