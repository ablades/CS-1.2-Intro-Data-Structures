 Thanks, Vick.
 Please tell me you're not hooking up with my sister.
 You're such a dick.
 How's Elena doing?
 Has she said anything about me?
 I feel weird calling her. She broke up with me.
 More time, huh?
 Hey, I'm Matt, nice to meet you.
 Hey.
 It's okay, Mr. Tanner, I'm cool with it.
 Looking for someone?
 When you broke up with me, you said it was because you needed some time alone. You don't look so alone to me.
 That's okay, Elena. You do what you have to do. I just want to let you know that...I still believe in us. And I'm not giving up on that.
 Vicki? Vicki, what the hell?!
 Somebody, call an ambulance!
 Vicki, Vicki, come on, open your eyes, look at me.
 Vicki...Hey. Hey, it's okay. You're gonna be okay.
 Hey, don't try to talk, okay? You're fine.
 They're keeping her overnight to make sure there's no infection, but she should be able to come home tomorrow.
 Yeah.
 Called and left a message. She's in Virginia Beach with her boyfriend, so...we'll see how long it takes her to come rushing home.
 I know, and now there's talk of some missing campers.
 She said it was a vampire.
 Yeah, she wakes up last night and mutters "vampire" and then passes out.
 I think she was drunk. So what's up with you and the new guy?
 You know, I'm...I'm actually gonna go back to the hospital. I want to be there when Vicki wakes up, get the real story about last night.
 Whoa! Vick. Vicki, hey. Vick, it's Matt. Hey, what's wrong?
 Nurse!
 Nurse! I need help! It's my sister.
 What the...
 Hey. How are you feeling? You look better. I was worried before. You really had me freaked out with all that screaming.
 You don't remember?
 Good, good. Doctor said you could come home tomorrow. Vick, what attacked you in the woods?
 I...I'm gonna...I'm gonna go grab a coffee. Hey, Jer.
 Hey.
 You're welcome.
 What the hell is he talking about, Ty?
 You know what, how about all of you shut up and help me find my sister?
 I'll check the square.
 Hey.
 Have you seen my sister?
 I can't find her. She's missing.
 Hey. I saw you at the hospital yesterday.
 What were you doing there?
 Visiting? You know, Elena and I, we've known each other for a long time. We might not be together right now, but I look out for her. And I'll always look out for her.
 She said you found her wandering around.
 So, um, thanks.
 You're a dick.
 Gnomes.
 Hey, what am I supposed to do, Ty? She made her choice.
 What are you doing? Ty, don't. Ty, don't! Ty!
 Nice job! Nice job!
 First my girlfriend, now my team?
 Blue 80! Blue 80! Set, hut! Go! Come on, Tyler, cover it! Let's do it.
 Line up!
 I hate to say it, but he's got skills.
 Really?
 All right, let's huddle up. Set, hut!
 Hey. That was my bad.
 Yeah.
 She's my sister and I love her, but sometimes she can really make you work for it.
 Ty, don't!
 What are you doin', Vick?
 Tyler, knock it off! Stop!
 Come on, man. Come on.
 You gonna be able to play?
 Uh, what you did back there...you had Jeremy's back.
 I know. This week at practice I was a dick.
 No excuse. Good luck tonight. We're lucky to have you.
 Don't talk to me right now, all right? I'm pissed at you.
 What's my...You're my problem, all right? You're a bully. A freakin' 12-year-old bully, man. And I'm sick of it. I mean, what was that about tonight? What's beating up the new guy going to prove? Or screwing with my sister or pummeling my girlfriend's kid brother.
 This was over the line. Even for you.
 Somebody help!
 Nope. If you want to kill some time, um, you can rack. Come on. We haven't played in forever. I'll let you break.
 Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. Your brother and my sister, that's weird.
 How late is he?
 Good. I mean, it's not like we were ever best friends or anything.
 Why? what's he done?
 Like what? Like that he's a serial killer and he keeps a clown suit in his trunk?
 He's great at football. A little bit of a loner. And as much as I hate saying it, he might be a nice guy.
 I think you should talk to him.
 Ok. You two have fun.
 I'm just observing.
 Wet and wild, Tik.
 No, not for a while.
 Not sure.
 Hey. I'm not saying this for you. I'm saying it for her. But she's big on trust. So whatever you're holding back from her, the more you try to hide it, the more she won't stop till she figures it out.
 She said it was a vampire.
 Where is she?
 What's she on?
 Hey, Vic. How you doin'?
 Ok, where's it hurt?
 Ok, well...
 Come on, Vic. Don't be like that. Let's get you home.
 What happened, Vic?
 I'm calling the cops.
 Jer, are you ok ?
 Damn, Vick.
 She's really messed up.
 Vick. Vicki!
 I'm gonna go look for her. Call me if you hear anything.
 Yeah?
 Vicki, where are you? Are you okay?
 Tell me where you are, and I'll come get you.
 Hey!
 She just called. She's okay.
 Little bit. Yeah.
 I appreciate it.
 Vicki? Is that you?
 Get in here.
 Please come inside. I've been worried. Thank God you're okay. Where were you, Vic?
 Three people were murdered in the woods. The cops were lookin' for you. They wanna question you.
 Everyone was worried about you.
 Are you kidding? I had a freakin' search party out lookin' for you while you were off on your crazy drug trip, and you want me to let it go?
 You think?
 Stefan, what are you doing here?
 Yeah.
 Did he do something to you?
 Look, I don't know what's going on but I think you should leave now.
 Please, now, Stefan.
 You went with last year's costume too, huh?
 Me neither. And you're going as...you?
 Yeah, I got into it with Vic too, when she got home. I'm trying not to smother her tonight, but part of me didn't wanna let her out of my sight.
 Yeah, you can't miss her. She's a vampire.
 Elena what's the matter?
 What's goin' on?
 You need to back off, man.
 No, it's not okay. What the hell is your problem?
 Elena! Hey, have you seen...Whoa. wh...what happened?
 I...I can't find Vicki. She totally bailed on me.
 Is this what I'm in for, a lifetime of worrying about her?
 Yeah, Maybe she went home.
 Okay.
 No she didn't say anything to me. She told Jeremy to tell me that she was leaving town.
 Stefan Salvatore may know. He came by the house to see her but she wouldn't talk to him.
 Up and down, very sketchy, like she was coming down from some major partying.
 Yes.
 Don't be. It's not the first time she's run off. Turns out Vicki's just like our mother; I can't count on either of them. Thanks for trying.
 Oh hey!
 Hammered, huh?
 
 Is that a trick question?
 No offense, Care, but deep's really not your scene.
 You're not a kiddie pool. You're not a kiddie pool.
 I'll take you come on. You're okay. 
 I'll take her home. It's on my way. I haven't been drinking.
 You gonna be okay?
 Life can be a little rough.
 What?
 Yeah me too. 
 Hey.
 Hey.
 What is what?
 
 I heard your mom in the morning, and I didn't want to get you in trouble. So, I went out the window.
 Your mom's the sheriff! And as for the "hey"s, I'm pretty sure it's what I've said to you every day since the first grade. Trying to read something into it? Lame-Girl move.
 Hey.
 Your window was open. I thought you should know.
 
 About being in bed with you. We cuddled and it creeped me out.
  It's just that...I don't like you. I never have. But...it was nice.
 Being in bed with you, it felt nice. And so, I was thinking about it, and I thought that I should tell you I stayed because you were all sad and alone and I felt bad for you.
 
 And then the ballet dancer and the Krumper did the salsa.
 Well, I don’t know when you fell asleep. Umm, did you see the Celine Dion waltz about cancer?
 Yeah, and then the loud judge kept screaming and I couldn't take it, so I turned it off.
 Nothing's up.
 No, it’s not like that.
 "We" people?
 We hung out, like, twice.
 I can’t believe you remember that.
 I was eight.
 I've had it easier. You? I heard some things. 
 Aw, man, not you too.
 We’re friends. 
 No.
 Hey.
 Yeah. He just gave Caroline a ride home.
 Sure.
 Look, I like Caroline. 
 So stop your little bromance bitch act.
 Ben McKittrick. What's up, man?
 Yeah. It's kind of hard to recover when you have to forfeit half your games.
 Yep, followin' in your footsteps, minus the state championship.
 Yeah.
 Busboy.
 I've never seen you such a mess.
 I mean, 
 Well, who knew you could be fun?
 Uh, I'm not goin'.
 I gotta work, bussin' tables at the Grill.
 It's a job. You know, some of us have to work, Caroline. With our mom in and out, things are tight, so...
 Well, I do. I gotta go.
 
 Is that for me?
 Do you need something?
 No, Care. I'm not mad. I...
 I'm not. I'm working.
 No. I have a table to clean. You know, that's the kind of thing that washed-up jocks do to make a living.
 Yes, you were, Caroline. Ben could easily be me. We're just alike.
 Look, can we just not do this right now?
 Look, this thing that we've got, it's nice, and it feels really good, and I know you want to take the next step.
 I'm...I'm not over Elena. I mean, I don't know if I am, but if we go there, then it could mess things up, and we might lose this, and this is the only good thing I've got going for me right now. So if it doesn't work, I'll just disappoint you and hurt you, and I don't wanna do that.
 Caroline!
 Care, get in the truck.
 This'll never work.
 Duke's a douche.
 Do you ever get bored of it?
 Yourself.
 Hey.
 You wrote a speech?
 
 Ooged, huh?
 Yeah, go for it.
 Why are you giving me an escape clause?
 Got it.
 I'm good, but thanks.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Elena, hey!
 We haven't met. I'm Matt.
 Hey!
 Who knows?
 Maybe.
 Look, I just   I don't know if I can do the whole public couple thing. She   she seems like she might be a little clingy.
 Here I am.
 So.
 Okay.
 Yeah, of course. Yeah.
 Is this for real?
 You being all cool and honest and open?
 I don't want to mess it up either.
 What?
 Wow.
 And...
 What? Something like this?
 I don't know. This is a pretty good show.
 Mom! Hey.
 So, it's been a few months. Where've you been?
 No, actually, I don't. Because you never brought him around.
 She's not a flavor, Mom. I like her.
 No, probably not, but maybe.
 Mom, seriously, knock it off.
 So, uh, you heard from Vic?
 Are you playing it now?
 Then what are you doin' home?
 More like embarrassing
 Mom.
 Here we go. Home, sweet home.
 Yeah, you were, mom.
 I know.
 Why are you really home, mom?
 No, you didn't, mom. It's not your fault.
 I'm not going anywhere.
 Hey mom! Mom?
 Hey mom?
 I was just making sure you're alive.
 I would appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home. And I'm pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it too.
 Well, I talked to Roberta at the grill and there's still a bartending position open if you want to...get a job.
 I think she's desperate.
 Yeah?
 Well, I mean...I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
 There's back everything mom.
 It's Caroline.
 Easy.
 Yeah come in!
 Hey, ok. Well we're going to be late. So let's get going.
 Hey.
 How are you?
 We can watch a movie at my place.
 You know...you don't really help the situation. You could at least try to be nice.
 Wherever you want to do it's good for me but I'm late and I got to go OK?
 It's not that bad. Wait staff is pretty good and they can't keep a bartender to save their lives. I actually put my mom up for a job.
 You know, same old Kelly. She's trying, sort of.
 No, we have known each other our whole lives.
 You got to be kidding me.
 Remember when Elena's parents busted us here after the homecoming?
 Her parents got seated at the next booth.
 Except that her dad was a doctor so he jumped up to save her.
 Is there anything you're not good at?
 That's because you're that guy.
 The guy who seems like he has everything, so the people that don't, kind of run the other way.
 Pretty much.
 Yeah.
 No need, I'm awesome.
 Don't remind me.  Man I've always wanted to see what it looks like in this place.
 Yeah, my entire house could fit in here. like twice.
 Whoa; these are great!
 I did the entire Mustang series when I was 9
 It's an understatement.
 Wait, how do you have this?
 Why don't you...I mean...Why don't you drive it?
 Be more of a girl right now?
 Elena, remember the old Camaro you're dad used to have?
 I built and rebuilt that engine 20 times.
 She's good with you. You know, I wasn't sure but she's happy and I'm glad.
 Alright, let's take a look at this.
 Piece of cake!
 Really?
 Caroline?
 Did I just pass the driveway?
 This is an amazing car. Did I pass?
 The whole double date thing was obviously a test to see how I would do around Elena.
 Caroline that stuff came before. It's not just gonna go away.
 No, you don't. Because, you're letting Elena turn you into a crazy person. Look it's my fault. I made it pretty clear early on that Elena still means something to me. But all that talk, that was just two old friends and some memories. Tonight wasn't about me and Elena. I was there because I wanted to be with you. And I don't know what this means or what we are but I do know that you are the only person I want to be in this car with right now. And I don't even know if that makes sense because I'm not really that good at expressing myself.
 Yeah.
 Mom?!
 I got to...
 Thanks, man.
 I don't want to hear it, mom.
 Do you know what I was doing tonight, Mom? I was having fun, you know, trying to forget about all the crap that I have to deal with every day. Just enjoying a night with my friends. And then, there you are, wasted at the bar, where I work, by the way, to pay the bills that you don't pay. And then you're off acting like a freakin' kid, hooking up with some guy half your age. I'm the kid, Mom. You're supposed to be responsible for me.
 I yelled at my mom last night. You know, I feel like the parent yelling at the screwed up kid.
 Yeah, but just...I worry that if I push too hard, then she will take off again. Cause that's her M.O. Just like Vicki, who I haven't heard from since she left.
 I wish that she would just try a little. You know? If she would just try to try, that'd be okay.
 Yeah. Are you sure you should be driving right now?
 Well, buckle up. Don't speed. Stay off your cell phone. And call me when you get there.
 Yes.
 Bye.
 Where are you? I can barely hear you.
 Well, you shouldn't be talking while you're driving.
 Look, you're breaking up. Just turn around and go back the same way you came. And watch the road. Okay?
 Who is that?
 Hey, mom. What's going on?
 Honestly, I wouldn't know. I've never seen it before.
 Mmm. Mystery casserole. Yum.
 What?
 Okay.
 You know I got it.
 What happened to you?
 Hey. What's going on?
 Thanks.
 I just, uh...I need to be alone right now.
 Uncle John, I never really liked that guy.
 I'm here for moral support if you need me.
 Thank you by the way, for just...for everything you did at Vicki's funeral and the memorial. I couldn't have done it without you.
 She finally went to her dad, which is a good thing because my mom was going to strangle her if she dropped off one more lasagna.
 Mayor.
 God, mom!
 Your dad is going to beat you down if he catches you.
 Screw it.
 When did this happen?
 Do you want to dance?
 Yes.
 Who knew I've been missing all the fun at the Founders' parties?
 Is it bad that I'm enjoying myself?
 Hey, it's normal.
 Air, I need some air. Come with me?
 You haven't seen my mom have you?
 What the hell are you doing man?
 Where is she?
 I can't do it anymore mom so just go alright? You've done it before. More times than I can count.
 I want you out of the house and my life by morning.
 Not really, no.
 You're asking me about my mom. Seriously? Look, man, why don't I just give tell her to give you a call when she comes back to town?
 Good men, don't say anything. You're a dick, end of the story.
 Get this trailer! Come on guys help me!
 Caroline can take me.
 I'll wait. Its fine.
 Fine!
 Seriously?
 Okay, fine.
 I'll be on the float.
 Caroline, give it a rest.
 Why? What's going on?
 Wait, what noise?
 Dude, hey! Caroline, the wheel!
 Hey, are you okay?
 No, they need to check you out.
 What's wrong?
 Dude, don't scare me like that!
 Caroline! Guys, over here! Caroline, wake up!
 It's okay man. She'll be alright.
 What's happening? Is she alright?
 What else did they say? Is she gonna be okay?
 She's not good, Bon.
 We were driving and Tyler heard this noise and he got...
 He got this migraine or something and he lost control of the car and...I thought that Caroline was fine and then...and then she wasn't so...
 Yeah, with the sheriff.
 Stefan's brother Damon stopped by late last night.
 See for yourself.
 My turn. (kisses her.)
 Hey guys.
 I am. Thanks Elena. (He leaves.)
 Your mom said you're not eating.
 It's hospital food; it's supposed to be gross.
 She also said you're getting released tomorrow morning.
 No, the carnival is going to happen without you, Caroline. I know it's hard for your neurotic control freak personality to process but Bonnie and Elena have it.
 Yeah you are but it's cute so...
 It's because you're sitting in the dark.
 What the hell?
 What's wrong with you?
 I'll just come back later, okay? (He leaves.)
 What are you doing here?
 How do you feel?
 Yeah, 'cause earlier you were...
 Okay, um, you want to give it a shot?
 Whoa, hey, nice shot, killer!
 What's wrong?
 Wait Care, are you okay, I mean...
 She's obviously pissed at me for something but for what, no clue.
 She freaked out and she's been like that all day. Cool one minute and crazy and neurotic the next.
 Yeah, I'm used to the insecurities and all that. It's who she is, love it or hate it, but this seemed...I don't know...different...more. I can't explain it.
 I came to see if today's basket case period has expired.
 No, look, you've been dodging me all day. I mean, I'm more insecure than you are now.
 It means that...you almost died and it really freaked me out and it got me thinking you know 'cause...I'm not in a position where I can lose someone else right now. I realized, even though today I wanted to throttle you, I'm pretty sure that I'm in love with you and now it seems like you don't feel the same way.
 Caroline? Caroline!
 Hey, I thought you said you were at home. Tyler is doing this whole thing at the swimming hole and I want us to spend the day together. Where are you? Call me.
 All class.
 I wish I knew.
 No. We're fine. I'm fine. I'm just not sure what she is.
 What's your uncle doing here?
 Hey Aimee.
 Not waterproof.
 Uh, I don't know.
 What the hell? I've been calling you.
 Seriously?
 She's harmless; you don't have to be rude.
 You've been dodging my calls all day and you get to show up here and be the jealous girlfriend? It's kind of lame, Care.
 I thought we were past all this insecurity stuff, Caroline. I told you how I felt about you, what more do you need?
 I'm not kidding. I'm not gonna put up with the drama.
 Come on.
 This looks like the spot.
 Did you hear that?
 Ah, damn.
 I'm a klutz. What's the matter?
 Caroline? What are you doing? Ah! Caroline! Caroline!
 Caroline! Your face!
 We were just making out in the woods.
 It's weird; it just came out of nowhere.
 I'm better, thanks. How are you?
 I'll be fine.
 Are you kidding me?
 Knock it off. What are you doing?
 I thought you said no more drama?
 Just forget it, just forget all of it.
 Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's what I'm doing.
 Wait, wait, wait, Tyler!
 She's this amazing girl one minute and then this raging, jealous freak the next.
 Hey!
 Yeah. I'm gonna go get an extension cord. I'll be right back.
 So, where's Caroline? This is like her thing. I can't believe she's not here.
 Is she seeing someone?
 I'm not even gonna ask.
 I'm going to go after Tyler Lockwood.
 And I'm not going to stop.
 Until he kills me.
 Do you need a table?
 Easy. Grab the door Jer.
 No.
 Yeah, I mean I've done it like twenty times at the Grill.
 Okay, I'm being nice.
 Easy, easy.
 What should I do with this?
 I'd love to but I'm going to the masquerade party at the Lockwoods, aren't you?
 I've got to go, there's something I got to do.
 Just something, I can't talk about it but I've got to go.
 Yeah. Me and a suit.
 You and Stefan will work it out.
 You know I'm here for you always.
 Elena?
 I thought you said you weren't coming.
 I'm gonna get Tyler Lockwood really drunk. I'm going to start a fight with him and I'm gonna beat him until he snaps.
 I won't stop until he kills me.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, I know but we really need to turn this party up. Another shot?
 I don't know, she disappeared.
 Like me.
 What man? It's a party.
 Right dad? You know, looks like your dad wants a drink.
 Come on, the guy was a dick.
 Remember how your dad used to slap you around?
 I'm just having fun.
 Do something about it!
 I can't! Let me go, I have to finish!
 Let me go!
 Hey man, how you doing?
 I'm pissed at myself for picking a fight with you. And feeling guilty for what happened to Sarah. I mean, I've been dodging you for days because I didn't know what to say to you.
 I'm really sorry. Please know that.
 Hey.
 I   I've been better. I gotta   I gotta get to class.
 I know I should have called. I'm sorry.
 I don't know, but I was driving home from work and I just-I kinda found myself here.
 I miss you.
 Yeah.
 Hey.
 Caroline, you got a second?
 I believe you. Look, Caroline, you're a lot a things but you're not a liar. You've always been straight with me, I believe you.
 And that's why I want to be straight with you because I...I think we got some wires crossed here.
 And you know how tongue-tied I get and I don't like this. Whatever this is that's going on between us and I...I just want to...
 Why?
 But Care...
 Caroline. Why?
 I kissed you.
 So why did you run away?
 Yeah?
 Not that.
 And...?
 Something, anything. How did you feel? Anything in the realm of truth right now would be nice.
 I love you then what's the problem? What are you keeping from me, Care? Look, if you love me you'll tell me, so what is it?
 Yeah, not now Dana.
 Hey! Hey!
 I haven't seen you.
 Yeah, you're avoiding me a little.
 Can we talk later? I mean, I'm heading to work right now, but maybe after, to clear some of this weirdness?
 Sounds good.
 Hey. Did something happened?
 Are you okay?
 Yeah so you're with her right now?
 Yeah, sure. I hope everything works out. Good night.
 I'm...I'm working.
 What do you want, Caroline?
 Now you're just making it worse.
 Where were you last night when you were supposed to be with me?
 And don't say you were with Bonnie because Bonnie was here, Caroline. I saw her.
 Yeah.
 The two of you want to get together, fine. There's nothing I can do about it, but do me a favor, and both of you stop lying about it.
 Hey! I said stop lying.
 I'm not in the mood, man.
 All right. Say it.
 Yeah, man. Of course.
 Yeah.
 Hey.
 Yeah, business has been a little slow. The Grill's trying to stay afloat.
 Have you heard from Tyler?
 No, not since he stopped by the Grill to talk, and I've left messages on his cell phone.
 Not much, really. I mean...I think to say good-bye without really saying good-bye. I just didn't know it.
 Yeah. Yeah, that's all he said, Caroline. Why? I mean, is there something you want to tell me?
 I don't get it! Since when have am I the one that can express himself and you're the one at a loss for words?
 You know how I feel. So it's your move. Just make a decision or leave me alone.
 You know, I really have to get back to work.
 What the hell?
 The power's out.
 I wish, but I should probably go help.
 Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie!
 Bonnie! Bonnie! Hey, Bonnie!
 Caroline!
 Get away from her!
 What the hell? Your face...And all the blood. I...I drank your blood.
 What do you mean, it healed me? How can your blood heal me?
 No.
 We'll be fine?!
 Vampires. Oh, my God. Vicki, oh, my God, at the hospital, I thought that she was tripping out.
 Vicki, she knew about vampires, and I...What...what did you do?
 I need to get out of here.
 What did you do to my sister?
 What did you do?!
 Sheriff Forbes.
 I wanna see Vicki's file.
 My sister, I want to see her file. I want to see how you covered up that she was killed by a vampire.
 Don't lie to me.
 Your mom brought me here.
 I accused her of covering up Vicki's death and she threatened to arrest me.
 Nothing about you.
 I got the feeling she wasn't gonna believe anything I said, so I shut up. Then she brought me here to cool down, and then she got called away.
 Because I need to know more about Vicki, about you.
 I'm all alone.
 My mom doesn't care, my sister's dead, and all of my friends are liars, and you're a...
 Don't. No. This is too much. All of this is just too much. I don't want to know this.
 You can make me forget. You've done it to me before.
 Please make me forget, Caroline. I don't wanna look at you and see what I'm seeing right now.
 Just make me forget, Caroline!
 I did it. I drank that vervain stuff. I went over there, and I got her to tell me everything. Then I asked her to take it away.
 I feel like she died.
 I know. I came to see you. I don't know what to do. What to say, how to act around her.
 She wants me to take her to the dance. What am I supposed to do?
 I'll never get away with it. She knows me too well, she'll figure it out.
 I know, but...
 A werewolf.
 That'll never fool her.
 Just practicing for tonight.
 So I...found a suit. If you still want me to be JFK tonight.
 Hey.
 Sheriff.
 Bye.
 I'm a really bad dancer.
 You look really pretty tonight.
 Hey, man, what's up?
 No, not at all. I'll get us something to drink.
 What was that about?
 Ohh. Jeez!
 It's okay, I just, I didn't know you were here.
 I have lunch in an hour.
 Okay.
 No, but...I can't do this anymore. I've been with her the past few days, and I'm putting on the best show of my life. But either she is too, or she's still the same Caroline.
 At this point, I don't even know what that means.
 There's nothing about her that makes me believe that.
 I could ask you the same question, Sheriff. Why haven't you done anything? Why are you hesitating?
 Damon is the problem, not Caroline. You should focus on him.
 Hey, Caroline, it's me. I thought you were coming back to meet me. Look, I need to talk to you. It's important.
 Where's Caroline?
 Where is she? And what did he do to her?
 What's happening? Is he okay?
 Tyler!
 Is that going to hold?
 Caroline, let me help!
 Caroline, the door's not going to hold.
 Come on!
 It's trying to kill us!
 Caroline, stay back.
 Are you nuts?
 I got it.
 We're not safe here. If that thing wants in, it's getting in.
 I was on vervain. I faked forgetting so I could spy on you. It was your mom's idea.
 Your mom hates vampires. She grew up hating vampires. She'll probably always hate vampires.
 What about me?
 Stuck in this house. Trying not to get mauled to death by our friend.
 You don't think I killed him, do you?
 I don't think your mom knows what to do with you.
 What is it?
 What the hell are you doing?
 What?
 How's Tyler doing?
 Good. 
 You know, these last few days with you have been so great, and fun.
 And so Caroline. I-I thought that I might be able to get past this whole vampire thing.
 I don't - I don't know if I can, Caroline.
 I get it. This is your life now. You know what my life is, Care? My life is an absentee mom. And a bunch of bills to pay, and school, and a job, and it - and it sucks sometimes. But it's my life. And...I think that I just want to live it without all of this.
 I need you to switch sections with me.
 Caroline and Tyler just sat in mine.
 So? I don't feel like waiting on my ex-girlfriend.
 Where did you get that?
 So, what's got you on your spiral downward? Sure it's a lot more interesting than mine.
 Go for it.
 Yeah, Elena told me.
 What kind of things?
 What's Bonnie say about it?
 Hey guys.
 Happy Birthday.
 Since when are they a thing?
 I'm not ignoring you.
 Maybe because every time I've seen you, you've been with him.
 Aren't you guys supposed to be like mortal enemies? I mean isn't that how it works in vampire werewolf universe?
 I don't know. I'm out of it...I guess. Sorry.
 I can't find my truck.
 You're more stoned than I am.
 Hey. What'd you just say?
 Did you just say "Vicki", as in my sister Vicki?
 What's wrong?
 All right, I should probably go before Elena and Mr. Saltzman come home and see what a bad example I am.
 We'll see. Can I take the ice cream with me?
 What happened in the car, man?
 Come on, man. You said, "Vicki". All right, you said my sister's name. Why? You said you were seeing things?
 I mean, I think I see her all the time, too. It's 'cause I miss her so much, though. You know, like, I want to see her so I do. Look, I know we've got our hands full with all the supernatural stuff in this town, but...ghosts?
 Please tell me you're not turning into one of these losers that hangs out at work on his day off.
 Honestly, Jer, last night is kind of a blur.
 Why are you...why are you telling me this? You're dating a witch. Why don't you tell her?
 No, no, no, no, no, no. We're...We're not contacting my sister.
 If you're messing with me, man...
 You moving in or something? You've been here forever.
 Not keeping up on her comings and goings anymore.
 It is what it is. Tonight's a full moon. She usually helps you?
 Do you, uh...Is this like the kind of thing that you need another person for?
 Heh. It's the vervain. The sheriff has me slip it into the coffee here every now and then.
 Yeah. I'm surprised you can taste it, the coffee usually hides the flavour. For humans, anyway.
 So this is all her stuff. We were supposed to donate it, but, uh, you know.
 Does her pipe count?
 I don't know why I let you talk me into this, man.
 I can't do this. You gotta go.
 Nah, man. I can't do this, all right? You gotta go.
 I'm sorry about earlier.
 I spent the day going through her stuff. It was weird, you know, all the memories. I realize that most people didn't really get Vic. You know, they saw her as trouble and let it go at that. But you really got her. You know, you...you got her better than I did most of the time so...I don't know what we're gonna do with all this, but...here.
 Nah, she didn't.
 I don't either. I don't remember the last moment I had with Vicki before she was a vampire...when she was still my sister.
 Do you see something? Is she here?
 What is she saying? Tell me.
 Clearly.
 I'm kind of surprised any of you are doing this.
 You sound like Caroline.
 I know. Where's Jeremy tonight?
 Ohh. Good, I'm glad that you know.
 No, I...I just kind of want to see her myself, you know? I mean, I never got to say good-bye to her.
 Do you realize that just last summer, you and I were lifeguards at the pool? And the only two problems I had in my life were that Elena was breaking up with me and I sucked at CPR.
 Yeah. Now Elena's dating a vampire, you're a witch, my sister's a ghost, and...I'm...I'm just a guy who's wondering how life got so screwed up.
 It just, uh, kind of explains why I'm not that into senior prank night. I'll go grab a couple more rolls. Then we'll hit the gym.
 He killed him.
 What are you going to do?
 Can you ask those dead witches that helped you before?
 Did you find Jeremy?
 All right, I'll grab my keys. We'll head to his house.
 What the hell?
 You've got to be kidding me!
 Whoa! Vicki?
 This is going to sound crazy, but I think Vicki's trying to reach out to me.
 I think she can help us save Tyler.
 We can't find Jeremy. We need to try something else. I have an idea but I'm going to need your help. Meet me at the pool.
 Jeremy can see ghosts because you brought him back from the dead. I need you to do that for me.
 This is going to work, trust me.
 You don't need magic, Bonnie. You just have to be better than I was at CPR.
 Vicki?
 I can see you.
 Why, what's happening? Where are we?
 It worked. I saw her. I saw Vicki.
 She said she had a message for you.
 From the witch that put the hybrid curse on Klaus. She said that Elena shouldn't have survived Klaus' ritual. The hybrids can't transition because Elena's still alive.
 He's going to die, isn't he?
 Yeah, just a sec.
 I know. Bonnie. I know. But it worked. It was worth it.
 I get it, Bonnie. I'll be out in a minute, okay? Vicki's here. Watching me, and I just, uh, I just need a minute to say good-bye, okay?
 Bon, seriously, I'm not going to do anything stupid, I just...
 Vicki?
 You can't just keep appearing like this. Freaks me out.
 Well, I was just thinking about our first day last year. I was worried about running into Elena and you said...
 Yeah. Instead, she met a vampire.
 Yeah, I just, life stuff. You know, with you gone and mom not around, it's...A lot to deal with alone. I'm glad I get to talk to you, though. I miss you.
 What do you mean come back?
 What's got you in such a good mood?
 Figured you'd feel comfortable here.
 So what do you mean that I can help you come back?
 How?
 The other side?
 I could ask you the same question.
 Can he not see you anymore?
 Who's helping you?
 But you'll still be a ghost, Vicki.
 Seriously. You're going to make jokes about this?
 What do I have to do?
 This is too weird.
 I accept you.
 I felt that.
 I feel that, too.
 The witch didn't mention this part?
 What are you talking about? What deal, Vic?
 You can't kill Tyler, Vicki.
 What? Vicki, no!
 I messed up, Bonnie.
 I'm so sorry. I didn't think she'd do something like this. I trusted her.
 What do I do?
 Fixing my mistake.
 Bonnie...
 I can't let you hurt anyone, Vicki.
 I have to. This is wrong. You shouldn't be here.
 Neither did I. But I have to let you go.
 Goodbye, Vick.
 She's gone.
 I haven't seen Vicki, I swear. I sent her back like you told me to.
 She's gone, Bonnie. If she was here, I'd know it.
 I've had enough of this ghost stuff to last forever. So you guys can leave me out of this one.
 Elena...
 Hey.
 What happened?
 This is weird! Us being here together...
 What?
 Plan's changed. I need a drink.
 What'd you do to her?
 What's going on?
 What do you mean can't?
 By attacking Caroline?
 Happy birthday!
 Except for the tequila!
 Mean girl, sometimes, no offense.
 Ouch, Bon.
 You know, you guys are ruining a perfect funeral.
 
 Yeah, I want her to be happy, you know? It's what I want for all of you guys, in the middle of this crazy life you got stuck living.
 I'd say it's attached itself to you all pretty tight, yeah.
 Caroline!
 Caroline!
 
 Tyler bit her.
 She's been hallucinating or something, I don't know. No one's picking up their phone.
 You made him do this to her. He would have never done something like this.
 You're not gonna jump, are you?
 I was buzzed, Elena. I can't be held responsible for being judgmental.
 You're not that girl anymore. It's okay if you want to let her go.
 My two cents, as a guy who knew that other girl  you're doing a lot better than you think.
 Here lies Elena Gilbert. A fun girlfriend and an amazing friend.
 Hey.
 Are you doing okay? This has to bring up a lot for you.
 It's this town, it's messed up. None of us should have to live this way.
 Electricity must be out.
 What the hell?
 No, leave it in! Leave it in! He's lost too much blood. I'm gonna call 911.
 I know, I know, Elena. I know.
 But, how do you know who did this is supernatural?
 Elena! No, this is messed up!
 He's still out?
 Of course.
 How's Mr. Saltzman?
 Yeah, she's holding it together, considering how close she and her dad used to be. Any word on who's behind these attacks?
 Honestly...I'm kind of lucky, the only thing that I have to worry about for tomorrow, is showing up for my shift at the Grill.
 Get home safe.
 What was I supposed to say, no? And why the hell are you here with Klaus?
 So...What are we doing out here?
 It's freezing. Let me get my coat.
 Yep. 
 Matt Donovan.
 Aah!
 Aah!
 Well let's see, I went to a dance and got my hand crushed. I found out that I don't have health insurance, so I just needed a minute to myself.
 Maybe you could just leave me alone.
 Look, Rebekah, you're really fun and pretty and all, but I really need you to leave me alone.
 What are we running, a marathon?
 Elena, you can't outrun your problems.
 Though it looks like you're gonna try. I talked to Bonnie!
 They're at her mom's house. Abby is gonna complete the transition.
 Yeah. Caroline's gonna help her through it. Teach her to control it and stuff.
 She knows it's not your fault, Elena, she's just upset.
 You're gonna make me run more, aren't you?
 Who is it?
 All that breaking and entering adds to the list of life favors you owe me.
 Don't you think the police already combed through this place? She handed over everything she had.
 And you're sure it's her we should be investigating?
 Alaric Saltzman.
 What's this?
 Why is one of your old family journals in her closet?
 Didn't you say the medical examiners time of death was between one and three a.m.?
 Because the county coroner's office says that's wrong.
 Oh my God.
 Why would she have a copy hidden in her closet?
 Elena, let's just go.
 Elena!
 I just don't get it. Your thing with them.
 Safe? Elena, he's a vampire.
 What?
 Like your parents did. And Damon?
 Once you fall in love with someone, I don't know if...I don't know if you can ever shake them.
 No. Not really. I got you something.
 It's your family's, you should have it. Meredith and that idiot deputy were too busy questioning you to give a damn about me. Sometimes it pays to be the only normal one in a town of vampires. I'm practically invisible.
 Hey. What's with the cryptic secret meeting text?
 What are we doing here?
 How?
 Do I have a choice?
 Mr. Saltzman was like the most normal guy in town.
 Is it weird that Klaus' brother is in the middle of town square?
 Yeah, cool, I'll let your waitress know.
 It's the decade dance. Remember, you made us sign up to help?
 Maybe we can do both decades?
 Bell bottoms and disco? I don't know, this just seemed cooler.
 Caroline! Wait!
 And you bought yourself a day.
 You too. And uh, tell him I said hi. Okay?
 Here we are. Home, sweet, home.
 I drove you home. You don't have a car.
 Buy what?
 It's sad that you can't just get a ride home from school without thinking there is some ulterior motive.
 Let's not get crazy. Good bye, Rebekah.
 Trickle, duh!
 Yeah, I'm one of the good ones, I know...Why the compliments, what else do you want?
 And your point is...?
 Elena is my friend, Caroline. I'm just looking out for her.
 What's he doing here?
 People are walking right out of the dance, past the barrier.
 Don't move!
 I can't! I'm not controlling it!
 Mr. Saltzman.
 You know, to be honest, I'm a little pissed none of you let me help you take down Original brother number two.
 Please, I'm more stealth than that. I'm like a ninja.
 
 You have to go. See if you can sneak out.
 Gotta see Coach Tanner. Love you.
 Tyler and Caroline got a call from their moms. What were you dreaming about?
 Seems like forever ago.
 Which one?
 Wouldn't it be smarter if we just got you the hell out of town?
 So, you're just gonna let her call the shots?
 Even if they're wrong?
 Why should she trust you? All you've done is screw her over.
 So what are you gonna do?
 So why don't we?
 I do.
 Sorry, I over-honeyed. I suck at tea.
 So, Stefan?
 So, do you feel like you owe him or something?
 So then, what's the problem?
 It's the only way I was gonna get you in this truck.
 I'm sorry, Elena, but you're right, okay. You don't have any parents to tell you what's right or wrong, you've got me and Jeremy and a bunch of vampires fighting a war you shouldn't be in the middle of.
 I'm getting you out of town, Elena. It's the only way to keep you safe.
 Got it, Jer.
 Elena.
 Damon's not with them.
 He's a hundred miles out of town. I can keep driving to him or I can turn around and go back to Stefan. It's your choice.
 What now?
 Damn it!
 Damn it, damn it, damn it!
 This isn't how our lives were supposed to be, Elena.
 Here. Use mine.
 Elena doesn't want to be a vampire.
 It's all my fault. I was driving. I was saved. She's a vampire because of me!
 If the Council is after you, then why are you here?
 Can I help you?
 Hey, is Elena here?
 The Pastor has a cattle ranch. 
 So, what, we just storm the place with zero weapons?
 Go ahead and kill me. You can't possibly hate me more than I hate myself.
 Just stop! Stop saving me.
 What do you want me to say? Thank you? Cause honestly, I wish you'd have just let me drown.
 Elena's a vampire...because of me. I have to live with that every day for the rest of my life.
 So, what are these again?
 Nobody thought fire might be a little inappropriate.
 How is she?
 If there's anything I can do, you know, short of giving her a ride, you'll let me know, right? I'm only alive because she told Stefan to save me first. She's a vampire because of me, so I'd like to pay it back or forward or whatever.
 Elena used to babysit you. Yeah, I remember.
 Your dad was Pastor Young, right?
 How are you feeling? A little strung out?
 You didn't have to volunteer.
 April Young. Yeah.
 You okay?
 What's wrong with her?
 So, get her out of here.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. Elena, feed from me.
 It's okay, everyone will think you're upset. Just feed from me.
 It's okay. You'll be okay.
 That was insane. How do you think they'll cover this one up?
 Altar boy goes postal.
 Uh, girlfriend went a little overboard.
 What ink?
 He didn't have a tattoo.
 This is for Vicki.
 
 It's okay. I kind of owe you my life, remember?
 Elena, please, just...
 Was that enough?
 So, you really think school is the best place for you right now?
 Tyler got shot in front of half the town. Everyone's a little freaked.
 I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know where I got that.
 
 You don't look so hot.
 Well, I thought about it. You explained why you ran me off the bridge, so the least I could do is explain how I feel. The truth is Rebekah, I think you're amazing.
 You've had a thousand years to learn, to grow, and to start fresh. And somehow you've managed to throw it all away. Now you're alone. You're compelling your friends. Your brother hates you. You whine about not finding love. The reason you don't find love is because you don't deserve it.
 Elena, hey! If I had known you were gonna go to that party, I never would have told Connor about Rebekah.
 Honestly, Elena, Rebekah kind of deserves it.
 
 Elena. Elena, that hurts. Elena. Elena!
 Elena! Elena!
 What's that?
 If that's your idea of an apology, you should probably give it to Elena. She's the one that you killed.
 Hey April. Can I get you some more water?
 You two are friends?
 Yeah, it is. And I'm keeping the truck.
 Really? Jeremy, you're half an hour late. Get here now.
 Uh, hey, April. We don't open until eleven.
 Why would I have seen Rebekah?
 
 If you know so much, then you know our friends are going to come for us.
 Hey, this guy's a nut job, okay? Don't let him get in your head.
 Let it go. Jeremy!
 They're just stories.
 Look, this is a messed up situation, but the last thing you want to do is buy into that guy's craziness. 
 There used to be an exit to the old wine cellar. 
 
 Oh my God.
 Okay. 
 There was a gas leak.
 I should probably get home too.
 I like it. It looks good on you. You should wear it.
 Are you okay?
 Yeah, tell me about it.
 What's wrong?
 Are you serious?
 So what does that make you? Like, the next chosen one or something?
 Hey April.
 Disappeared, yeah I know.
 That guy knew your dad?
 You're still saving a spot for Mr. Saltzman, huh?
 I know that you don't like me.
 But I dug up some stuff about the explosion at the Young farm, I kind of need to tell someone about.
 So, April mentioned that her dad knew that Professor Shane guy. Which wouldn't be creepy, except, he had all that info about the hunter's curse, and we live in a town where, you know, anybody who knows stuff is creepy until proven otherwise.
 I got the Sheriff to dig up the pastor's phone records. Turns out, he made like a call a day to the same number the last month he was alive. And on the day that the Council got blown up at the farm, he called it ten times. The office of Professor Atticus Shane.
 So, your sister is making me be her date. Think I'll have to do that weird dance thing?
 I heard that you're April's escort. How'd that happen?
 Okay, let's just take these in and we'll come back for the kegs.
 How did you just do that?
 Jer, I think you need to talk to someone about this. I mean, look what happened to Connor, okay. A byproduct of this energy is that you're gonna want to kill vampires and you happen to live with one.
 How do you wake up with a knife in your hand and not remember how it got there? It's that hunter's mark, Jer. It's messing with you.
 "Newly awakened hunters may not be fully conscious of their actions. Their sub-conscious pushes through until the urge becomes a basic instinct."
 You're not having a psychotic break, Jer. You either tell Elena or I will.
 All right, we should probably get going. Need a ride?
 All right.
 Have you seen Jeremy?
 Yeah, Caroline told me to wrangle the escorts. He's not here.
 Did he tell you about his nightmares?
 The ones where he kills you.
 I got this.
 Jeremy's running late.
 You lead.
 Jeremy!
 Jeremy, you don't want to do this, okay. That's your sister! It's that stupid mark on your arm.
 Jeremy, look at me! I'm human and I'm telling you not to hurt her.
 Come on. Let's get out of here.
 What are you doing?
 Elena knows that. That's why she moved out and asked me to move in.
 Look, I'm not one of them, Jer. I'll keep an eye on you and we can keep this Hunter business in check.
 There you are. Stefan's been looking for you. Adrian's leading Klaus to the Cellar.
 April saw you?
 No, she's – she's wearing Jeremy's vervain bracelet.
 She can't be compelled.
 I drove up here to be your wingman, not kick your ass.
 Okay I get it, I get it. You're a badass.
 Jeremy, you're not ready for this.
 I don't have to listen to you.
 Don't tell me we ordered another pizza?
 Yeah, come in. I'll run upstairs and grab my cell.
 Did you kill all these people?
 Wait a second!
 Yeah, I just need a second.
 All right, where are the other vampires?
 
 What did you expect, Elena? It's Damon.
 Well, then you shouldn't have left him in charge. Look. I'm sorry. I know you didn't have a choice. Sire bond and all.
 All I know, Elena, is that the old you would have never left Jeremy with Damon, especially after what happened last night.
 I took two days off to help you out at the lake house, remember? I almost got killed?
 He's in the back, I think.
 Yeah. All things considered.
 Me, too.
 
 Poison your best friend once, and suspicion follows you forever. 
 That's funny. Doesn't he hate her?
 That's some messed-up logic.
 
 Elena...There's nothing you can do right now, okay? Stefan can stay here with him. Come with me. 
 
 Remember when Jer was so into my sister?
 I found this after Vick died. It made me smile...and this.
 
 
 I would tell you that it's okay to have hope...because sometimes that's all that keeps me going.
 
 Bonnie, you can't kill 12 people.
 Caroline, I think she knows that.
 Elena, I'll get it 
 Get some sleep, Bon. We'll talk tomorrow.
 
 Can't really blame her.
 
 
 Tyler sent me this package in the mail. 
 Why do I feel like we're at a practice run of Caroline's wedding?
 Me too. And we wanna help you.
 I don't want you to look back and realize you missed out on the best part of senior year.
 Bonnie, wait.
 We're not a thing, we're friends. So who are you here with?
 You know, actually, I was thinking, "I wonder if Bonnie wants ice".
 Why? Apparently, you already seem to know everything I'm thinking, so...
 I think that "good" is a hard word to live up to, and I've never seen you do anything remotely good, so...Honestly, no, I don't. I'm sorry.
 You haven't seen Bonnie, have you?
 I don't think so.
 I don't understand why my opinion is so important to you.
 I'm a bus boy, Rebekah, okay? It's not like I'm out saving the world.
 Okay, in the meantime, how do we look out for a guy that can appear as anyone?
 I can't really do that right now.
 Bonnie!
 Okay, just relax.
 No!
 April, April, come on, please wake up!  April, come on! Please wake up!
 Can you feed her your blood?
 She's dying. Please help her!
 How is this even a choice right now?  You want to be human?  Prove it, be good, do the right thing and save her life.
 Thank you for saving her.
 No one has to know what you did. I won't tell anyone.
 I would. And maybe I was a little harsh earlier. You wouldn't make the worst human.
 
 All right, let's stand up.
 I was working. I see you compelled the bartenders again.
 Yeah, I heard about that.
 I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted it.
 I meant what I said, but if you wanna feel sorry for yourself, go ahead.
 I can't, I've gotta go meet Caroline.
 Elena was my friend long before she was your mean-girl sidekick. So if you're upset that you lost the cure and your brothers ditched you, why are you still in Mystic Falls? Some of us don't have the option of leaving, some of us are broke, and failing all of our classes, and stuck here. So why don't you take your freedom and get the hell out of town? I would.
 Well, what do you wanna talk about?
 You did?
 It's gonna work. We're gonna get Elena back.
 Thanks.
 Well, I didn't exactly ask her.
 I'm not failing, I'm just...really, really behind in history...and Italian, and math...
 This year's been a little distracting.
 She likes projects.
 What time will Caroline return from the train station?
 Not everyone's had a thousand years to learn everything about everything.
 So can you help, or not?
 I'm sorry, I just don't wanna get left behind while all my friends go to college and I'm the only repeat-senior.
 I don't wanna do that.
 
 I'm calling Caroline. There's no way we're letting that psycho in there with Elena.
 Caroline! Where've you been?
 No, Caroline, wait. It's okay.
 What are you talking about? What's Silas want with you?
 If I knew where she was, I wouldn't bother with you. 
 Elena's gone? What happened?
 Elena, stop. I know you don't wanna do this. I know you don't wanna hurt me.
 No, but you're more than that! You're my friend! You're my oldest friend. You're the girl that I've loved longer than I can remember. Whatever wall you wanna put up, I know that still means something to you.
 
 
 Elena.
 You mean getting my neck snapped or coming back from the dead? 'Cause they both hurt like hell. Did it work?
 She saved me from drowning at the bottom of that river. I'm just doing what I can to pay her back.
 Pretty much.
 I don't have a whole lot of family.
 Let's just say I'm not holding my breath for a graduation check.
 This wind is weird. One minute it was blowing like a hurricane, now nothing, not even a breeze.
 You know, you don't have to be here. I mean, technically only one of us is getting paid.
 I'm assuming this means Bonnie dropped the veil.
 If you hurt Elena, I swear 
 I'll be fine.
 It's not you, I just...Look, people in this town have a bad habit of turning into vampires, and I'd like to graduate high school as a human.
 I think there's a First Aid kit in the back.
 She's been here this whole time - that means Silas is with you.
 Yeah, it gets worse. The veil's down. Kol came by looking for Elena, and he seemed a little pissed.
 We'll handle this, just...watch your back.
 Have you tried compelling her?
 In case Caroline didn't thank you for pulling her out of that hallucination earlier...thanks.
 Who the hell is that?
 Or not.
 Just go, Rebekah. I'll be fine.
 Just ignore him. All right? Let's think about something else. Like graduation. What are your plans – college? Travel? Just because I'm never getting out of this town doesn't mean you shouldn't see the world.
 
 So...he seems nice.
 I'm wearing the Gilbert ring. I can't be killed by anything supernatural, so maybe if you're the one who detonates the bomb, then I won't die.
 There's only one way to find out.
 What are you doing?
 No.
 
 Oh, you know, making plans for the summer, dodging death by vampire hunter.
 Hey...What are you doing here?
 Thanks. Look, I'd invite you in, but I promised Tyler I was gonna keep this a low-vampire zone.
 You and I...this isn't gonna work. I need to keep my love life a low-vampire zone, too, okay?
 So whatever happens on the road, stays on the road, all right? 
 I've never set one foot outside of this town. I have no college plans, no idea what the future holds for me...But I do know that it's time that I start truly living. And, since you almost killed me this year, I figured it's your obligation to show me how.
 I thought we said no strings?
 Weren't you leaving town?
 I have to work. I'm back in the real world now, I need a paycheck.
 Those earrings don't bring you back to life. How am I gonna explain to Jeremy she stole his Gilbert ring?
 Here you go, Mayor. This one's on the house.
 So, ah, when's Bonnie coming back?
 Yeah.
 You're welcome.
 No way.
 Nadia?
 Yeah, I remember you. You got Rebekah and me drunk and robbed us.
 How did you know how to find me?
 You traveled four thousand miles to give me back a ring?
 No, I want it.
 Hurts, doesn't it?
 Not as much as this will.
 How many people have you killed using that excuse? Just be glad we got you some clothes.
 Well, you can't, because as soon as we get gas, we're getting back on the road.
 Fine.
 Just this.
 
 I'm gonna go get some wood for the fire. I'll be back.
 
 Jeremy?
 Jeremy, hey, there you are, man. What—
 What the hell?
 Bonnie, what's going on? Where the hell am I?
 My body's not even here.
 Wait. If I'm on the Other Side, how can you see me?
 Bonnie, you don't have to pretend like it's okay. Your dad died, and...you died. That's not okay.
 I am so sorry.
 I think someone moved my body. It's weird, but I can feel it...it's like I'm drawn to it.
 So, if this happens every time I die with the Gilbert ring, the second I go back, that means I'm just gonna forget about all of this. I'll forget that you're dead. Bonnie, you and Jeremy can't keep this a secret anymore. I'm sorry your dad died. I know it's hard, but how are you gonna deal with his death if you can't even deal with your own?
 What the hell happened?
 Fine.
 What the hell did you do to me? Look, I know you and your creep-show boyfriend screwed with my head the other night, so who the hell are you and what do you want?
 Silas? What do you know about Silas?
 Hello?
 Wait. We talked on the phone today? When?
 Yeah, yeah. I remember. Um, can I call you back tomorrow?
 Hey, Jer. You got a sec? Um, I'm kind of freaking out here.
 So, I woke up last night covered in mud with this.
 Yeah, I know. I have no idea where it came from. I blacked out, and I'm pretty sure that it's not the first time.
 No. I don't think it's the Gilbert ring that's messing with me. No. Like, it's got to have something to do with why Silas couldn't mind-control me. He saw something or someone or whatever that Czech freak put in my head, but I think it's still there.
 I set them up all over the house to help me figure out how I'm losing time. Have you talked to Bonnie? I think that she's the only person that might know what's going on here.
 So she can't pick up?! I sent her, like, 300 e-mails this summer, and she writes back twice. Did I do something to piss her off?
 Jer, look. I need you to help me get in contact with her, okay? I haven't slept, okay? I'm scared I'm going crazy here. I need her help.
 What? Where?
 Hello?
 Děkuji, Kristof. 
 Cestování bezpecné. 
 Hello, Matt Donovan. I'm the passenger inside you. I know you have many questions, but all you need to know is that one day my friends will come looking for this blade. Protect it at all costs...
 Yeah, I noticed. So, you're not gonna believe this, but–
 What? Is she back? 
 No! You're drunk and scaring the customers.
 You translate, you drink.
 So, over the summer, I went to Prague, met a girl. She followed me back here. Then, her boyfriend put some kind of spirit thing in my head.
 Why?
 What do you mean "activated" me?
 So how the hell do I get it out of me?
 
 What? You know her?
 Okay. So here's the knife the Traveler left behind with me. Now, what are we doing in here?
 3, 4, 5, 6.
 Good try.
 Yeah, that will happen.
 Deep breaths. 
 It's Nadia. I told her you where here.
 Damn!
 Look. We're closing, so...
 Yeah. I'd kind of rather just put us, um, behind us.
 The Travelers' knife? No way. I just got rid of that thing.
 Why, and why do people want it?
 
 
 
 What the hell?
 Why?
 Who spends two years pining after a girl, to dump her?
 So you're sure it was just a fight?
 Uh...
 My sister's dead because of her.
 Elena...We're were just...uh...
 We're going to need more booze.
 Nadia?
 Hey. Where have you been?
 So, who else do you see over there? Anybody I know?
 What's happening?
 Wait...What's happening? What am I missing?
 Hmmm. I wonder. Elena Gilbert?
 You're in a good mood!
 Yes, we are. We're partying tonight.
 So, what did you want to talk to me about?
 No. I wear this bracelet. In case anyone needs my blood, remember?
 What are you doing? I need that!
 Katherine is dead.
 Oh my god...
  I'm not doing this.
  'So, you're dead and hitching a ride in her brain?
  '''Permanent... how?
  'I don't know. She did it in New York, right after she shut her humanity off.
  October 13th.
  June 22nd.
  2104 Maple Street, but you burnt your house down.
 You love them both equally.
 Have you seen my phone?
 TY!
 Have, you, seen, my, phone? I'm late for work, dude.
 Nah.. you know, I'm good seeing as how it's 7 42.
 Okay. So are you going to tell me what happened in New Orleans?
 We're celebrating. So clean this place up and invite some people. And...shower. It's a stink.
 Yeah. Legally. It's not like I pay the bills.
 Is that your lame way of asking if I invited Caroline?
 Yeah. She's coming.
 'So. What do ya say, you're starting over? You're basically saying you want Caroline back?
 Matty?
 Right.. sorry about that.
 Alright. I'm going to go make the rounds. Do you need anything?
 Hey.
 Why don't we get out of it for a while? You know.. just go somewhere, be anywhere but here.
 So you're trying to get back with Stefan?
 Yeah, I guess.
 I thought you said you weren't drinking today.
 Whatever you're thinking, unthink it. That's Katherine's daughter, and the psycho doesn't fall far from the tree.
 You locked me in a safe and buried me alive.
 What?
 It's your funeral.
 Ha, ha, ha!
 My mom hooked up with you.
 There's got to be a fire hydrant joke in there somewhere.
 I thought that was funny.
 I don't know. I've never met him.
 He's Damon's buddy from Augustine. They were cellmates for 5 years. I think he's free or something.
 Nadia's not compelling me.
 Right here. (He shows up his wrist up for Tyler to see but he realizes his bracelet is gone.)
 Why would Nadia be compelling me?
 Yeah. Sheriff Forbes makes me put it in the coffee.
 Who keeps calling you?
 Caroline? I have no idea.
 Not that I know of.
 Why are you asking me about Elena?
 Ty, you're not going to believe what I'm about to tell you.
 Sorry. Slight misunderstanding.
 You were right. She was compelling me, but only because she wanted to talk about Katherine and she knew I was pissed at her. I guess they didn't really settle their mother/daughter issues before she died.
 Yeah. She knew you would go after her if you knew she was frying my mind. I guess she's got that whole 'stone cold' survival thing going on? Like mother, like daughter.
 Yep. I plan on it.
 You call me if she gives you any more hassle.
 I took care of it.
 I said I took care of it. Earlier on the phone, you weren't talking to Elena. You were talking to someone who needed information.
 Your boyfriend once planted himself inside my brain. That's how you were planning on saving Katherine.  She didn't die, did she? She jumped inside Elena.
 Yeah. What are you going to do with me?
 It'll be fine. I just need to convince my friends I'm okay. I'll keep your secret. No one has to die.
 Caroline.. What are you doing here?
 It's a long story. Nadia, come on in.
 I was on my way out of town and then there she was, sitting on the front steps, waiting for me.
 Uh... I lost it the first night.
 One drink led to three and that led to five and.. uh.. the rest is kind of a blur.
 Caroline! I'm wearing vervain. She's not compelling me.
 I told you, she's not compelling me. We're having fun.
 Uhh..
 So. I'm curious, we've spent a couple of days together now...
 Canoodling. Exactly. It seems like you went through all this trouble to save your Mom, but she only seems interested in Stefan.
 Yeah, but you did expect something
 Look, I've been where you are. My mom use to disappear for weeks at a time and then show up one day out of the blue and pretend like nothing happened. Before you know it, I'd be at the stove, making her a grilled cheese.
 Isn't it? She decides when you're worth it, on her watch, but guess what, you're never going to be as interesting as the next guy she wants to sleep with.
 You are if you think Katherine's going to choose you. She's not.
 Wait.. Since I'm going to forget this anyway...
 Thank you. If I'm going to be threatened and held against my will, I can think of worse scenarios.
 What'd you expect? Elena's my best friend. I'll always protect her.
 And I still am. And so are you. You could've killed me this morning and you didn't. You're not like her and you know it.
 Yeah. Why? What's going on in here?
 Nadia STOP!
 Wait a second... Does anyone want to tell me how this is my fault?!
 Hang on here.. Katherine's still alive? How is that possible?
 I still have the knife Nadia gave me.
 What do you mean, you bit her?
 And you're just mentioning this now?
 Which means...?
 You think?
 Huh?
 
 
 Your hands are like ice.
 No, it's Matt, I'm not...
 
 
 Shh.
  Oh, well...
 Screw that.
 She deserves better.
 No, I got this.
 About time, too.
 Take it off!
 Elena.. what are you talking about?
 Yeah, which is more than we can say for Aaron Whitmore. Weren't he and Elena tight?
 Does she know that Damon killed him?
 *unintelligible*
 Chill! I'm right here! What?
 What? too much sexting with Elena?
 JEREMY!
 Don't do it, Jeremy.
 Let me guess, this is about Elena?
 If you wanted advice, why didn't you just talk to Stefan?
 I'm only listening to you because I'm getting paid.
 Cliffnotes – Liv goes to Whitmore, she's a new witch and Bonnie's teaching her magic.
 You're the one with the vamp ears. What are they talking about?
 Hmm
 We're friends of Jeremy and Elena.
 Oh and don't forget Bonnie. She's the one who told us you might be here.
 So you want us to stab ourselves?
 Again, you want us to stab ourselves?
 Says the hunter with the Traveler-proof head.
 And the hybrid, who heals.
 No. Why?
 Yeah, of course.
 Checking on the sheriff, but she's not here. I know it's probably nothing, but if I were gonna take over a town 
 I can't do anything until you bring the Traveler knife, so hurry up.
 Sheriff, hey.
 Uh, Caroline. She said you missed lunch, so I told her I'd check up on you.
 Did I? Maybe you misheard.
 I'm dead, bon, but the sheriff's in trouble.
 Just tell Jeremy. He'll know what I mean. I'm sorry to do this to you, Bon.
 Can you see me?
 Are you a witch?
 Then how?
 Yeah, I know who you are. I thought the whole point of this place was to live out your afterlife in solitude. Why can I see you?
 Vicki.
 She's my sister. She's over here. If I can see you,then that means I can see her.
 Vicki! Vicki! Vick! How am I back here?
 Vick?
 I'm here now. It's ok.
 I'm not leaving you, ok? We're getting out of here. Take my hand.
 Take my hand!
 Vicki! Vicki!
 I won't let you go!
 Vicki! Vick!
 Where'd she go? Did she move on? Did she find peace? Because it certainly didn't look like that.
 It doesn't matter. When I go back, I'm not gonna remember any of this.
 I know. I remember.
 One second, I was holding Vick.
 She pushed me away, and then  And then she just disappeared. What's going on over there, Bon?
 Not mine. I actually do my laundry. It's not in the floor safe.
 Are you sure Tyler hid it where he said he did?
 We can hear you just fine from there.
 That's gonna be a problem.
 As in it's not here.
 And we're stuck here because Damon said he'd twist off our kneecaps if we left.
 No. I'm glad you're ok, Bon.
 Don't look at me. This is all Ty.
 Ty, once this guy pops out, we have no idea when you'll come back again.
 Ok. Let's do this. Vyjit.
 Where's Markos?
 To answer your question, my name is Matt, and you, julian, are inside my best friend, aka your own personal hell.
 There's plenty more where that came from. Where's Markos?
 You're right. I don't plan on killing you, but I do plan on getting my answers. Where's Markos?
 So?
 Ty, what's wrong?
 Why don't you do us all a favor and start dating Elena again.
 Elena! Hey! What happened?
 What?!
 The tunnels! They're in the stockroom. Come on. Let's go.
 Elena!
 What's going on?
 Alright. Come on, let's keep running. Maybe we'll stay ahead of it.
 There are all of the blood-bags I can get my hands on.
 I'll send you a picture right now.
 We can't blow up our hometown.
 Can we talk about the irony in us blowing up the only place dumb enough to hire us?
 Yeah, if they can come home. No one said killing the Travelers will get rid of this anti-magic thing, although Mystic Falls might be a half-decent place to live in again. No more vampire attacks, crazy blood rituals, you know? Safe like it use to be.
 There are worse things than having to visit your girlfriend at college on the weekends, Jer. It's called "normal."
 Alright. It's 7 o'clock on the dot.  Let's go.
 The main-gas line is off, Jer... Jer...
 I don't know. He's probably doing homework or something.
 Yeah, I'll deal with him.
 So, this is it, huh? Video games. Random girls. Drunk by noon every day. Look, it sucks that Bonnie's dead, Jer. I get it, but you need to start living your life again.
 For now. But Caroline's working on a way to reverse all that. So, it's only a matter of time before we're dealing with all the problems that come along with vampires again. You're a hunter. You have skills. Use them.
 Yeah, you're right, Jer. You're not much of anything anymore.
 Are you okay? It's OK.
 You're OK, calm down.
 She had a dog. It bit her. She was lost. She stopped to ask this
 We're just meeting up with my friend here. Everything will be fine.
 Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you.
 Look, I know you're scared, and I'm sorry that this happened to you, but all I can do is promise that it won't happen again.
 Because I've been attacked like that more times than I can count. I've had my throat ripped open. I've had my neck snapped, my hand smashed. I've drowned. I've died and come back to life. And I've lost what little family I had, and I refuse to lose anyone else. I want to protect people like you. Like us.
 Jer! Come on, we're going to be 
 This isn't Jer's house.
 Yeah, why don't you do that.
 Why would you bring her here? You shouldn't be anywhere near her, dumbass. Not after what happened yesterday.
 Not a big deal? Right, I forgot. You don't care about anything.
 What about Caroline?
 A little early for that, don't ya think?
 I meant in life.
 Where's Sarah?
 Tripp, hey. I'm just blowing off some steam, what's up?
 Yeah, at my house. I'm not sure how that happened.
 No, she split, why?
 You're kidding.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I will.
 Shh, we've got a little problem. Sarah's shady, the plates on her car are stolen, she's gotta go.
 Look no offense, but you've gotta find someplace else to stay.
 Seriously, Jer? I'm on the community protection committee and she's a car thief.
 You can't leave, I told Elena that I'd watch out for you.
 Wait, you're from Mystic Falls?
 Which family?
 So if you're a founding family, that means you know all the stuff that go along with it, right?
 Yeah, sure.
 What did Alaric do to her?
 All I know is she doesn't remember what she saw in Damon and we're supposed to keep it that way.
 Look, I gotta go. I'll see you later.
 It's a little early for a car wash.
 My friends are having a party, and I'd like to go by this afternoon after lunch.
 Oh, I don't know.
 Yeah, I know what he means.
 Yeah. I may be driving, but if you puke in my truck, I'm gonna kill you.
 Why do you keep calling her that... dog bite girl?
 What's up, Ty?
 Jay, back off.
 Whoa, Jay! Jay, what you're doing right now, definition of a douchebag.
 Yeah. Sorry.
 I didn't even know he was back.
 My buddy's wasted, and I've got to train in the morning, so...
 Yeah.
 What the hell does it matter? It's a keg.
 Oh, is that when you lent Liv your manhood?
 What the hell did you do?
 Stake?
 No. No, no. That's not possible.
 Yeah. Maybe Jay, who I've known since I was 10, somehow became a vampire hunter on his own. I'm such an idiot. I spent all summer training with a founding family member, thinking that he was only worried about protecting old ladies from getting mugged.
 It's a little complicated.
 Is he seriously still wasted?
 I'm on my way to Tripp's office now. I think I can get him to trust me and tell me what he knows.
 Tripp, are you okay?
 I heard. Do you know what happened?
 I-I don't know. He was drunk... I offered to give him a ride home, and he said he'd walk. I should have driven him home.
 Wait. Maybe I should go with you. I mean, I might have been the last person to see Jay alive.
 You and the Sheriff. Don't seem to get along.
 You're married?
 Sorry.
 So, what did you tell the Sheriff about Jay?
 Just another animal attack, huh?
 This is gonna sound weird.... but, last night, Jay told me that he was tracking a vampire. I mean that's crazy, right?
 What is this place?
 Ooh, my bad.
 I'll pass.
 Sorry. If Stefan turned you in, I'm guessing you deserved it.
 Still, I think the general population is safer with you in here.
 Honestly, I didn't know anybody was missing him.
 I'm sorry! I was confused about which vampires we like and which ones we don't!
 Tripp drove her and two others across the border last night.
 He's running down another lead, but he didn't tell me what it was.
 If Enzo talks, it'll be you guys.
 Sarah? What are you doing?
 You can't be in here.
 What do you want?
 Not really...
 So, you thought breaking in here was a good idea?
 Animal attacks are filed over there.
 So, where do you come from?
 It's locked
 Hey, Care. Did you get him?
 Caroline, we have another problem  Tripp has Ivy's phone.
 Yeah, but your name is at the top of the "recent dialed" list.
 I'm guessing he knows where to find you.
 Yeah, I thought I'd save you the trouble of having to boost another car.
 If I told you I knew about your family, promise to take a little friendly advice?
 Read any history book about this town's founding members. The guys that live in this house are Damon and Stefan Salvatore.
 Because... They're vampires, and wherever they go, death and pain always follow. So, if you're looking for family, you're not going to find it here. Do yourself a favor, and get as far away from this place as you can.
 Jer-
 You went after my friends. What'd you expect?
 Don't be a dick. You know, you can dry the vervain out of him, compel him to forget everything, and he'll never set foot in Mystic Falls again.
 I'm not on the wrong side, man. My side's just really freaking complicated.
 What?
 That's your idea of being on the right side?
 Caroline, stop! The border.
 Ok. Let's do this. Let her go, and you can have him.
 Are you ok?
 What the hell did you do?
 I can't. It's for Bonnie.
 You'll get used to it.
 That's not gonna happen because I won't let it.
 And with that, the Mystic Falls community protection program is officially disbanded.
 Relax.
 Enzo, what the hell are you doing here?
 The guy who killed Tripp.
 Enzo, leave.
 Or maybe I'll pick up where Tripp left off.
 Everyone hates you.
 Hey. Where you guys going?
 All right.
 I told you she's his family. If they want to talk, let them talk. What the hell do you care?
 Or you just hate Stefan.
 Yeah, because you kill people.
 Hey! You ok?
 You compelled her? Why?
 Enzo, what are you doing?
 Enzo, let her go, or I swear 
 I will kill you.
 No!
 A monster. Yeah, I know, but you could have stopped him, and you didn't.
 I don't know actually. You're not exactly the sharing type.
 So we're just supposed to trust that you know best?
 The problem is you are, because no matter how close vampires get to humans, our lives will always mean less, so when push comes to shove, we'll be on opposite sides, which is what Tripp knew and I didn't.
 Don't do that.
 Because I think channeling your rage might be a better option. How do you feel about being a hunter again?
 Because I want you to help me kill Enzo.
 Haven't seen him.
 Still no idea.
 Yeah, got it. If we see him, we'll let you know.
 It was Damon. Apparently, there's a psychopath roaming Mystic Falls.
 Must have forgot to mention it. Look. You better get out of here. Enzo's gonna be here soon.
 I'm giving you information about a girl who's supposed to be Stefan's long lost niece. I'm not exactly interested in him finding out.
 Monique. Her name was Monique.
 She knew something that Stefan didn't want her to know, and for some screwed up reason, you're obsessed with knowing Stefan's secrets. Probably because he has everything you'll never have.
 Because I want this obsession to take you the hell away from here. This is all the information Monique told me about her past. Take it and get out.
 Yeah, but he wouldn't suffer. Get the door.
 He just killed an innocent girl, Jer. He deserves to suffer.
 You mean the guy whose neck Enzo slit open for trying to protect innocent people?
 Maybe that's the problem, Jer. We've all been looking the other way because we're friends with vampires, but how many people need to die for us to face the fact that vampires also kill people?
 Just help me get him to the van.
 Then what are you waiting for? Go ahead and kill me.
 What do you want, Enzo?
 I came in to do inventory and found him like this. Sorry to bother you on your day off, Sheriff, but 
 22 hours and 18 minutes. That's how long supernatural beings have been allowed back in Mystic Falls and I already know someone who's dead because of it.
 This is never gonna end, is it? The attacks, the cover-ups? This is our life again.
 Woah, woah, hey. Sheriff, you okay?
 Hey, there you are. We were just about to watch another movie.
 Anytime. See you soon, Sheriff.
 So I'm guessing you didn't
 Why do you even care?
 So I help you destroy some
 Screw you! I'm not gonna be
 I got it. (walks over
 Hey. I saw your camera. I'm
 A little bit of everything.
 No. No, I don't. Sorry.
 Oh, yeah? What's the first?
 No. It's ok. I get it.
 Thanks.
 I tried, ok?
 I have no idea who that is.
 Virginia. Mystic Falls.
 Great. My buddy bailed on me,
 Oh, that'd be great. I'm I'm
 Too bad my wallet's in my
 Thank you.
 What was the point of this?
 So what... you're gonna compel
 What are you
 I'm here, aren't I? Where's Tyler?
 To you, brother.
 Nothing you need to worry about. Hey, it's Jeremy's going-away party. Whatever you want, it can wait a day.
 What the hell does that...
 What are you doing here?
 You're welcome.
 Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
 No. These are great. I'll just send these over to my manager. Whoa, too far.
 Anyone ever tell you you're a really good photographer?
 Who did? Uh, whoa. Never mind. It's none of my business. This is gonna come as a shock to you, but this is not a good time.
 Yeah? What are you gonna do to her?
 If you want to meet her, come here.
 Oh, is this the part where you threaten my mom again? Because that's brave.
 I'm hanging up now.
 What the hell did you do?
 Hey, would you rather take more pictures of potato skins? I thought you were into dark subject matter.
 This is Mystic Falls. This is about as dark as it gets.
 Heh heh. (Beep)
 All right. We're here. Where the hell are you?
 No. I can't.
 Ooh! Matt! (Coughing)
 You need to get out of here.
 Fix it.
 
 
 Sure, Care. Whatever you need.
 There you are. You're late.
 Are you drunk?
 You're not going in there.
 I'm sorry about you and LIv. I know you've been going through a lot of crap, but Caroline does not deserve you bringing it here.
 I'm not. I'm glad you pulled it together. The thing is, Ty, I get it, alright? We've all been through so much that it's bound to make us a little crazy. But I was thinking, you know, watching the way all those cops honored her today, I want to be a part of something like that. So I talked to one of the deputies, and he gave me an application. There's this, uh, officer training program. Seems pretty cool, you know, like something I'm supposed to be a part of. I got one for you too.
 Guy was out for twenty seconds!
 
 
 We should get out of here.
 You're sick.
 That's a trick question. You don't have a favorite color.
 No, you didn't.
 What are you doing?
 Alright, Ty, stop. He will kill you. 
 Ty, stop!
 
 No.
 
 Where's Jo? 
 Help!
 
 Do you know how many times I've died, or nearly died? Most of those times were at the hands of people I thought were my friends. 
 Don't give me the "we're not all like that" speech, Elena, because you are. Just one flip of a switch away.
 I can't say that I hate vampires, and then use them when it's to my advantage. I can't have it both ways, Elena. That's just how it is to me.
 Hey. Can I assume that the woman who looks like she's never been in a restaurant before is your lunch date?
 So, what do you want me to do?
 Okay.
 Thanks to Stefan and Caroline, I can barely tie my shoe at the moment. What, are you here to stalk someone?
 I can't have any trouble here, man.
 So you two know each other?
 She's gone.
 I couldn't. She was with Enzo.
 I don't know, but you better hurry up.
 Bonnie, are you okay?
 HAPPY BACHELOR PARTY!
 Well, considering the guy who lives here tried to kill us a few days ago, I don't blame you.
 
 You chose now to learn math?
 Who the hell invited you?
 Don't know, don't care.
 
 How's the deputy training program?
 
 Maybe that's because Deputy Taylor's on medical leave for a week after you kicked his ass in front of the trainees!
 
 It doesn't have to be like that, Ty.
 You just need some self-control.
 Control it, Ty.
 So, you're really doing this, huh? Taking the plunge, starting a family here?
 Want some drunk advice?
 
 
 Okay, we got suits.
 Seriously, just one! You can't even look after this.
 Yeah! Actually, you should probably lock this down while you still can.
 Wedding day chores.
 Okay. Truck's here. Who's coming?
 Caroline suggested in a semi-threatening way that I pick up the centerpieces, which sounds like a Donovan screw-up waiting to happen.
 Thank you.
 Yeah. She killed two people last week when she wasn't desiccating.
 Here.
 When Bonnie Bennett has a hunch, you don't ignore it.
 I know what we shouldn't do  leave her in the hands of two people we don't trust.
 I thought the whole point of this is that we were in control of her.
 All we have to do is knock her ass out and drag her to the boiler room. Thirty minutes, tops.
 Bonnie?
 I can't breathe. It's like someone is crushing my throat
 Bonnie?
 Hey.
 Ty?
 Ty, what's wrong?
 No.
 No. I'm not doing this.
 I'm glad one of us can find humor in this.
 Bonnie, let's go. We got to get to the hospital.
 What's wrong?
 What is that?
 What is this?
 Oh, my god.
 You have to get out of town now, Bon.
 Bon, Elena's the only thing that Damon Salvatore cares about. He'll kill you. You have to get out of here now.
 There, I did it. Are you happy?
 So, I'm a cop, huh?
 You know, there's a good chance that I'll never see you again.
 One victim had bite wounds, and the other one was scorched beyond recognition.
 Hey, Caroline  we should really get going to that barbeque.
 
 Care, we should really go.
 
 
 
 
 Bonnie, hey!
 I didn't know you were back.
 They had been stopped, Bon, back in 1903. But then, you betrayed Kai, he let them out, and I got to bury all my buddies from the Sheriff's department.
 
 Look, I gotta go patrol.
 Let him go.
 I said, let him go!
 AHHH!
 
 
 
 Bon, please tell me that that's not the plan...
 
 But won't it reset when I wake up?
 
 
 
 Awfully long ten seconds, Bon.
 
 
 
 I drive up and down these streets every day. Streets that, for my entire life, were filled with families, kids... And now, I pray that I see empty parks, and empty playgrounds. I pray that I don't see a soul, and I hate that. I hate them.
 Besides violating a town-wide quarantine and putting these people's lives at risk to make a quick buck? Pack it up and get out of here.
 Get out of here, unless you want your license suspended. Now.
 If you touch any of these people, I will shoot you right here.
 
 
 
 
 I'm going with you.
 
 Hey. This is off-limits to...
 You're one of the Heretics.
 Right now, there's a tour bus full of corpses in the cemetery because I didn't do anything stupid.
 
 One... two...
 It's Matt. We lost all formalities when you and your girlfriend drained me of all my blood.
 Got a better idea  why don't you convince your family to leave Mystic Falls?
 Why would a group of vampires hang around an abandoned town with nothing to eat?
 
 Uh, what was that about?
 This'll only take a minute. I'll meet you at my truck.
 So, Nora showed me where they keep the good stuff.
 
 Alright, everybody. Please stand up. We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
 Bonnie and I found two dozen people compelled to hang out at the high school last night. I've been trying to call her, but she won't pick up. I'm starting to get a little worried.
 
 We had to tranquilize them just to get them out of there, but they were all back this morning like they never left.
 
 I found more at the courthouse and another dozen at the supermarket.
 Saline... to keep them hydrated. Which you'd only need if you were gonna keep them here for a while.
 Problem is I can't find a single bite mark on any of them, which is somehow creepier. They're not being fed on. They're being fed.
 I found these in the trashcan. This is salmon, steak. Iron-rich foods  probably to boost their red blood cell count. It's like someone's fattening the cattle for the slaughter.
 Whoa, Care. Hey. Um... Are you okay?
 
 ...So you're a vampire with food poisoning?
 
 What's that supposed to mean?
 What?
 You sure you don't want to talk about this whole Valerie baby-spell thing?
 Care, I've never seen you puke before.
 
 
 
 Breaking news  remember all those people Julian was stockpiling? They disappeared this morning.
 That's what I'm working on. You want to cut class today and help me get to the bottom of it?
 Wait, you're really pregnant?
 How did Stefan take it?
 Hey! Let her go.
 What the hell is wrong with you?
 Yeah, why don't you tell that to the girl whose throat you were about to tear out?
 Damon didn't want you, Lily didn't want you, and this town never wanted you. So what are you still doing here?
 Save your strength. You're full of vervain. You couldn't break out of here on your best day.
 I took your advice. You see, you're right. I can't protect Mystic Falls on my own, so I made some friends who could help.
 Sorry, I can't tell you. See, they'd like to introduce themselves. I guess I was wrong. Someone wanted you after all.
 If Julian were in Mystic Falls, I think I'd know.
 All I'm saying is the guy's not shy about making himself known.
 
 
 
 DAMON!
 What's wrong? Damon text-bombing you empty apologies?
 Oh, that's smart. Until Damon manipulates Stefan into thinking he's changed and then he's our problem again.
 
 
 Oh, you wish, Mystic Queen.
 Yeah, I was in my uniform. I'm not gonna crop my gun out.
 At least Lily kept her Heretics on leash. I guess it's safe to say I lost my soft side.
 I made a helmet!
 Yeah, "almost" being the operative word.
 I can't. I'm on duty.
 So, that's it, huh? You're just gonna give up? We grew up there, Ty. That is your town.
 
 So, you want to tell me what the Heretic's doing here?
 
 
 Yeah, perhaps you should.
 
 Damnit!
 Oh, man...
 Officer, look... I'm a cop, too, if you let me just show you my badge.
 
 
 I think I'll wait it out.
 
 Thanks.
 Yeah. That's the way it seems.
 
 
 You can go now.
 You already did what we needed.
 You're the easiest way to get to Stefan. Don't take it personally.
 
 
 
 People have a lot of spare time on their hands.
 Anything else, Officer Ares?
 Thanks.
 What do you mean?
 Do you know what street Doug lives on?
 Hello? Anyone home?
 Hello? Doug, are you at home?
 
 Put the gun down. You need to leave now.
 Wooden bullets. If you're gonna wear a uniform in Mystic Falls, you need wooden bullets.
 
 I think that's enough for one night.
 
 Caroline's safe. I got her out. She's with Ric now. Damon's still inside. I managed to disable the security cameras so no one can see out here, but I'm worried the ones on the roof are on a different circuit.
 All right, I did it. He's out. Now I never see you again, right?
 No one knows where he is, either. He's not taking anyone's calls, and I can't triangulate his cell phone without at least knowing 
 
 If I can narrow the search, we have a chance, but until I know the general vicinity of either of them, I have nothing to track.
 Let me call you back.
 Tell me you at least appreciate the irony. I need your help because there's no Sheriff's department left. The reason there's no Sheriff's department is because you killed all the sheriffs.
 
 Dispatch just put an APB on a speeding motorcyclist traveling east on Highway 90. Woman, meets Rayna's description, driving like a maniac.
 
 He's got a thick jacket on. I can't exactly see where his heart is.
 You gonna stand there and brag all day, or are you gonna help me load him into the car? We gotta get him out of here before the 
 
 
 
 Yes.
 Kind of. It's complicated.
 
 Exactly.
 Stefan... I mean, not right now, but...
 I do 
 
 This won't take long.
 
 Vampires need to leave Mystic Falls... for good. All of you.
 This is footage from the Grill today... of Damon doing some very not-human things to Rayna. I've got footage of you, too. Hundreds of hours from the town surveillance system. Now... I don't want to show it to anyone or expose you...
 Yeah, I am. And I hate that. I hate that I have to threaten my friend because he's a vampire. I hate that I'm friends with vampires at all. This isn't about me. Or you. This is about our home, which has been destroyed time and time again. This is the only way to break that cycle. You have until the end of the day. Damon, too.
 Get up.
 All right, I did it. He's out. Now, I never see you again, right?
 Hey, Martel. What's up? I got your text. I owe you for calling off the alert on the whole hostage hoax, so whatever you want, man.
 Why are you even in Dallas?
 
 
 I did it.
 I made Stefan pay for what he did.
 Just like I promised you.
 Hello?
 Rayna?
 You put Stefan back in the Stone?
 Then we have nothing to talk about. I did my part. I'm out.
 
 Rayna? What do you mean, "free?"
 I'm calling to warn you 
 I know you're gonna find this hard to believe, but I made sure that Caroline was safe.
 
 Look, something bad happened, and I'm calling to warn you that I sent some visitors your way.
 
 I'm driving.
 With no traffic, we should be in Spartanburg in under two hours.
 Second best decision I ever made.
 Nothing.
 It's not important.
 Hey.
 Pretty sure this isn't gonna make the list.
 Uh, all right, I guess the only surprise is if... to see if I got the size right. Are you rethinking your "yes"?
 How about on a sergeant's salary?
 It's not official yet. But they mayor tipped me off. "Sergeant Donovan." It's got a nice ring to it, right?
 When I got home from the funeral, our wedding invitations were sitting on the doorstep.
 Lost control of her truck. Hit a tree. That's the official story, anyway.
 But you and I both know that's not what really happened.
 I think Rayna's GPS is off. I don't know why a vampire would want to hide out around so much sharp wood.
 Little things just didn't add up. There were no tire marks on the road. The more I dug, the less sense it made.
 But she didn't show, did she?
 Thanks.
 No, we're not. I don't think you meant to hurt Penny, but you know what happened to her. I couldn't make sense of my memories from that night, and then... I checked the footage on my dash-cam.
 You compelled me. I'm guessing I don't need to tell you what you said to me.
 Now you're gonna tell me the truth.
 Was it self-defense? Caroline didn't show up, so you needed to take it out on someone else?
 Then just tell me what happened.
 I need to know. (He drops the gun and rips off his vervain bracelet.)
 Please. I need... to know the truth.
 Penny, you copy?
 Penny?
 Stefan?
 Penny!
 Penny. Stefan!
   Hey, you-you have to drink. Come on, come on, you have to drink. Penny, come on, you have to drink, please. Stay with me. Come on, drink.
 No.
 Penny?
 I killed her.
 I killed her.
 I released Rayna and helped her kidnap Caroline to punish you for something I did.
 I don't. I blame you. I may have pulled the trigger, but none of this would have happened if you hadn't come back. Why couldn't you have just stayed away from us?
 Yeah, it turns out it was an accident. 
 No, I'll take care of it.
 It's sheriff now. You got a lot of balls coming back to Mystic Falls.
 Those rules are the last shred of what my fiancée and I built together.
 She wouldn't be in this situation if it weren't for you and Damon... It's an endless cycle. Penny knew that. She knew that we needed to take a stand.
 Not until you hear what I have to say. I couldn't get in your head, so I've been waiting out here to do it the normal way.
 
 I came here to talk you out of murdering our friends, not lend a hand because I do know you, Bonnie. 
 I'm in. Now get in the truck, and we'll drive somewhere safe. 
 What's that? 
 
 Those shots bought us eight hours to get Bonnie as far away from the rest of you as I can. I don't want to waste a second of it talking to you.
 I did it for her, not for you. Even if you absolved her of killing you, she'd never forgive herself... I'd never forgive myself.
 Is my fault. And I'll be paying for it the rest of my life, starting with taking responsibility for Bonnie. So if you want to thank me, figure out a way to fix her.
 
 So what's it like when you see them?
 Then untie me. Let me help you, okay? I can stop you.
 No, she can't! (Matt is struggling with the bindings on his wrist.)
 Just stuck. How about you? Are you okay?
 They'd be dead too, Bonnie. They're marked. If you die, they die.
 It's okay. I stopped you. I can keep stopping you.
 No, no, no, no. Don't you leave me, Bonnie.
 Bonnie!
 )Hello. I'm hurt and I need help. Is anyone out there?
 Penny...this isn't real.
 I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...
 I just can't escape this life.
 I just want to be with you. Please take me with you?
 Dad. Don't move, don't move. Let me see it. All right, look, it's not that bad, okay? Just keep some pressure on it, you're gonna be fine.
 Look, you're gonna be fine if you do exactly as I say.
 I need you to drink his blood.
 I'll explain later, but right now I need you to trust me, okay? Drink.
 I told you I'll explain everything. But first I need to understand why Damon was trying to hurt you.
 I'm telling you that I know him. He's not dead. Not exactly. I know. None of this makes any sense, and I know. I tracked you down a few months ago and I didn't tell you about any of this. Okay, I'm sorry, but I promise, if you go to the truck right now, I'll explain everything. I just don't want you to see what happens next.
 Why not? That seems to be your solution for everything. Maybe I should give it a shot.
 You're right, Damon, I am desperate. And for once, I don't care about your drama. I don't give a damn if you shut your humanity off. All I want to know is why you tried to kill my father.
 Shut up, I'm done playing games.
 Not even you're that stupid. Humanity or not, nobody'd forgive you for that. Especially Elena.
 You're lying. Last time I knew, Tyler was up in, uh...
 If you hurt Tyler, I swear to God, I will kill you.
 It's because of that watch I gave you. It's full of something called vervain.
 Yeah. How'd you know that?
 Honestly, we all should've got out of that town when we had the chance.
 Humanity or not, nobody would forgive you for that.
 Yeah. Just, uh, put it down. I'll go through it later. Box everything up. Room by room.
 No, it's fine. I'm an expert at dealing with loss, you know? Started at a young age.
 You do and you don't. I'm sorry. It's just... Tyler and this place and the fact that I have vampire blood in my system. And if I die in the next 24 hours, I'm gonna become one.
 "All this"? What do you mean? Like vampires and vervain and... and death? This was my life. This is what I dealt with. Alone. For a long time. This is what I wanted to escape. So, forgive me if I'm not in the mood to give you a history lesson.
 You don't want to know.
 Tyler was helping this girl named Virginia St. John locate the sirens who escaped the vault. Well, she had all this research and letters and stuff from her great-grandfather, Dalton. He released one of the sirens in 1883. Then Virginia died and she willed all this to Tyler. Then he died. And now...
 I'm not the right guy for the job. Okay? I-I ran away. I left, you know? Tyler knew that.
 He cared about all of us. And he was my best friend.
 I just wish it were under better circumstances. I'm sorry that I've been M.I.A. I've just been going through some stuff.
 So how are the girls? Practically teenagers.
 Seline?
 No, Caroline, you need to get home now.
 Caroline, you need to get home now.
 I'm not exactly in the loop anymore, but don't worry, tips are about to start flying.
 You tell me. He's your brother.
 Why?
 A state cop called in the minivan's plates from that location.
 Nothing yet. He's unconscious. Stefan's still trying.
 I gave Ric and Caroline the address to the motel. They're on their way there now.
 When was the last time you ate something?
 You won't. Think about it. That siren absolutely erased Damon. She found whatever was good inside him and crushed it. Then she tried doing the same thing to Enzo and he fought back. Survived and escaped.
 He will. He's a tough b*st*rd.
 Is Stefan there?
 What is it?
 Hey, I don't know what you want me to do with all this stuff.
 Yeah, no problem.
 It doesn't take a crazy person to want to kill someone for threatening their kids.
 You know, even I have a threshold for how much pain I can watch my friends go through... how hard they have to fight. Sometimes it makes me want to fight back, you know?
 Hey! He's had enough, okay? Just finish him.
 Hey. Surprise, surprise.
 Uh. apparently, the Mystic Grill wasn't good enough for this guy.
 Why are you doing this?
 To murder innocent people?
 I never killed...
 I never murdered anyone.
 Back off.
 None of your business, Damon.
 Slow news day?
 Raincheck. I'm on my way out to the Armory to deliver the St. John box that Tyler left behind. Just doing Ric a favor. You doing okay?
 I'll tell you what. If you sneak into Coach Lyman's office and write something really rude in his playbook, drinks are on me tonight at the Grill.
 Dealer's choice.
  Ugh! I do not miss that sound.
 Happy embedding.
 Anybody here? Hello?
 Yeah. Ric said you'd be in charge while he was on his sabbatical.
 Welcome to the circle of trust.
 You mean the tuning fork?
 If you say so.
 Oh! Awesome.
 No.
 That's his specialty.
 Yeah, I'd say he was obsessed with her. He even measured her for a crown.
 You got a really low bar for "cool."
 Wait, we have an estate?
 One more thing to be proud of.
 I'm with him right now. You sound stressed. You okay?
 Wait, slow down, you lost me after "I'm fine."
 Wait, when was this?
 Yeah, that makes sense.
 Wickery Bridge is where Elena's parents drove the car off the road. When the sheriffs dredged out the car, they found something else... The old charter bell. It was broken, but they saved it.
 No, your mom had it in storage. I only know this because I cleaned out her office after the funeral.
 Caroline, don't do it. You need to get away from her.
 What kids? Where are you?
 They know it's urgent. They'll call as soon as they hear from the bus company. Besides, we know Sybil's field trip was headed near Mystic Falls. We're going in the right direction.
 Says the guy who threw it off the bridge. I mean, what were you thinking, anyway?
 What?
 So you wanted to get the parade cancelled? Classy.
 About the sirens?
 Yeah, I gotta call you back.
 She's not gonna listen to you. None of them will. Sybil's controlling them. Help me untie 'em, now.
 It's okay. You finished your assignment. Sybil's done with all of you now.
 A bus just picked the kids up. They didn't remember a thing. I told them there was a carbon monoxide leak on their way here and that their old bus was getting towed.
 Yeah, I know a lot about making excuses.
 You know what? Growing up, out of all my friends, I was the only one whose family didn't have a legacy in Mystic Falls, so I felt like an outsider in my own town. And then I find out our family has a history, after all. That could've changed everything for me... but you never gave me a chance to know about it.
 Welcome to the circle of trust.
 No, your mom had it in storage.
 Hey, Care. I'm here with Dorian.
 That's "yes" in Nerdish.
 I don't like the sound of that.
 Yeah, we're on it. (he ends the phone call)
 I have a plan.
 Here's the only thing you need to focus on  payback.
 I wasn't breaking and entering. I was checking on a friend's house. This whole thing is a big misunderstanding.
 It's former sheriff, but yeah, thank you.
 This is gonna sound crazy, but, um, a bell. Yeah, apparently the town's been using a fake charter bell since 1992 and I'm just trying to find the real one. What are you doing?
 You're guarding it, aren't you?
 Sheriff.
 Hey, you don't have to listen to that voice inside your head that's telling you to protect that thing.
 I know.
 If you want to make it up to me, radio your guys and tell them to get as far away from here as possible so I can steal that thing. Okay.
 Stop right there.
 Oh, you're not sirened, you're just plain stupid? I thought the point of stealing this thing was to keep it a secret.
 Get in the truck and leave her behind.
 You know what? Growing up, out of my family and friends, I was the only one whose family didn't have a legacy in Mystic Falls. That could've changed everything for me.
 Knock it off, I'm a civilian now.
 Who is she?
 Where's the actual sheriff?
 One second.
 This isn't a good time.
 I just had my dad take it out of town to hide it. Why?
 What? That's crazy, Care.
 What she wants is the only weapon that can kill her. I mean, if we give it to her, how are we gonna stop her?
 Yeah, well, maybe that's what he deserves.
 Yeah, actually I do, Care. I'm standing at a crime scene right now where a bunch of people are dead. And one of them is Violet Fell.
 Are you? 'Cause no matter how many innocent people die, all anyone's ever concerned about is Stefan and Damon.
 I told the Fells I'd help pick out a plot for their daughter. I've done it before so...
 No, it isn't. But while you're here, Dad, do you even remember Vicki?
 You're not the only one responsible. What if I told you the person who killed Vicki was suffering right now and that that bell could either save him or make sure he keeps being punished.
 I'm not doing this for you.
 Just tell me how this works.
 There's gotta be more to it than that. What are you not telling me? Why do we have to ring it?
 Since when do you care about people dying?
 Hey, that wasn't part of the deal.
 All of us and Mystic Falls.
 You're not destroying our town.
 You're forgetting one small detail. You need a Maxwell to ring that bell and I'm not touching it.
 If you compel me, you're making the choice for me and all that blood would be on your hands, not mine. So how badly do you want me to go to Hell?
 What's that supposed to mean?
 Not in the next 10 minutes. Probably not ever. Ok, look, I need you to get out of here. Go to the cops and save as many people as you can, ok. There's no reason both of us have to die.
 Here's the difference, Dad, I want you to abandon me this time. Cos when I ring that bell all hell"s gonna break loose, literally.
 No, Dad, you'll be damned if you don't.
 Don't you get it, Dad, I will go through you, I'm compelled. I'm ringing that bell. Unless you kill me.
 You have to kill me. No matter what you do, I'll keep coming. I'll probably kill you in the process. Please, Dad, I'll die a hero. My life will mean something.
 You've been a crap father your whole life, why stop now?
 C'mon, Dad, do something.
 C'mon, Dad, do something please. Dad, get up. Nine, ten. Dad, you're gonna have to kill me. Dad, c'mon. Eleven, please.
 I forgive you.
 Like I just had my head rammed into a large metal object.
 Well, since Stefan compelled me to ring the bell by 9pm. I'd say we're in the clear. For the record, it's hard to thank you for something's that pretty much your fault.
 Let me guess, your emotions are back on, huh.
 Well, you did just save my father and pretty much the entire town so it counts for something in my book.
 Not by a long shot. But you keep on like the way you did tonight, I'm not ruling anything out.
 Nah, gonna stop by the police department. Hear Mystic Falls needs a sheriff.
 All of us in Mystic Falls.
 You need a Maxwell to ring that bell, and I'm not touching it.
 Welcome, everybody. As part of our ramp-up to Founder's Day, our high school students have followed up on a local legend about a time capsule buried in 1790. With the help of our historical society, they went digging for treasure. And this is what they found. 
 Yeah, this morning's been a real mess. I got called into a fight at a coffee shop, these two guys almost killed each other.
 Tell me about it. 
 Oh, my gosh, look at your mom's hair.
 Stefan still locked up?
 What? I just wonder if he's ever gonna feel bad for trying to make me destroy our whole town and kill God knows how many people.
 I know, Stefan's not himself. The sirens, the devil, the mind control. But it's still him that did all those things. It's hard to keep giving him a pass.
 I got a question for you.
 Hi, Dorian. I don't care about the weather. I need you to tell me what this is.
 A time capsule from the 18th century settlement that became Mystic Falls.
 Why would it have a Maxwell crest on it?
 Wouldn't be the weirdest thing I've heard in the last few days. Thanks.
 What's this about?
 Who told him that?
 I know you mean well. But if Mystic Falls goes up in flames, I'd rather go with it.
 Becoming a vampire isn't survival, Caroline. It's a death sentence all the same. 
 Any word from Damon?
 Real talk, since you're in the circle of trust and all, the devil's in town.
 And very unsafe.
 There's no alternative, Caroline. It's life or death, that's it.
 And pain. It's violence and murder. It's a choice you can never take back. It's a choice you'll regret forever.
 Stop!
 Everyone come with me. 
 Great. Now we can all pretend like this day never happened... except for the people who are dead.
 I'm just being honest. Okay? I'm hanging on by a thread. This whole town's hanging on by a thread. This isn't the town we grew up in anymore.
 That's not spiked with blood, is it?
 I'm sorry you got dragged into this.
 What's it say?
 You're going back to work? Do you ever sleep?
 I got a question for you. I need you to tell me what this is. It's a cipher device used for code-breaking.
 No. Something's wrong with me.
 I don't know, but I'm telling you, I could feel the heat from the flames... hear the screams of all those people burning.
 No, Ric, this was different. It was like I was actually there.
 How is that even possible?
 Okay, then who am I linked to?
 Bennett?
 I wonder if Bonnie would know something about this. 
 Everything okay?
 Bonnie's not picking up. I've tried her five times.
 You mean this?
 Why are you so interested in my family tree all of a sudden?
 The bell. Maxwell's journal. It's the old house where the witches were burned. But it's not old, it looks like it's brand-new. 
 It's Sybil. She's here. She wants Ethan to come with her. He can't resist her.
 We're in the caves. There's a door. It's the room where you found the journal. It's full of the sirens' treasures. There's tools and weapons.
 Seline's there, too. She has the tuning fork. They're forcing Ethan to add it to the bell. When my master, Cade, learned of your bell's ability to drive us from your lands, he devised an altogether different purpose for it.
 The witches are gathering for the ringing of the bell. ETHAN can't warn Bea, because he's been sirened not to tell her.
 He's encoded a message for her. He can't stop himself. He's been sirened to ring the bell and destroy the town.
 One. Oh! 
 Two. 
 They're trying to stop it. Twelve! 
 The witches are trying to hold back the flames and save the town. 
 Bea... Bea.
 Beatrice. Beatrice, she has a plan to stop the sirens.
 She's trapped him in the room where you found his bones.
 He's trying to tell her the only way he can. It's in the journal.
 Where is it? Where's Damon?
 Not long.
 Seriously. I've been hypnotized, almost died of a heart attack, and lost the only means of killing the devil, and then I came here to tell you how sorry I am about Enzo. The last part being the most important. I know sorry doesn't change anything or bring him back. Believe me, I know what it's like to be on the other end of one of these. There's nothing I can say or do.
 You're one of the strongest people I know. I think I know where you get some of that strength from. It's a long story. I'll tell you when you're up for it. Turns out, our families go way back. I never truly appreciated what badasses you Bennett witches were.
 Try and find comfort in the fact that Enzo loved you and he will always be with you. Call if you need me.
 Dad, get up! Come on, Dad! Do something, please!
 Nine. This thing’s heating up! Ten. Dad, come on! Eleven.
 So the victim was here until you closed? Did he say where he was going? If he was meeting up with anyone?
 Give me a minute.
 Dad, when’d you get back?
 Mom?
 After waiting four years since your last phone message?
 I thought you hated him for leaving us?
 I'm not sure I'll be free.
 In this case all of us in Mystic Falls.
 Even if Katherine rings the bell, she can't create hellfire. Only someone from the Maxwell bloodline can do that. Dad's not gonna do it and neither am I.
 Where is she?
 You threw her out the window?
 Damon!
 Vicki.
 Damon!
 And where are you going?
 I can't believe you're here.
 Vick, this is our home.
 You're gonna believe Katherine Pierce? She's a liar!
 Yeah, it's Sheriff Donovan. Activate the evacuation protocol. Gas leak. Yeah, again.
 Dad!
 I need you to get in a van so they can transport you to Grove Hill.
 It's Vicki, Dad.
 All right guys, keep on moving. Everybody out.
