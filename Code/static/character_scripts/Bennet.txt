 Didn't I tell you not to rush your elders? We move a little slower.
 Do you think I was born yesterday? I know what you're doing. You can't survive all these people coming through you... and even if you could, when it's all said and done, you're still the anchor, and when this places goes...
 No you don't. I was going to say that it's been my privledge to watch you grow into the beautiful woman you've become.
 No. I'm staying here.
 I can't come, Bonnie. You're not the only member of this family that knows how to make a sacrifice.
 It means that I'm going to be fine. I found peace because I made sure that you'll find yours.
 Not your concern. Just know that I looked out for you.
 I love you Bonnie. You stay strong.
