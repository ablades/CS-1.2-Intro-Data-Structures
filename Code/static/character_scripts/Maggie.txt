 Gold star for impulse control. Don't worry. I'm not here to judge.
 Maggie James, and you're Stefan Salvatore. Another vampire. Sorry. It's just  it's all so fascinating. Here. I've been staring at Damon's picture for years. Guess you got the handsome genes.
 I spent the last two years searching for your brother. I know everything about the two of you.
 He knew a friend of mine who died in a fire. I was hoping you'd know where to find him.
 Well, it's a good thing I don't want to talk to him. I wanna kill him.
 You just said he's he a lost cause. I'd be doing the world a favor.
 It's the only way to get you out of here. Make me a vampire. I'll save you. We'll run away together. Don't you want to be with me?
 Then I'm ready. Dr. Whitmore's back. You need to hurry.
 Sorry.
 I'd like to interview you for an article I'm writing.
 Not quite. I'm with the Whitmore College Alumni Gazette. Where is my cigarette lighter?
 Oh. Then you remember the fire of '58 at Whitmore House?
 I'm afraid that's a little glib to quote for the Gazette, seeing as over a dozen people died.
 You really are a monster.
