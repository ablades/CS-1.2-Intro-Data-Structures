 You told me to stay under the radar.
 Are you sure these vamps killed Mason?
 I'm not afraid of a vampire.
 I say let's get both.
 I see you got the bullet out. That was nasty. I got lots of wooden bullets, other toys. It's gonna be a long night, sweet pea.
 So, How many vampires are there in this town anyway?
 No?
 You're a vampire. Why not?
 I'm sorry, what was that?
 Excuse me? What was that?
 No, I'm just getting started.
 You want to talk duty and honor? These are vampires. They cross one of us, they cross all of us. That's who we are.
 Which one of you killed Mason?
 Boys, make sure that one suffers.
 No, man. You're living in vampire country, that's all. It's way better than this.
 I don't get what Mason was even doing here in the first place.
 Why was he stupid enough to stay and get himself killed?
 
 A moonstone? Did he find it?
 Where is it now?
 
 We can't let them do that, even if we have to kill every last vampire in this town.
 We need you to help us find the moonstone.
 But if we break it, they're stuck as night-walkers, and we can turn whenever we want.
 There's more. Stevie?
 Nice. Let's go get our doppelg√§nger.
 We're good to go.
 You up for this?
 These people have done nothing but lie to you. This girl that you've known since birth, she's with the vampires now, the ones who killed Mason. They're the enemy, and if they break that curse, well...all of us are as good as dead. Are you up for this?
 Good. Because if you wuss out, you're gonna have me to deal with, you got it?
 Keep him down. If he moves 
 I can smell you.
