 Today we're going to talk about shadow reckoning. This is a method of measuring heights by the sun's shadow. Let's say, for example, that we're going to measure the distance of a shadow. We're gonna take this measure here, measure the length, and we're going to multiply that by the height of the source. Building height can also be measured, using a clinometer, which we're going to make in class tomorrow.
 So I tell my students, chemistry is about attraction and reaction. Sometimes it's beautiful, just as often, it's destructive...
 As you can imagine, it's the more destructive reactions that your students are the most interested in...
