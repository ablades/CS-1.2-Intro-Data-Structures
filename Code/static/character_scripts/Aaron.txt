 Hey.
 We knew each other growing up.
 Pretty sad memorial, huh? Guess it's not exactly cool to mourn during fall rush.
 Yeah. Well, what Megan would have wanted was to still be here alive.
 Yeah. I know. That's what they said.
 Yeah. If you care about her, get her sunflowers. She liked those.
 Yeah. I do.
 Hey, whatever you're supposed to be.
 Impressed.
 Why do you want to know who I am?
 Of course not.
 Because everyone around me dies. It's like a curse. My friends, my family  one by one, I've lost every single person in my life. So, if you had any idea what survivor's guilt felt like, you'd leave me alone.
 It's Aaron. My name. I'll see you around, maybe.
 What?
 I'm fine.
 You know, you sound like that dad who thinks he's cool, but isn't.
 Can I have some money for a cab? I mean, do you manage my trust, right?
 
 Whatever. 
 No. Just uh...trying to figure out why Wes told me to stay away from you.
 Aaron. We met yesterday. You changed your hair...it's...
 The what?
 I still have no idea.
 
 Hi.
 See you then.
 Jesse! 
 Okay. So this isn't the lamest party that I've ever been to.
 Barely. I think I fell asleep. I just woke up.
 Oh. Now I know why Wes told me to stay away from you. Cheers.
 Mmm. You're trouble.
 He's my legal guardian.
 Mm-hmm.
 Uh, dead.
 Whoa. Dark. No offense, but usually, I'm the biggest freak in the room.
 So how'd it happen?
 Hmm.
 I was six, and we went camping, and I woke up to the sound of my mom screaming. I went to check it out, and I saw blood everywhere. They had bite marks all over their neck.
 Yeah. They said a bear got into the camp. So I shuffled around distant relatives for a while. Eventually, Wes took me in. So Wes is the closest thing to family I have left.
 Yeah. Me, too.
 That Jesse's dead. He killed himself last night. Campus security came by to tell me.
 What's up with this college? It's supposed to be different. I came here to start fresh, get away from all the crap in my past.
 How do you hit the reset button?
 So, if you're not here about Jesse, uh, why are you here?
 My day's not gonna get any worse, so, uh, go ahead.
 Yeah. Since past summer after my aunt Sara died. You see what I'm talking about? Everyone around me ends up dead, and my sunny disposition makes me so many friends. It's  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Just doesn't make sense why Jesse would kill himself.
 Why, do you know something else?
 Yeah, of course I think it's weird. Jesse loved it here, he had a huge crush on your friend. Megan had all these plans for her life.
 You saw her death certificate?
 
 Oh, yeah. This place is like a second home.
 What are you waiting for? Come in.
 Not to sound like a douche, but technically, I do. 
 That's what they think.
 What the hell?
 You know that this is kidnapping, right?
 
 
 What?
 Where did all this stuff come from?
 Why didn't you ever tell me about this?
 Anna Ruby Campground. That's where my parents died.
 It wasn't an animal attack, was it?
 What the hell is this place?
 
 I wanna know the truth. When you met at Megan's memorial, you asked me a bunch of questions.
 Yeah? Well, I've never used a gun before,...
 Wes said a vampire killed Megan. 
 Wes also said a vampire killed my parents. Maybe that was you, too.
 Why else would you be so interested in me?
 Why else would you pretend to be my friend? 
 What did you just say? 
 
 What I found out was that I've been lied to my entire life. What the hell is going on, Wes? 
 I have no idea where Wes took her.
 
 How are you not dead? I shot you.
 I have no idea. All that Wes told me was to go about my life as usual.
 Do you have Elena?
 Uh, Stefan and Damon Salvatore are gonna kill me unless you give them Elena.
 Or he's in front of me imagining what my kidney would taste like.
 Why don't you finish the rest of the story, Damon?
 It's right here.
 Uh, does somebody want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
 
 
 Yeah. Well, you know, he's not gonna help me, why should I help him?
 All the files of my family history are in here.
 
 Damon left out the best part of the Augustine story, the part after he escaped.
 It wasn't enough for Damon to kill the doctors who tortured him. He had to torture their families and their future families. He spent the last sixty years killing every one of my relatives except he's a psychopath. He leaves one alive so that they can continue the family line so that he can destroy future generations of innocent people. So go ahead and do it, kill me because I don't want to give Damon the satisfaction, so do it. 
 Stefan?
 This is everything Wes gave me on Augustine. I saw Elena's last name on a few pages. Maybe it will help.
 Wes? Wes?
 
 Do you really think that you're helping people with this vampire crap? You sold me out! You used my life as a bargaining chip.
 I never want to see you again. Get the hell out of my life.
 Hey! You clean the fireplace?
 I'm here for Elena but, eh... clearly she's not here. So, eh, I'll come back later.
 Uhh.. yeah, can you just tell her that Wes isn't going to be a problem anymore? I mean, my family's trust just came through and I was able to cut off Augustine's funding
 Yeah. It's over. And uh.. just tell her I'm sorry... I'm really sorry.
 Okay.
 Enzo....
 I didn't see that one coming.
 Because Elena would hate you for it.... why you can't kill me.
 You alright, man?
 You said that you were gonna let me go.
 Does Elena know that you're here?
 What do you want, Damon?
 Everyone I've lost was because of you. Who murdered my entire family? YOU.
 Elena was too good for you.
 So. What'd you do? Did you kill them?
 Hey there!
 Are you okay?
 That would explain a lot actually.
 Because I'm not actually here.
 Elena?
 You don't look so hot..
