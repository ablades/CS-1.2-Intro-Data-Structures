 Is there coffee?
 Don't start.
 Don't take more than two in a six-hour window.
 Pete Wentz, huh? How old school T.R.L. of you. Carson Daly fan?
 No, I'm not.
 Stop, all right?! You need to chill yourself, all right?
 Look, stop! I don't have anything on me. Are you crazy?
 I don't need this.
 Hey Vick.
 Hey, what's your deal? I mean, summer you act one way and then school starts and you can't be bothered.
 When's the last time you had sex with a puppy?
 Yeah, and deflowered and deflowered.
 Oh,come on, the guy's a total douche. He only wants you for your ass.
 Hey, leave her alone!
 It seems like you did.
 I'm drunk. Am I throwing myself at you?
 Is that what you think?
 I don't want to hear it!
 Vicki? No! Oh, my god, it's Vicki!
 No!
 I've seen you in the cemetery writing in your diary. Is that is that supposed to be you moving on?
 I just...how is she?
 Yeah, but she's gonna be OK, right?
 Hey, Tyler. Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt. I was just wondering how Vicki's doing, since you guys are so close. Is she ok?
 How bad is she? Do they know what attacked her? Is she going to make a full recovery? Was she happy to see you? What room number was she in?
 Yeah, you keep saying that, but when are you actually going to do it? Huh? 'Cause I vote for right here and right now.
 No, this is your final warning, dick. I'm sick of watching you play Vicki. If you hurt her one more time, I swear to God, I will kill you.
 No, I'm good, thanks.
 You get high?
 Hey. How do you feel?
 I just wanted to see how you were doing.
 Well, you gotta get over that.
 You have to get over that, too. Do you see Mr. Concerned? Tyler? Are you under there? No.
 No one's going to suspect anything. Why wouldn't I check on you? I mean, I'm the one who found you.
 Yeah, I carried you out of the woods.
 Yeah, you're welcome.
 More stoner stories? Look, Jenna, I get it, you were cool. And so that's...that's cool.
 Ow! Why? Why...why did you do that?
 Parental authority, I like it. Sleep tight.
 Vicki, what are you doing here?
 Are you feeling ok?
 Well, the doctor gave you something, right?
 Here. Knock yourself out, literally.
 So you gonna, uh, watch the comet later?
 Hey, has anyone seen Vicki?
 I can't find her.
 You wanna do this right now?
 She already did. Over and over and over again.
 And I didn't even have to force her into it.
 I'll come with you.
 I'm not dealing.
 You and Jenna, between the two of you. Enough already!
 I vote for none of the above.
 You and Tyler have fun.
 You're not worried everyone's going to know you're screwing the stoner geek? Oh, wait...everyone already knows.
 Tell me something, was it the drugs? Were you sleeping with me because of the drugs?
 No, if there's another reason, please, I'm all ears.
 I find it pretty easy.
 All right, I get it. Hit me to impress her. That's...That's real nice.
 Am I? 'Cause it seems like I'm standing here waiting for you to man up.
 No, next time I see you.
 I'm fine!
 Just stop, ok?
 How much do you think this stuff is worth? You know, like on eBay?
 That stuff is mom and dad's. You can't just give it away.
 You realize you had to ask him to ask you, right? You figure if you dress up like a respectable young lady, he'll finally treat you like one?
 You know you're making the wrong choice, yet you make it anyway. It's sad.
 Yeah, be careful with it, dick.
 I got your punk.
 Not even if you meant it.
 Ahh! God, what now?
 What watch?
 Maybe she did. Maybe Tyler took it.
 Screw you. I would never sell this, ok?
 Because it's supposed to be mine. Dad said it goes to the firstborn son. His father gave it to him, and now what?
 Yeah.
 Just take it and get out.
 You look amazing. What are you doing here?
 What did you do?
 I'm a drug-using delinquent. A girl in bed doesn't really rank. Sorry.
 You ok?
 Don't answer a question with another question. Maybe. What's wrong with you?
 Well, you should go get something to eat.
 Well, I was feeling romantic.
 Those are left over from the car accident.
 No not with that, that's an antique. I feel like we're always getting high.
 Well, then let's choose not to. I mean, we don't have to be high all the time, right?
 No.
 Where are you taking me?
 What, a cemetery?
 I'm stoned in a cemetery.
 You took those from the house?
 She's gonna notice if they're gone. That's not cool.
 Yeah, it kinda is, Vick.
 Well, what are we doing, partying in a cemetery with a bunch of losers?
 They're waste of space small-town lifers.
 You're different, Vick.
 Look 
 What are you doing here?
 I'm Coming!
 Where have you been?
 Did something happen?
 You're high? Vicki, it's the middle of the day.
 Come this way.
 I...I don't know.
 Turn what off?
 That's where we were last night.
 What happened after I left last night, Vick?
 I'm fine. I'm fine.
 Aw, you just...you need to sleep it off, ok?
 She was fine, and then she just...she just freaked out.
 Maybe we should check in with Matt.
 Well, what are we supposed to do?
 I don't know what's wrong with her.
 Oh, no, it's cool, I'm done.
 Police station. They're organizing the search party for Vicki, so...
 What? You're kidding me, right?
 Yeah, your lips keep movin'. I don't know why.
 You gotta call me, Vic. I don't get it. What's going on with you? Just...just call me please.
 Cool. Sure. Sounds uh...sounds fun. Can't wait.
 What does that even mean, "let her go"? Oh, okay, sure. Since we're such experts on letting people go, right?
 Look, for months after mom and dad died, I felt like crap, like "nothing really even mattered" crap. Now all of a sudden, I get these moments and things started to feel just a little bit better, and Vicki was in every single of 'em. So you may not see it, but trust me. Keeping me away from her is not for the best.
 Whoa. Vic, you scared the hell out of me.
 I was so worried about you.
 Wh...what? Where?
 No, you can't. You can't just leave.
 Okay. Yeah. Ow. You're taking that costume a little too far. What? What is it? Vicki! Vicki, what the hell?! Oh, my god. No! stop! Vicki! No! Ah!
 Vicki!
 Vicki! Vicki! Vicki! Vicki!
 No. I don't understand. I mean, I know what I saw, but...I don't understand.
 Now she's dead. Vicki's dead.
 Make it stop. It hurts.
 Why does everybody have to die on me?
 She didn't.
 None that I remember.
 I'll miss her but....I think it's for the best.
 Wanna keep it down over there?
 Homework.
 I gotta finish this. I'm way behind and I have a quiz tomorrow so...
 He can hear you.
 Hey Mr. Saltzman, I'm Jeremy Gilbert. You wanted to see me?
 I know it's been a rough couple of months, but I've been trying to turn them around.
 
 Okay. About what?
 
 I thought you were still in that whole Logan-depression thing.
 Well, I can introduce you.
 No, not yet. It's gotta be local and non-internet research, so...
 What stuff?
 Mr. Saltzman.
 This is my aunt, Jenna.
 What the hell?
 I found this, too.
 Cruel is dating my history teacher.
 "I live in fear. It consumes me. In the early evening when I see the sun begin to fade, the fear comes, because I know that the night brings death."
 Hey, what do you think?
 I found this old journal in dad’s stuff, Johnathan Gilbert from the 1800s. He's kind of a freak show. 
 Oh, he wrote fiction? Figured he was just a lunatic or a drunk.
 Hey. Uh, I’m just surprised to see you here. 
 I didn’t know you drew.
 Because it’s good stuff. You like graphics? Cause that's, uh, that's kind of my thing.
 
 You want us to what?
 I don’t think so, sir.
 That's not gonna happen.
 Hey.
 I don’t know. I, uh, I thought that was weird with your dad, what he did. Is he like that all the time? Is that...Is that what you gotta go through? Man, I...I get it. I get it. 
 Seriously, you don’t have to be like this. You don't.
 What is your problem, man?
 Hey, Mr. Saltzman!
 Mystic Falls, the Civil War era.
 My family. I found a journal of an ancestor who lived in the 1800s. And the Gilberts were one of the original Founding Families of Mystic Falls. So...
 Yeah, I'm fine.
 
 Local. 1860s. Do you work here?
 The town's fear and hysteria surrounding the war and how it influenced certain writers of the time.
 The origin of local folklore and myths.
 You're kidding me, right? There's no such thing as vampires.
 Yeah, that would be folklore. Vampires are a metaphor for the demons of the day!
 The union soldiers! I've read the stories myself. They talk about the enemy, the demons that attack at night.
 Allegorical vampires. Which is what it is. Creative expression during a very volatile time. I mean, a country at war doesn't want realism. They want fantasy. Thus, vampire fiction.
 Yeah. I've had a rough go of it lately, but I'm just now getting back to my old self.
 Wait. A journal?
 Are you sure you have to go?
 So, you have no idea where the journal is?
 I just find it weird that our ancestors kept the same kind of journal. It's crazy.
 No. It's gotta be metaphorical. My ancestor wrote short stories.
 No, I'm hung up on the fiction of it all because I've seen "The Lost Boys" and "Near Dark," like, fifty times.
 Uh, yeah, sure.
 No, it's I don't want you to get the wrong idea. I just recently got out of something. It's a little too soon, you know?
 Hey.
 What is it?
 What does this mean?
 
 No. I mean, I think statistically there's been more animal attacks, mysterious deaths, uh, people gone missing, more than any other place in the whole commonwealth of Virginia.
 Ah, I won't.
 Oh, my ancestor's journal?
 Really?
 You think my essay's creative, wait till you get a load of this thing.
 What?
 Oh. I got an "A." Thanks for the articles. They really helped.
 I don't even believe it. It's just a paper, Anna. Anyways, I, uh—I gotta get goin'.
 Uh, sorry. I'm stuck on punch duty at the school dance.
 Well, I'm failin' English, so I copped a plea.
 Well, thanks for the help. I'll—I'll see you around.
 What are you doing here?
 You're doin' that thing again.
 That thing where you pretend we're dating, even though we're not.
 You don't go to school here. You know, you don't have to help.
 Why?
 Uh, I don't have it.
 No. I mean, I gave it to my history teacher.
 Because he wanted to read it.
 But I should give it to you?
 Well, I loaned it to Mr. Saltzman.
 What's the big deal with this stupid journal?
 
 What are you guys doing?
 Johnathan Gilbert's journal?
 I just did a history report on it.
 I gave it to Mr. Saltzman. He wanted to see it.
 You said you never played this thing before.
 This girl Anna. She can be, uh, persistent.
 Yeah, yeah, but she can be weird.
 Dude!
 Huh?
 
 Why is everybody so obsessed with that thing?
 Just that girl Anna.
 Yeah.
 I just know her. She wants me to meet her at the Grill tonight.
 O-Okay.
 Well, I kinda miss my daily dose of cute stalker chick.
 Let's play.
 Oh, hey, Stefan. 
 Anna.
 Don't have one, Lockwood.
 Uh, she went somewhere with Stefan.
 Who is Duke?
 Wait, Duke goes to Duke?
 Uh, yeah, I - I don't think so.
 Anna! Hey-uh, what happened to you last night?
 I haven't seen her.
 Hey, do you wanna go to a party tonight?
 Oh, the guy who's throwing it is a total douche, but it's supposed to be fun. I figured, you know, safety in numbers.
 It's been a while since I've been to a party, and I kind of want to get back out there. And not be such a - a loner. And, uh, I like you. You're fun, and you're also kind of strange and lurky but, uh, I guess I like that, too. So, yeah, you should come to the party. With me. It's in the woods by that old cemetery.
 Oh. Okay! Great.
 Cool.
 Wait, you're kidding me, right? You act like a total dick every time we cross paths, and - and now you wanna party with me?
 Look, I don't get you man.
 I don't party anymore and even if I did, it wouldn't be with you.
 Thank God.
 Uh, nothing. Nothing, just....
 It's- nothing.
 You kinda like dead people, huh?
 Uh, yeah. Yeah. This place makes me think about someone.
 No, no, just...someone I used to know. So, uh, hey, 
 I'm not really sure what my scene is anymore. So what do you say? You, uh, you wanna be part of my non-scene?
 Wait, what?
 Oh. Uh- that's that's a bummer.
 Well, yeah.
 I guess it is.
 Anna, your face!
 It didn't look like nothing.
 Uh- it's alright. I just....I wish I knew how I passed out. I didn't drink that much, I swear.
 The whole things pretty cloudy. I just...I know how this looks. I'm   I'm sorry.
 Yeah, okay.
 No, I'm just...I'm gonna crash.
 Anna?
 I thought you and your mom were leaving town.
 No, no, no. I mean...I am. Of course I am.
 What made you and your mom decide to stay in town?
 Yeah?
 Well, I wish you were there now. I actually have to write another paper. I was thinking about squeezing one more out on "the vampire in Mystic Falls".
 No, I want to go deeper, you know. I want to understand why people were labelled as vampires back in the day. I mean, maybe there's such a thing has vampires, they're just different from the way we always thought they were.
 Well, maybe they're normal and good, just outsiders you know? Um, misunderstood.
 Don't you think it could be possible? You did give me all that info.
 Alright. Roast beef, turkey, what do you want?
 Ok, I like your style. Will you grab the bread for me?
 It's just a cut. Can you hand me that towel?
 You got a problem with blood Anna?
 What's the matter? It's just blood, Anna.
 I knew it. Go for it.
 Jenna! Hey, what's up?
 Ah...Same old. Same old...You?
 What the hell?
 Yeah, but you didn't.
 But you didn't.
 I knew this girl. Vicki. She was attacked by an animal, a bite to the neck. She started acting crazy, weird, and it seemed like drugs, but then you showed me those articles. And then I saw your face and how it changed the night in the cemetery when I kissed you.
 Who would believe me?
 Why didn't you kill me?
 Like what?
 Because if it was true, maybe it's true about Vicki. And also because...I want you to turn me.
 Is that a vampire thing? Cause I read vampires don't like running water.
 Seriously?
 You gotta tell me more. I gotta know.
 Come on, you can't keep saying "no" to me.
 That's not true, and you know it.
 Cause I...
 Hey, what's up?
 Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
 Wait. Does your mom know you're a...
 "Not ready" Is a step up from "No."
 Thanks. My sister got it for me.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 No. No. But I don't see why it would be a problem. It's not like she knows what you are.
 You know, why don't you...why don't you keep this?
 Because. You like it. And I like you.
 No. I...I like you.
 So, I have an answer.
 Why you should turn me.
 Look, I wake up every day, and I feel okay, but there's something missing. Like a...like a hole. Some people, they fit...in life, or whatever. I...I don't.
 You should turn me because I don't have anything else.
 Wait. She's dead?
 I'm gonna go get some sleep.
 My...my friend Vicki...She's—She's dead.
 Yep. Turns out she's been dead all along.
 Look, I'm sorry.
 Uncle John, what's up?
 Nah.
 I just don't want any.
 That's what I don't get, she was doing okay.
 How did she end up buried in the woods? That's what I don't understand.
 Yeah but you leave her, you don't take the time to bury her.
 I've no interest in the Founders' Day Kick-off Party.
 What's up?
 Uh, yeah, sure.
 I just can't believe mom and dad never told you that you were adopted.
 Why were you worried about what I thought?
 Does it bug you that we're not?
 Yeah, yeah he's really been helping me out. He gave me some extra credit and stuff.
 He thought I had a clever angle.
 I don't know, boredom or maybe I'm just as nuts as the long line of Gilbert crazies.
 Easy for you to say, you're not one.
 Excuse me Sheriff. I was curious if there's been any more information about what happened to Vicki Donovan?
 Yeah, but her body was buried. Somebody must have done that.
 It's okay.
 No one is trying to figure out what happened to her. They all want to believe that she OD'd.
 Is that what you believe?
 I think somebody killed her and buried her body and I don't think we should write it off just ‘cause it's easy.
 The truth is the only thing that's gonna help people to move on.
 Whatever it was? So you don't think it was an overdose?
 Is there something you're not telling me?
 Why aren't you looking at me?
 If there was something else you would tell me, right?
 Fine.
 I'm fine Elena.
 Are there really a whole month of these events that I'm supposed to show up at?
 Yeah, you mentioned you know a lot about the family. You know anything about our ancestor Jonathan Gilbert?
 Well, I read his journal.
 Yeah, I actually found it in all dads' stuff.
 There are more of them?
 And did you read them?
 What did you think about what he wrote?
 Yeah—uh—she's a friend of mine. Excuse me.
 Anna!
 Come on, don't be like that.
 No, I wasn't using you.
 Look, I don't think it's any worse than you becoming friends with me so you could give your mother my blood.
 It's not important.
 Everything. I know everything.
 I don't care.
 She keeps things from me, I'm gonna keep things from her.
 I don't know. There's a part of me that's so angry, you know, that she covered up what happened to Vicki and erased my memory but there's also this other part of me that's glad. I...I don't want to remember Vicki like that.
 No, as someone who wanted to hurt me.
 Yeah I know that.
 Just a sec.
 What are you doing here?
 A class schedule?
 You're kidding me, right?
 Heh. But why would you want to go to high school? It blows.
 You'd suffer through all this just to hang out with me?
 That's, um...
 It's awesome. It's awesome.
 So, your mother was in love with Johnathan Gilbert, and he betrayed her?
 And now my uncle John wants this invention-device thing that she gave to Damon.
 John mentioned there were more Gilbert journals. I bet that's how he knows everything.
 I'm not gonna say anything.
 Oh, you don't know that.
 Well, I'm not.
 Oh, yeah? What would that be?
 I don't want Jenna to walk in on us.
 Wait. You can hear that? That is so cool.
 Hey.
 Nice try, though.
 That's okay. You only woke me halfway.
 That feels good.
 Hey Anna. Where are you? What's up? Uh...Give me a call when you get this.
 I don't know. She won't return my calls.
 No, no trouble. Anna just owes me a call, that's it.
 Why?
 I know Anna extremely well.
 Why?
 I'm ah...I'm good.
 Elena!
 No, not lately. Listen, do you have a second?
 Well, it's Anna. I've left her all this messages and she hasn't gotten back to me, not even a text.
 We're more than friends. Look, something could be seriously wrong and if you know anything you've got to tell me.
 Are you lying to me right now?
 ‘Cause that's what you do. Lying. You lie about everything. I know what Anna is and I know that you know. So tell me, do you have any idea where she is?
 Here you go .(He gives him the towel.)
 What is she after?
 Why?
 But why would a vampire help you kill other vampires?
 All of them? No, there are some good ones out there.
 I don't believe that.
 How did my father know about all this?
 Hello?
 Yeah yeah I'm fine, Uncle John hit his head. It was an accident.
 But yeah I'm okay.
 Yeah.
 No, we really don't.
 Yeah? Because I'm pretty sure that your journal covered it.
 And save me the speech about invasion of privacy because I read a section about Damon erasing my memory, about what happened to Vicki.
 Get out!
 Elena! Just get out. Please.
 Anna? What are you doing here?
 What?
 Oh, my god, Anna. Hey, I'm so sorry.
 It's okay.
 Anna.
 I know, it's stupid, huh? I'm part of the parade; but how are you? I've been so worried and I feel awful.
 Are you sure it was him?
 No, no way. It's just...I do understand where he's coming from. He's convinced all the tomb vampires want revenge on this town and he's just...he's trying to protect it.
 You're leaving?
 Anna...
 I wanted to, I did.
 But I don't think I can. Sorry.
 Go away, Elena.
 Why don't you have Damon erase my memory again? Then I could go back to being your in-the-dark little brother.
 Just don't! You can't fix this that easily; something like this doesn't just get fixed.
 You go to hell, Elena.
 You're a dick!
 So, you're going to kill me just ‘cause I hurt Elena's feelings?
 She erased my memories.
 It wasn't her call to make.
 Let go of me before I cause a scene.
 Yeah.
 You shouldn't have made me forget...
 Anna what are you doing here? My uncle could see you.
 Anna what's wrong? Anna!
 Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Hey, leave her alone!
 Leave her alone! Anna!!!
 What are you doing here?
 I figured that once they took her away.
 Yeah, I did.
 Why are you telling me all this?
 Look, I know you think you took it away, but it's still there. Even if I can't remember why. I still feel empty, and alone, and making me forget won't fix it. It won't fix what's really wrong.
 Anna said that vampires don't have to feel pain; that they could turn it off, if they shut out their humanity.
 Is it easier that way?
 Life.
 Is that what you did?
 I'm fine, okay? I feel exactly the same.
 You mean I'm not a vampire? Damn it!
 Did you hear about Anna, what happened to her tonight? She's dead.
 Yeah, I understand.
 No, I don't need a babysitter.
 Why don't they save it for the funeral?
 In and out? It sounds like a plan.
 Sorry, I was just looking for the...
 Hey look...I'm sorry about your dad.
 I remember when my dad died; I had a house full of strangers telling me what a great guy he was. Anyway, I know how hard all this is.
 Yeah, yeah he was.
 Yeah, you know what, sure. Why not?
 What are you doing here?
 So, you figured you'd kill all your evil vampires and then you leave town?
 Why don't you tell her yourself?
 My father would have seen things differently.
 That ring on your finger, the one's that supposed to protect you, that was my father's right?
 Then why didn't it protect him, why is he still dead?
 I wonder what he'd think of all this, of me.
 I don't believe in that family legacy stuff.
 Elena, what's going on in here?
 He killed me! Damon killed me!
 It protects me from compulsion.
 Like poison?
 But why vervain?
 Like a stake to the heart?
 You're pretty confident in yourself telling me all the different ways I could kill you.
 Yeah, Damon is the one that deserves it.
 I was killed by a vampire and brought back by a magic ring. How do you move forward from that?
 Yeah, yeah, I set up the gold fish toss all three hundred gold fish. It's gonna be epic! (He leaves.)
 Aren't you a little old for a high school carnival?
 You're pretty funny cracking jokes when I could I don't know...blow the whole lid off this thing by telling someone what you really are.
 Maybe it is.
 You don't lock your front door.
 No I wouldn't...I laced it with vervain.
 So I could stake you...with this.
 It's only fair. You killed me first.
 My father hated vampires, my uncle too. They were absolute. They knew exactly what they stood for and I figure maybe I should too. I mean, stand for something. But killing you, what's that gonna do?
 Dick.
 He did?
 Yeah I tried. It's a lot harder than it looks.
 I can't believe Tyler Lockwood is a werewolf.
 It should be enough easy for us to figure it out.
 By definition of being in this family, I'm involved.
 Alright. Just saying.
 Hey man, how have you been?
 I don't know, I haven't seen you much since your father's funeral. I just figured maybe you'd want...
 Yeah, okay.
 Yeah, I know the feeling well. What are you doing here?
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
 No, no. No way.
 Okay, yeah. Check it out.
 Just some sketches. You still draw, Tyler?
 Yeah. Okay, sure.
 Oh man, I've seen you said before, it's great.
 Aah, I...don't really see it there.
 I can't...I can't breathe!
 Because...because I know.
 I know what you are.
 My uncle John left this old diary lying around. It was written by a crazy Gilbert ancestor who wrote about this curse that ran in your family.
 Werewolves. It's crazy, right? But then, Matt was attacked by a wolf under a full moon and your uncle had just gotten back to town. It was too weird. Is it true?
 But you...you're not?
 I don't think so but then again, I always did believe in the crazy stuff.
 Is that why he came back? To tell you all this?
 What is it?
 Why didn't you give it to him?
 I'm good, thanks.
 Sarah!
 Look, he didn't mean it okay? You got her?
 I need to talk to you.
 Tyler Lockwood has to kill someone to activate his curse. He's not a werewolf yet.
 But Mason Lockwood is and he's looking for a moonstone, a special rock connected to the werewolf legend. That's why he's here.
 And I know where it is.
 Do I need a reason? Look, I just want to help, okay?
 Well, Elena doesn't want me getting involved in all this.
 You going to let me in or not?
 Helping Damon. I'm the one who found out about the moonstone.
 Not exactly.
 An Aztec curse? Cool.
 What do you mean sealed?
 Tyler.
 Yeah.
 So, you do believe it?
 He's not making me do anything, Damon and I...
 I don't really care what you want, Elena. It's because of you that I'm in this mess in the first place, so I'm sorry, but you really don't get to tell me what I'm gonna do.
 Hey man.
 Hey, so I did a little research on that stone you showed me.
 I don't know. Curiosity, boredom.
 Well, it turns out that it's part of this Aztec legend but I want to make sure it's the same kind of stone. You think I could check it out again?
 Why did you do that?
 Yeah, yeah sure. It's probably...Just, uh, stupid folklore anyways. Forget it.
 I found something in Ric's box of stuff.
 I did a search on my phone. It's a plant. Aconitum Vulparia. It grows in the mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere. Commonly known as aconite, blue rocket, and wolfsbane.
 Well, every source says something different. One myth says it causes lycanthropy, which sounds bogus. Another one says that it protects people and another one says, well, it's toxic.
 If he was gonna say anything, he would have already!
 I'm staying.
 I'm staying, Damon. He's had enough.
 Damon...
 Is she okay?
 Does she remember what happened?
 Why would Katherine hurt Jenna?
 Hey, hey, hey, come here.
 It's gonna be okay.
 She's gonna pay, Elena. I don't know how but she's gonna pay.
 Yeah, you don't want to rip your stitches, hemorrhage and die, alright?
 It happens.
 Careful.
 So what are we gonna do?
 No, about Katherine.
 She tried to kill Jenna. We can't let her get away with that.
 And what if she tries something else?
 You are being naïve and you know it.
 Out. I'll be back.
 We're gonna kill Katherine.
 As long as Tyler doesn't kill anyone, he won't turn.
 I thought this room could work.
 Is that the spell book I read about in my family's old journal?
 Can you do all the stuff that's in there?
 Yeah but you're 100% witch, that is so cool.
 If you feel that way, why help?
 What's the matter? Are you cold?
 Are you okay?
 So can you do like a hocus pocus to ace a test?
 It'd be like the first one I'd learn or maybe like a sex spell or something. I don't know. Do you want to dance or something while we're waiting?
 Elena.
 Hey sorry, could I talk to my sister?
 I have a message from Stefan.
 He and Damon want you to meet them at the edge of the lake by the woods. They brought the moonstone.
 Because they know I'm not afraid of you.
 We saw an opportunity and we knew we had to take it.
 It's not just you anymore, Elena. She's messed with all of us, she has to be stopped.
 What's going on?
 Stop! You're hurting Elena! Everything you're doing to her is hurting Elena!
 Are you okay?
 They're stuck in there with her.
 You were right; Katherine had a witch link Elena to her.
 Where are you going?
 Take it.
 Elena listen to me  you need this more than I do.
 Hey, I was gonna head home, can I offer you a ride? Are you okay?
 I'm not a kid anymore, Bonnie.
 Yo, Elena!
 Look, Elena's got to let me know if I'm supposed to cover for her. Jenna's cool with the two of you but you guys are pushing it.
 You and Elena. Look, I'm glad you guys are back together but if she's gonna sleep over...
 Wait...she didn't stay at your place last night?
 ‘Cause her bed hadn't been slept in and Mrs. Lockwood said that her car was still in the driveway. Where is she then?
 How does this is work?
 That's 300 miles away.
 We can map it, aerial view will show us what's around there, help us narrow down the area.
 No, no, I'm coming with you!
 No, I'm gonna just sit here. What if she's hurt okay?
 Or worse? What if she's...?
 Well, you can't do this alone.
 He's getting her out of the house for a while so she doesn't ask questions about Elena. Look. I pulled this up based on that spot on the map.
 there's nothing for miles except for this old house.
 Yeah. I hate sitting here, waiting like this.
 You don't know that.
 What are you doing?
 I don't get it.
 Okay, yeah.
 What's all this stuff for?
 Bonnie? Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie!
 Bonnie.
 Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie!
 Here, drink this.
 What happened? You scared the hell out of me.
 It wasn't nothing, Bonnie.
 When I'm worn down, I take a nap. You were...you were unconscious.
 How do you know all this?
 Why not?
 By certain people, you mean Damon.
 I won't tell anyone, okay? I promise.
 It's how I feel a lot of the time, alone.
 Do you think that worked?
 Elena?
 Are you okay?
 Here, I got it.
 She's actually running late today. What are you doing later? You want to hang out at the grill, shoot some pool? The winner owns the table.
 Why what?
 Uh, I don't know, I thought it'd be fun, never mind.
 Just what?
 Yeah, yeah. I thought you might be.
 Yeah, yeah. Through the double doors then straight ahead, quick left and then your first right. You must be new here.
 I'm Jeremy, this is Bonnie.
 Anyway, Luka. I'm actually heading in that direction. Why you don't follow me? It can get confusing.
 Sorry I was late, are you okay?
 You are bad.
 Well, feel free to cheat if you need your dignity back.
 Get ready, this slaughter is almost over.
 What's with that weather, huh?
 The guy is weird, huh?
 What is it?
 How? It took both you and your Grams last time, and look what happened to her.
 Bonnie...
 Let me do it. I've got my ring. I can get in, get out, no spells necessary.
 What are you doing?
 Hey, you're not strong enough.
 You could get hurt.
 Here, I got this okay? Go get me, um, go get me something to put this in. All right?
 I'm here for the moonstone.
 Just give it to me.
 I kinda figured you'd say that.
 Come on, where is it?
 I'm sorry. I took some powder.
 Bonnie, no!
 
 You gotta stop her!
 I'm home, okay? I don't need an escort to my room.
 I already feel bad. I don't need you to berate me.
 You should admit that you never should have tried this in the first place.
 Yeah, well neither did I.
 Because I didn't want you to get hurt.
 Don't.
 Don't act like this is one-sided. Like...like I'm some kid that has a crush on his sister's friend. You could have died today.
 That was a chance I was willing to take.
 Yeah...
 It's Stefan.
 What are you guys arguing about?
 Why are you on some suicide mission?
 Oh so, bringing Klaus the moonstone so you can get yourself killed is okay?
 She took the moonstone.
 I thought she was meeting you.
 And who's on Tyler Lockwood and the full moon?
 What is it?
 Okay.
 Looks like I slept through the homecoming.
 Look, things are different now. You can't come around and start up with all this anti-vampire stuff.
 Look, if this is what you came for, just take it and go.
 I think I'll pass.
 Is there a problem here?
 What was that about?
 Hey. How's it going?
 Bonnie called. I wanted to help. How's it going?
 All right, Caroline. I get it.
 I got him. I got him.
 What kind of witch roofie was that?
 How does this work?
 You sure you're strong enough for this?
 Never gonna get used to that.
 Yeah, yeah. I'll I'll go get it.
 Looks like he's waking up.
 His sister?
 It's okay, Bonnie. We can find another way.
 
 So will Luka remember anything?
 Should we wait for Caroline?
 Yeah. Well, I hope she drops him hard.
 You think I'm hot?
 Enough already.
 Hey, whatcha doin'?
 Yeah, yeah. Me too.
 Yeah, well, uh, maybe, I don't know...Maybe you should come over tonight. We can practice. Get stronger.
 Ah, incoming.
 And?
 And I think you need to back off.
 Hey.
 No, no it's not like a "date" date. It's more of a hey, I kissed you, and I thought you liked it, um...hang thing.
 I didn't realize my sister had approval over who I'm with.
 All right, all right, so we'll, um...We'll hang out, eat some food, work on some spells. It's not a big deal. But you did...You did like it, right?
 Now that is cool. How does it work?
 So, technically, you could channel me.
 Well, I'm an element, sort of. I mean, isn't...isn't the human body mostly water?
 What the hell are you doing here?
 You okay? It's okay. What happened?
 With Katherine still around, we gotta find a way to get your powers back.
 All right, I'll see ya.
 Come on. Elena's nowhere in sight.
 Alright.
 No, after what he did to you. Look, I'm sorry, I know you feel bad about all of this but I don't.
 What's going on?
 And why would we check the house?
 I'm worried about you.
 No, I'm serious, Bonnie. The only witch that could given you your powers back is dead, and...I think you have a serious case of denial going, and I want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what, and...
 Not that denial's the worst thing.
 Did you...?
 And did he include a how?
 What exactly are we looking for?
 Are we gonna have to read through every one of these books till we find the right spell?
 Is this the spot Emily Bennett was killed, too?
 You sure it's the right place?
 I guess this is the right place.
 Are you sure about this?
 Yeah, of course I am.
 What is that?
 All right. What are they saying?
 Where are you going?
 What the hell are they saying?
 What is it?
 Bonnie? You're scaring me here.
 Bonnie!
 You okay?
 It's okay.
 All right, well, there has to be something in the grimoire to help us translate that chant.
 Heh. What kind of warning?
 Uh, look, it is important to me, okay?
 Well, exactly how much power can you draw from a hundred dead witches?
 Bonnie.
 A warning. That's all you felt like telling me? This is some kind of warning, Bonnie. It says if you use too much of your powers at once, it'll kill you. How much would it take to kill an Original?
 No. I'm not gonna let you do that.
 No one's called to get themselves killed. Plus Elena's not gonna let you die for her.
 Do you even understand what you're saying right now?
 Did you tell Elena what it's going to take for you to do that Klaus spell?
 Well, she's gotta know you can't do it.
 That's not fair. You can't harness the power of a hundred dead witches. It'll kill you.
 What? What are you gonna do?
 It's not ideal.
 It looks like she's staying on campus. Look I'm...I'm late for class.
 Wait.
 Look, I, um, I want you to have this.
 No, I'm serious, Bonnie.
 But it was made by a witch.
 Well, I have to do something. I can't just...I can't just let you get yourself killed.
 So you're saying there's a 50-50 shot you won't? Look, I'm sorry. But...you know I don't have the best luck in the girlfriend department.
 No, no, I really don't feel like dancing.
 Who knows?
 Fine. I'm fine.
 Yeah, I'm fine. I've got my ring. It's...it's Bonnie.
 If Bonnie takes on Klaus, channeling all that energy's going to kill her.
 But she doesn't want Elena to know, 'cause if Elena knows, she's gonna try to stop her. And it's Elena that could turn up dead, so...What am I supposed to do?
 What's going on, guys?
 Dude, seriously? Wrong day, wrong guy.
 Damon! Hey, I got your message, I can't find anyone. Where's Elena, where's Bonnie?
 You sure it's safe here?
 It is MiFi. If we're gonna be stuck here, then we might as well have Internet.
 Hey, look, I'm not letting you out of my sight.
 Well, um...Why don't you tell her yourself?
 This is useless. All these grimoires. There has to be something in here to keep Elena from becoming a vampire.
 Emily Bennett's, there's a section on spells she did for my ancestor, Johnathan Gilbert.
 There's something on a resuscitative spell she was working on.
 Well, maybe Johnathan wrote about it in his journals. You know, I can have Stefan bring them.
 Hey, what are you doing here?
 What's the matter?
 We already know Elena's going to come back to life. But she'll be a vampire.
 Wait, what do you mean? No, I'm coming. I need to be there. I need to make sure you guys are okay.
 I've got my own ring. Look, I'm not taking no for an answer.
 
 So you understand what happened to the child's mother after the baby was brought back to life?
 John...
 How is she?
 Yeah, take your time.
 John wanted me to give you this. 
 I still have you.
 You brought me to see a girl movie.
 Is that what we're doing? Pretending like our lives aren't screwed?
 Are we really doing this?
 All right.
 What are we eating?
 Alaric. Hey.
 She went to go see Damon. I thought that's where you were?
 You keep doing this. You left me behind before, and guess what Jenna still died. Now I'm going to find my sister. You go ahead and you try to stop me.
 Damon!
 Okay. Let's get you out of here first, all right?
 Hey, it's me. I'm with Damon at The Grill.
 Bonnie?
 What happened?
 Trying to figure out what's wrong with me. Feel different, weird.
 Bonnie, I, uh...I don't know how to thank you.
 Good night.
 Uh, no, no. I think I'm good.
 Yeah, yeah. Sure. Whatever.
 Alaric, um...Thank you for everything.
 Dude, come on! I knew you were listening.
 Alaric?
 Alaric?
 Anna?
 Vicki?
 Aaahh! Early. Bad!
 Well, maybe he'll fire me.
 You need to come home. It's boring around here without you.
 (Smiling.)
 Well it's teaching me the value of a mundane human experience.
 Nothing. Look I uh...I got to go back to work. I'll talk to you soon okay?
 Yeah, yeah. Normal and mundane. Come home soon okay.
 Vicki? (She disappears.)
 Why?
 So?
 Hey guys!
 Henry from the kitchen sold me a dime.
 You do not wanna know.
 You know I died right? And Bonnie used magic to bring me back to life?
 The thing is, ever since I came back I've been seeing...things.
 Just, things I shouldn't be seeing.
 Nah, I haven't told her. I haven't told anybody. Just messing with my head is all. I just need to chill out, so this.
 What are you doing?
 That's probably a sign you shouldn't be driving it. Need a ride?
 Ahh! What the...Vicki?!
 Nothing.
 What? No, no. I, uh, I didn't say anything.
 No...
 You know what, maybe we should just walk.
 You sure you can walk?
 Nothing.
 I've been seeing her.
 Like I said, my head's all messed up.
 You remember what we talked about last night, how I've been seeing things?
 Well, I saw her again. I saw Vicki.
 Tell Bonnie that she brought me back to life and now I'm seeing my dead girlfriend? We don't need a witch, okay? There's examples all over the Internet. We need...
 Personal items, and it works best when a family member tries to make contact.
 She said, "help me."
 I saw her, Matt. She asked for help. You were the one she loved the most. If anyone's gonna be able to help me connect to her, it's you.
 Well, everything I read said that personal items help build a stronger connection.
 It's because she's your sister and you have a chance to help her.
 Matt, please.
 Hey, don't worry about it, man. You know, it's, uh...It's a lot to ask.
 Heh. Come on in.
 You know, I don't remember her dying. I don't know if Caroline told you that when she told you everything.
 Elena made them take that memory away from me, thought I couldn't handle it. So whatever my last moment was with her, I don't have it.
 You said you needed help. Tell me how I can help you please.
 Anna!
 What are you doing here?
 Where have you been?
 You drop in, you tell me not to trust Vicki, and then you disappear?
 Yeah, yeah, I can hear you, all right? What the hell! What is it?
 You have?
 I was dreaming about you, I-
 I can't believe this is actually happening. That you're actually here.
 Bonnie!
 Anna? Look, where are you? We don't have much time.
 I'm sorry about before. I just got, um, distracted.
 Well, she's been gone all summer.
 I don't know. You know, I don't even understand how any of this is possible.
 The other side? Is that...is that what it's called?
 Wait, well what about Vicki?
 Like the windows breaking.
 Do it again.
 Wait, can't you just ask all the dead witches you were channeling?
 Since when?
 Hey, no, no, look, you don't have to apologize for anything. Okay? You didn't do anything wrong.
 No, I'm fine. You know, just been, ah, a little out of it lately. So should I concentrate on the older books? Or, uh, I mean, how old is this necklace?
 What the hell just happened?
 I'll go grab the vacuum.
 Don't.
 Bonnie's here, okay? You've got to stop.
 You...you just can't pop up every time she and I are together.
 I can't do this right now. I can't. This is just too much.
 Good-bye, Anna.
 You asked me before if something was wrong and I said no.
 That was a lie. I was lying to you. When you brought me back to life...
 Something happened...
 To me. Back around to me.
 This isn't going to work.
 No, it's okay to help.
 They're looking for a way to stop Klaus.
 Well, she doesn't want to help you.
 Ow! What the hell?!
 Mikael!
 He's a vampire and a Hunter, and you guys would be idiots to wake him.
 What do you mean, wake him?
 Thanks for the concern, dick.
 What is it?
 This is the place. It's the oldest wing of the largest cemetery in Charlotte. She said that a witch entombed him here in the nineties.
 Look there.
 So, what? It's not cool to talk to juniors anymore?
 You're mad?
 I haven't talked to Vicki in a while.
 I know that. I know. Okay? But I had to see Anna again, Bonnie. She had information that Damon needed.
 You think I want any of this?
 Dude, what are you doing over here?
 Just looking for my stoner lab partner. All right, see you around.
 He was talking to Vicki right out there in the open.
 When he died and came back, he must have started seeing her. She said that she could come back, that she had help on the other side.
 Is it even possible? Could she come back?
 Like an anchor?
 This is Vicki we're talking about. All right? She's not a bad person.
 She's on the other side, Bonnie. Okay. I thought she might know something.
 Somehow Vicki's been communicating with some super strong witch.
 Not now, Anna.
 She's just trying to help.
 Bonnie!
 Bonnie, come on. Stop dodging my calls. Don't you think we should at least talk about this?
 No kidding.
 I didn't think I was. Look, I don't know. Okay. I don't know what I'm doing, Anna. The problem is I don't think I can stop thinking about you.
 What are we going to do?
 Do you...feel this?
 What are we doing here?
 All right, that explains what you're doing here.
 You didn't miss anything.
 What's up?
 She's dead.
 And you want me to try to reach her, don't you?
 I don't even know if she's on the other side.
 That's what Anna calls it. There's not like an official brochure or anything.
 Well, Anna said it's like being here with all of us, only we can't see her or hear her. And she can't interact with anyone. She's all alone.
 Vicki had help from a witch on the other side. Anna...She's doing this all by herself.
 I don't know. I didn't have an emotional connection with her. I never even met her.
 No, no. I'm going to go, uh, check my work schedule.
 Why did you tell me to lie?
 What is going on between us? I mean, how are we able to touch? Vicki had to use magic to do that.
 This witch on the other side that gave Vicki her foothold, is she helping you now?
 Swear to me.
 I shouldn't even be talking to you. This is not okay.
 I don't know why this is happening or when it's going to stop. But before it's done...I have to do this.
 Elena...
 Hey, it's not her fault.
 I don't know. Okay? I don't know. It just...it did. Elena, please. You can't tell Bonnie.
 Anna! Anna!
 Sorry. Hey, man sorry about that.
 There you are. Is everything all right?
 Caroline? Did you find that necklace?
 Ghosts of the tomb vampires killed Tobias Fell. You might want to find that necklace before they start going alphabetically through the founding families.
 Who?
 She said she didn't take it.
 You know what, yeah, yeah, I do believe her.
 I don't know, okay? I don't even know for sure if she took the necklace.
 I know, but...
 I can touch her, Elena. I can kiss her again. And I know it's wrong, and I know that I shouldn't feel this way, but I do. I love her. I've always loved her.
 This spell is just going to break your foothold, right? You'll still be here, I'll still be able to see you. This...this doesn't have to be good-bye.
 Anna...
 You might find your mother.
 Hey, there is, Anna. Okay? There has to be. I believe that, okay?
 Look at me. You're not going to be alone. I'm not going to let you be alone.
 Bonnie!
 Bonnie...
 I owe you an explanation.
 I am sorry, Bonnie.
 But...
 So what's the point of this again?
 Profound. Alaric finds out I took this he is gonna use it on me.
 Sort of, yeah. I think he feels responsible for us.
 Yeah. Yeah-I like him. 
 Sorry, just passing through.
 Why?
 Ahh- look, can we do this later? I made plans with Tyler. He's right outside.
 I don't know...Does it matter?
 He can still hear you. He is right outside. Besides you of all people are gonna lecture me on who I can and can't hang out with?
 Yeah, whatever, this is lame. Tyler is waiting.
 All right, fine. You want me to stay in? Let's all stay in then. 
 Oh, stay. You're not doing anything.
 It was nothing.
 I don't understand.
 It was Klaus!
 I don't know.
 Wait- that's your big plan? To steal back four dead originals so this evil hybrid doesn't kill me and everyone else we know?
 Yeah! Let's get the hell outta here! Pack our bags and go!
 No, no!! I'm not gonna calm down, Elena! This happens every time, no matter what we do! Get on my case about school and work...Who cares? None of us are gonna make it out of this town alive.
 Why not? You stabbed my back, I stab yours.
 Is that why you wanted to hang out? To get me off the vervain?
 It's Klaus, Tyler! What did you think was gonna happen?
 Whenever Klaus wants something, someone ends up dead! You think about that next time before you blindly do whatever he says.
 He's not dead yet.
 Now he's dead.
 We've gotta get Alaric to the hospital now.
 So the ring brought you back to life, but it didn't heal you. Does that mean it's broken?
 He said to say you owe him a drink.
 Why wouldn't I be? I shot a hybrid in the back and chopped his head off with a meat cleaver. Typical Sunday, huh?
 What could you tell me that I don't already know? This is the way things are. It sucks but...I just gotta get used to it.
 Ahh, what did I do now?
 Elena, I didn't mean any of that.
 What's going on?
 I wasn't sure you cared.
 I think this could be a good thing. Until all this Klaus stuff blows over. I think I could have a better life there.
 What do you mean?
 You're gonna have to let me go, eventually.
 Yeah, okay, all right. Alaric's waiting.
 What are you doing here?
 Hello?
 Hey, are you checking up on me?
 Well, I'm not flunking any of my classes. Yet. And I got a dog.
 No, why? Is everything okay?
 Okay. Hey, can I call you later? I'm actually on my way out with some friends.
 Yeah. Yeah, I miss you too.
 Elena? What's wrong?
 So, you traveled across the country to get me to talk to a dead vampire?
 Well, I can't. I could talk to Anna and Vicki because I knew them. I've never even met Rose.
 Fine, fine, but can we do this later? My friend just got here and yes, Damon, I actually have some. I'll call you when I'm done.
 Hey man.
 What are you doing?!
 What?
 Did you kill him?
 So, where are we?
 I can't believe Kol was a vampire.
 Yeah, doesn't really matter.
 That's not how it works.
 Alright, you uh- you got a picture of her?
 All right, uh- tell me something about her.
 It was in the dream he gave her. She's here.
 She says not to worry, she's happy.
 She misses you.
 She uh- she misses both of you.
 She was sired by someone named Mary Porter.
 So, what's up with you and Damon?
 Are you sure about that? Cause even Rose said something.
 Elena?
 Rose found Mary. She lives in Kansas.
 This is the address.
 Why?! So you guys can make out some more??
 Sorry uh. Hey. Bonnie.
 Yeah, I know all about Alaric. When my sister stops hanging out with vampires I'll take it off.
 No, no way in hell!
 You are out of your mind!
 This is Alaric we're talking about! He looked out for us, now we need to do the same for him.
 Matt and I can leave, we can stop Esther ourselves. We just gotta find out where she is.
 Where's Elena?
 Let her go.
 Matt! Matt drop your gun!
 Damon's here. And Klaus took Esther's body.
 No, only that she tried to turn you into a weapon and failed. What's going on?
 So, what we're just gonna lock you in here and let you die?
 No, no we can't!
 Don't. Don't give me some crap speech about how I need to be the man of the house.
 Alaric.
 That's what happens when you decide to paint your dead guardian's room in the middle of the night.
 So, are you two like back together or something?
 We're fine. But, if you are trying to be the good guy again, why don't you do the right thing and give us one day. Just one day without any vampires in it.
 What the hell do you want?
 I don't know, she was just here a few minutes ago.
 I'm not giving you my ring. Let me do this.
 This is my ring, Elena's my sister. No one's gonna fight harder for her than me.
 What's wrong?
 Yeah, you wish.
 You survived Klaus. All right, make an exception, you can go back to being responsible tomorrow.
 Hey. Everyone gone?
 I hate this room.
 You forget that Alaric never wanted any of this. Once he carries out his plans, what if he decides he doesn't want to live anymore and he kills his human connection to end his life? That would mean I would lose you. I'm not gonna let that happen. 
 But she collapsed, there was blood.
 I took her to the hospital. When you find your sister unconscious, you call 911.
 Well, Meredith wants to keep her here for observation.
 Thanks man, tell the kitchen I appreciate them staying open for me.
 I don't know and even if I did, why would I tell you?
 Of course it does.
 But the only way for you to die is if Elena dies.
 What I wanna do is run in that house, grab Elena, and get her out of here and away from all this.
 Good luck getting her past all the vampires in there. Even if I wanted to help Alaric, I have no idea where Klaus' body is.
 I know where Klaus' body is.
 Damon's on his way to bury him in the woods off Route 12. I'll text you with the specifics.
 I know.
 He bought it.
 Stefan. Elena's not at home. Matt and I, we're getting her out of town.
 Matt, man, where are you guys? You should have been back by now.
 Haven't you done enough? And how'd you even get in here?
 Ric?
 I don't understand.
 Oh my God, you're a ghost. But if you're dead, that means Elena...
 Are you okay? I watched Vicki go through this, she was a mess. Her emotions were all over the place. All these old memories came flooding back.
 No, you're not. You're you. You act like everything's okay so no one worries about you but you need help.
 Yeah, she said when I was shot; she made some plea to the witch spirits to bring me back and they listened.
 And what could be more horrible than you turning into a vampire? I need my sister, not another one of them.
 I hope so.
 Was that it? Is that all we can do?
 What? Do it.
 The Other Side? The Other Side is for dead people.
 Even if it does, how can you get there? You're not dead.
 No! No, Bonnie!
 Assuming you wake up!
 A new source of power?! What kind of power is going to let you kill yourself and bring someone back with you from the dead?
 Oh my God.
 Bonnie. Bonnie, open your eyes. Bonnie, I can't let you do this! Bonnie, you're dying!
 What the hell is that?!
 Bonnie, no! Bonnie! Bonnie, wake up! Bonnie! Wake up!
 Bonnie, wake up! Wake up! Come on. Open your eyes.
 You're awake!
 You're alive.
 She said she's not strong enough.
 He's bluffing. He needs a witch to do that.
 This is black magic. She shouldn't be doing this.
 Bonnie, what are you doing?
 Bonnie, it worked. Stop.
 They're paper lanterns. The student council made them for after the Memorial. We light them up in honor of all the dead.
 Yeah, I wouldn't make that crack in front of Elena.
 I guess she's fine, considering.
 Yeah.
 April?
 You look great! 
 Your dad. Oh my God, I am so sorry about your dad.
 
 I don't know.
 An assassination attempt on the Mayor's son.
 Nice ink.
 You didn't see his tattoo? It was huge.
 Yeah, he did.
 
 Do you mind telling me who you are and why I'm here? I mean, I'm happy to miss Bio but...
 
 It's a tattoo, big deal.
 
 Why the show and tell? I don't even know you.
 Well, how am I supposed to do that?
 No, but I know where you can find one. There's a doctor, Meredith Fell. She uses vampire blood in surgery. I think she has a deal with one, her blood for his.
 Is that where we're going?
 That's her.
 See? I told you I could be a badass.
 I'm not helping you with anything.
 You were trying to hurt people who are important to me.
 And what exactly do you understand? Because a couple days ago, you seemed to have all the answers and now you know jack. Where did this tattoo come from? Why am I the only one who can see it?
 Who was he?
 I'm done.
 It's the tattoo.
 That's all of it. He says every time he kills a vampire it spreads.
 At least let April go. She doesn't have anything to do with this.
 Our conversation? Are you saying someone compelled me?!
 I don't know. Maybe. Maybe I just can't remember.
 You said we had a conversation yesterday.
 About what?
 What is all that?
 And what's the point? What do you get out of all this?
 They're not all bad, you know. Some of them, they're my friends.
 What happened to her?
 So, you killed your own friend?!
 Stefan!
 Elena, get out of here!
 Hey, it's okay. You don't have to hide it. I know you're not going to hurt me.
 He said I was like him, because I could see his tattoo.
 His hunter's mark. It's invisible to everyone but me. Stefan and Damon didn't tell you about it?
 Well, that's the thing, I don't even know. Apparently, I was with Connor all day yesterday, but I can't remember. Someone compelled me.
 Yeah, I heard about that.
 You know what, it's okay, I, uh, I need to get home anyways. I'm feeling a little over it today.
 Hey, April!
 Did you drop this?
 You sure? Hey, let me see your wrist.
 Yeah.
 I'm just sick of all the secrets, you know.
 What?
 Nothing.
 What happened?
 Hey, do you see anything on my hand?
 What if I told you I saw the beginning of a mark like Connor's?
 It showed up after he died. He told me that I was a potential. That that's why I could see his mark.
 No idea.
 Is everything okay? Is it Elena?
 Great, give me a stake, I'll kill Damon right now.
 I'm pretty sure that's just for the contestants.
 Well, she needed a date and apparently you were taken.
 No, wait.
 You want to see something cool?
 Ever since I was awoken as a Hunter, I've had all this energy, like all the time.
 Hey, I would never hurt my sister.
 I'll be fine.
 Need a hand?
 I really wish you'd stop acting like you were still my sister.
 What if I'm turning into Alaric? I've probably died too many times with this ring on my finger and I'm developing an alter ego like he did.
 Fine, I'll tell her when I see her.
 Uh, no. Go ahead, I'll meet you there.
 What am I doing here?
 You have no idea.
 Who is that?
 What is this? All so I can stake him?
 Stefan, what are you doing?! What the hell is wrong with you!?
 Sorry, Stefan, but I can't trust you.
 I said I can't.
 I am not telling you anything.
 I guess I can't be compelled anymore.
 Hey, sorry, I, um, I got stuck at work.
 No, no, I knew the dance. I watched some lesson online like a hundred times.
 Hey, what's that Shane guy doing here?
 Your dad?
 Your dad was doing the right thing for this town. The whole Council was. They died heroes.
 Connor was right. All I can think about is killing vampires.
 I want to believe that. And I know I don't want to hurt you, but everything inside of me is telling me to drive this stake through your heart.
 And you're a vampire.
 No.
 Get out of here, Matt.
 Shut up, Matt!
 I can't keep living here if I want to kill my sister.
 What?
 Where's Elena gonna go?
 They shouldn't be here.
 Yeah. Yeah, I trust you.
 You can come in.
 
 Did it work?
 You.
 I feel that way about you.
 Elena.
 
 Hey, check this out.
 Thank you.
 
 Did you see that?
 Then teach me something useful. We've been here for days, and so far, all you've done is bark orders.
 What? You're going to starve us now?
 Don't act like you care about my life. You care about the hunter's mark and curing Elena so she's not sired to your ass.
 Maybe. Why? Running out of voicemails to listen to?
 What the hell are you doing here?
 Hey, what are you doing here?
 Well, I'm about to go take a shower, but you're more than welcome to wait inside.
 What the hell...?
 You said you were going to convince Klaus to do this another way!
 No way. I'm not doing this.
 Screw you. You said I wouldn't have to kill any innocent people.
 I don't take orders from you, dick. 
 Are you okay?
 We don't have a second. They can smell your blood. We need to go.
 You set us up.
 
 They're going to kill Matt.
 Keep going. We're almost there.
 Get to the house! Hurry!
 They're coming.
 Sun's up. They're long gone.
 Wait. Now this is my fault?
 Do you really think they went back to the bar?
 Fine. Let's get this over with.
 Save the teaching moment. Elena's not here. You don't have to pretend like you give a damn about me.
 What the hell happened?
 Kol?
 
 Elena, we're in trouble.
 Listen to me. Kol attacked us. I barely got away, but he has Damon.
 
 Seriously? You still trust Damon?
 He saved the map to the cure. He couldn't care less about me.
 Don't. Whatever's inside of me that makes me want to hunt, right now it's on overdrive.
 
 Worth a shot. 
 I think I'll pass. I've killed enough people for you today.
 This is never gonna end. If Kol doesn't kill me first, then Klaus is just gonna force me to kill more innocent people. How many is it gonna take, 10? 100?
 I'm training.
 
 You can come in.
 Bonnie, where are you? I called like seventeen times. Kol is in our house. We need you. Okay, I'm heading to your house now.
 Is Bonnie here?
 It's important.
 I've called you like a hundred times. Kol is in our house.
 Bonnie, we don't have time for this.
 My sister's in trouble. We need Bonnie's help.
 That's Bonnie. She was right behind me.
 You kill us, you'll never get to the cure. You'll never be able to make any more hybrids.
 Come in.
 It didn't work.
 What if it doesn't?
 If we don't, we might as well look up Katherine Pierce and see if she wants some company in hiding, 'cause he will come after us.
 It's happening.
 You can see it?
 Doesn't bother me.
 So, Qetsiyah killed the other woman?
 Does it say anything about the hunter's purpose in all this?
 Ugh, I'm out of water.
 A magic well? Seriously?
 
 You okay?
 It's okay.
 
 Yeah, of course.
 
 All right, where is this stupid magic passage she needs to open?
 You can do this. Remember, just like you taught me. You're in control.
 Bonnie! Bonnie!
 
 I'm glad we're here together.
 
 How do you know?
 Bonnie, what's going on?
 Bonnie, stop! 
 Silas. He was in your head. He was trying to control you.
 You need to block him out of your mind. Close your eyes. 
 
 It's stuck. Help me move it.
 What? 
 How's that?
 Ah, come on!
 Bonnie! 
 You stabbed my friend!
 
 Don't! The hunter's curse!
 Elena's here now, okay? Everything's gonna be all right.
 
 I'm fine. What are you doing?
 It'll be there after we help Bonnie. 
 
 Katherine.
 Bonnie?
 It hurts.
 Help me.
 Bonnie.
 Wake up.
 
 Open your eyes. Bonnie, open your eyes!
 Does it matter? 
 Do you miss me, Bonnie?
 Do you want this to be real?
 Then it can be. Bonnie...your magic can bring me back for good. You have the power to do the spell now.
 How many times do I need to kill you?
 Elena! 
 Hey.
 Thank you, Bonnie.
 Mm.
 She just got her humanity back. Let her live a little.
 I'm dead – what are they gonna do, throw me in juvie?
 Hey, no. No tears. If Caroline was right, we only have until tonight. We need a no-crying rule.
 Look, Elena. You're my sister and I love you, no matter what you choose.
 What about the cure?
 Then it's settled. You're going to your graduation.
 I don't care. Mom and Dad would kill you if there wasn't a photo of you in your graduation getup.
 Lexi'll keep me company. You're going.
 Hey.
 I needed to see you.
 I get it. I'm ready. I just...wanted to be with you when it happened.
 I can't. I can't say goodbye to her. We said 'no tears' and...I left her a letter. She'll find it when all this is over. I'm ready.
 So this is it? 'Cause there were a million things I wanted to say to you, but now nothing seems quite right.
 What's happening?
 What is it?
 I'm alive?
 I can't feel your hand. What's going on, Bonnie? Why can't I feel you?
 Bonnie, what did you do?
 No...No! No, you can't be dead.
 I can't. They need to know.
 "Dear Elena..."
 It's bad enough you're dead – now you're a control freak?
 All right, fine. How about, "Hey Elena, what's up?"
 I did...five hours ago.
 There were issues at home. Ever since I lost my parents, my aunt, I've been acting out...drugs, drinking. I was looking for attention, so I lit my house on fire and faked my own death.
 Or I could just not go back, considering my school already had a memorial for me.
 Hey, I'll see you on laundry day.
 Caroline says, "Get your ass to Whitmore, Bonnie. We need you."
 You realize you're just postponing the inevitable, right? What happens when your dad finds out you've been dead all summer?
 What about Elena?
 How many best friends can't feel each other?
 I should get going. The freak who faked his own death can't also be late for math.
 Leave me alone, Damon.
 Says the guy who once killed me.
 Does that mean I don't have to go back to school?
 Hey, Stefan. Glad you're back.
 Something's wrong. When he touched me, I felt a chill where my tattoo was.
 Right before I died, Silas grabbed me and I felt the same thing.
 
 I'm a hunter. Our whole reason for existing is to kill him. I know what I'm feeling, Damon. That - that was Silas.
 What did he want?
 Hey.
 You said not to tell you.
 We just passed Old Miller Road.
 Shut up, Katherine!
 Hey, what the hell!
 Hey...please...
 
 You didn't tell her Silas was here.
 So you lied.
 I want to.
 I didn't...but Matt did.
 She was mid-cat-fight with some lady who maced her. We think Silas might have mind-controlled himself some new friends.
 Bullet would've been more effective, but we're trying to be nice. You crashed my car and left me to die.
 You're not getting out of the car because you want an aspirin.
 Hurry.
 Silas knows I'm with you. Sorry, I can't risk being seen.
 Stop. Running.
 Don't even think about it.
 Keyword  was.
 Get in the truck and drive.
 I can't leave Matt.
 That's why people treat you like an object and not like a person.
 Matt!
 Too bad you can't get inside my head to find out for sure. Hunter's perk.
 You can try, but none of your abilities work on me, so right now, you're nothing. Slower than a vampire, weaker than a vampire. I, on the other hand, am a hunter.
 Plus, I work out.
 I thought you didn't know how to use that.
 Yeah, Silas killed you, tried to kill me, then—
 Hey, I left a hatchet, I'll be right back.
 Hey. Are you okay?
 It's okay. We'll get through this. I can tell everybody that you're with family, that it was too hard for you to be here. I might not be able to touch you, or hold you, but I'm here for you, no matter what you need.
 Hurry.
 Silas knows I'm with you, so I can't risk being seen.
 Sorry. I, uh...I just went for a run. What are you doing here?
 I was just working off the extra adrenaline.
 So, is this our new thing? You make dead jokes while I avoid all of our friends on your behalf?
 But they don't know that because they don't know you're dead. They're waiting for you to help them because that's what you do. You help.
 I want to, Bon, but not like this.
 Hey.
 Yeah. Yeah. What's going on?
 Okay. Weird.
 How many times have you died wearing the Gilbert ring?
 What's with the camera?
 
 I don't know. She hasn't mentioned anything.
 I got to go.
 Hello.
 I need you to come meet me, and I need you to come alone.
 I know where Bonnie is. Get over here and I'll explain.
 That's the problem. I can't actually call her. No one can.
 I've been lying to everyone for months, and I can't keep lying knowing that everyone's waiting for her to swoop in and save the day.
 Think about it, Damon. I was dead. I wasn't supposed to come back.
 You're not hearing me. Magic finds a balance. I'm not supposed to be here.
 You can't just bring sombody back from the dead. There is always a price to pay for it.
 She didn't show up to her dad's funeral, Damon. Nobody has spoken to her all summer.
 Bonnie's dead.
 I'm sorry. People need to know.
 I've been knocking.
 Matt, wait. There's something I need to tell you. It's about Bonnie.
 We ring this bell in honor of Bonnie, in remembrance for her. 
 She says that she's not going anywhere, that she has been here all along. Bonnie has watched you have the summer of your life.
 She's actually right over there.
 What are you talking about?
 Wait. You want to work with Silas?
 He already tried to bring down the veil to the Other Side. He failed.
 She thinks Silas wants to destroy the Other Side completely.
 She's in!
 So I can lie for you all summer as your witch translator, but when it's something I want 
 And bringing me back to life wasn't? Oh, right. It killed you.
 Now she needs you.
 What is worse than this? What is worse than seeing you and hearing you...
 We're just supposed to believe that he's going to bring Bonnie back to life out of the goodness of his heart?
 What for?
 
 Okay. Where is this stupid anchor thing?
 What does it look like?
 Bonnie! What are you doing here?
 Don't jinx it.
 Not okay. Have some faith. If you believe that it can work, and I believe it can work, then it will work. Just say it. You need to say it.
 Thank you.
 Before today is over, we're gonna know what.. 
 We can't kill Silas. Silas is the only one who can bring Bonnie back and he's not going to bring her back until right before he destroys the Other Side.
 Damon, you promised. You promised Elena that she would see Bonnie again.
 Bonnie, she's my sister.
 We were so close.
 What?
 We couldn't get Bonnie back. I get a pass.
 No. No, I won't because it's not.
 Bonnie's here. She wants us not to worry.
 It turns out that it's not gonna be that easy to keep Amara alive.
 Bon, there's something I want to tell you. Actually, there are three things that I want to tell you.
 
 I know one way or another that you will always be here. The second is thank you for giving your life up for me.
 And the third is 
 I'm not sure it works like that.
 How's our mental patient doing?
 Relax. I'm  I"m just bringing dinner.
 I don't think so.
 I was. I came back.
 Can you see people on the Other Side?
 Okay. That's weird.
 Amara could see Bonnie, and Bonnie could touch her. They made physical contact. It's like Amara's got a foot on each side or something.
 The point is if Silas isn't gonna help us, what if Bonnie could be the same thing? What if she existed on both sides at once? What if she became the anchor?
 What are you talking about? Tessa's doing the spell.
 No, that's impossible...Damon–
 Bon...
 I love you.
 I'm not ready to let you go.
 I can feel you.
 Bonnie, it worked.
 I missed this. Holding your hand.
 I am never gonna let you go again.
 We could always sneak back to my place.
 You okay?
 Yep. 
 Sorry. Pretty much had to wrestle Elena to get her to give me these. 
 Good. I'm gonna need you to come with me.
 To register for classes.
 Step away from the candles.
 What?
 Bonnie, what's going on? Bonnie! 
 How often does that happen? 
 What?
 Damon dumped Elena.
 I have no idea.
 I don't think so.
 She fed me to Silas and I died.
 Then, she made me crash my car into a pole and left me for dead...again.
 He might have deserved that.
 That might win.
 I don't see any freshly dug ground.
 It doesn't matter. We've all slept with our fair share of bad choices.
 No. Obviously not you.
 Why don't we split up and think about that?
 We are waiting for Katherine to bite the bullet.
 Alaric!
 Where the hell have you been? I thought you bailed on us to go find peace, or something.
 He says you're a dick.
 So, we're going to a dance, but we can't show up together because you can't bring a date?
 Better idea. Let's get another hotel room instead.
 Bonnie, we're happy. Can't we just act like it?
 You're not funny. Let's get out of here.
 Hey!
 Hey! Leave her alone.
 Are you deaf? She is not helping you. You're not gonna hurt me. Elena would 
 What are you going to do? I'm sure killing me would really inspire her.
 Oh, my God. You don't have to do this.
 I'm not saying you don't deserve it. Besides her birthday isn't until next week.
 No, she's been possessed by her evil doppelgänger.
 Umm, same colored hair...
 Stefan said we should bury her in the woods.
 You need some help?
 Elena; what's going on?
 Hey! You're lucky I'm even helping you! Considering the last thing you did for me was to tell Enzo to strangle me to death.
 Yep.
 I don't know.. Does she?
 Yeah. How are you feeling?
 Same here.
 Someone wants to speak to you.
 Woah! What the hell?
 I can't! You'll kill her.
 What the hell is a silencing spell?
 Okay, so trust me. Tell me what's going on.
 I thought travelers were witches.
 Mystic Falls? Why?
 Is everything okay?
 Wait, you lay all this on me and now you're just leaving?
 Is Elena with you? I think she's in trouble.
 Liv is up to something. She said Elena is important to the travelers.
 Look, I'll tell you everything later, but I gotta go find Elena.
 If you want to kill Liv, you're going to have to kill me too.
 What are you waiting for, Damon? Go on. It wouldn't be the first time you killed me.
 No, she won't. She's gonna help keep Elena safe. I will make sure of that.
 Trust me, I won't let anyone hurt you.
 How can you expect me to care about school, when this is my life? I mean, take a look around, it's not like I can bring my teachers a note, saying "Sorry I missed class today. We were under doppelgänger invasion." But I know what I'm doing. Please. Liv knows more about the travelers than she's letting on.
 So here's plan C. You're going to protect Elena and I'm going to help you stop the travelers.
 I'm going to need some help.
 They're part of the deal. Take it or leave it.
 Matt and Tyler said I can stay at their place for a little while.
 No. We won't. I should've moved out a long time ago.
 And you know that they are always going to be crazy. And I need to figure out how to deal with crazy on my own. Right now, this is what's best for me... for all of us. I'm not asking for permission.
 Just do it so we can get on with this.
 Ok. So we're all in the clear. Want to tell us exactly what we're doing here?
 Bonnie.
 Yeah, I know, I know. Sorry. I, um I've just been busy moving and stuff.
 What do you mean?
 I can't. I'm sorry. We have this handled. I just I need you to trust me, ok?
 I told you I didn't want to keep any secrets.
 I just realized you're the only person in this office the sheriff hasn't killed.
 Bonnie, look. I'm sorry for everything. This whole thing with Liv, it had nothing to do with her. I was just trying to protect you.
 I know. Because of Anna. Look. I know I messed up.
 You died and came back from the other side.
 Wait. You saw vicki?
 Ugh! Whose nasty-ass boxers are under the couch?
 Or the kitchen cabinets or the garage or the bookshelves. The Traveler knife is gone.
 Well, obviously not.
 We can't find it.
 Tyler said he hid it in the piano.
 We think Tyler's with the Travelers.
 Ok. You've got your superserious face on.
 Bon, come on. What is it?
 Bonnie, what's going on?
 What are we gonna do about the other side slipping off into oblivion and you with it?
 I'm just saying that I would enjoy this weekend a whole lot more if I knew we were gonna be able to keep doing it.
 No more secrets, remember? Tyler's back. We should get over there. Let me grab my stuff.
 Trust me, neither was I.
 One part wolfsbane, one part vervain. All together, the dumbest idea that either of you have ever had.
 He wants to kill my sister. I want to stop him.
 Why do we care?
 Try to think of them as romantic Travelers and romantic caves since we're technically still on our date weekend.
 I take it back. This is creepy.
 That's what he said.
 I'm pretty sure that's a dove.
 Look. I'm sorry. This is the worst date ever.
 But we'll find it. We just need to figure out where they went.
 Tyler, talk to us.
 Tyler?
 You called?
 Get in.
 Be careful
 I walked around Mystic Falls this morning to see where my hunter instincts disappeared.
 Meaning that I have a supernatural urge to kill vampires, so wherever I hated you less, there was no magic.
 I should go with you.
 At least tell me how this works.
 What about you? What happens?
 Yeah, but how do you get through?
  I'm sure the Salvatores will make a generous contribution to help fix it.
 Except I wouldn't be able to invite my girlfriend over.
 We're here.
 You told me you could come back.
 So none of it was true?
 Bonnie. Don't move!  Okay, I—I'm coming to you.
 No! NO! Don't you dare hang up on me.
 Bonnie. Don't you dare.
 I need to get to Bonnie.
 Bonnie! Bonnie!
 Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie!
 Or what? You're gonna come here and make me?
 How? By joining the community protection squad? What exactly are you protecting us from? Bike theft? Litter? Magic doesn't work here. The town's safe.
 No more magic means I'm not a hunter anymore. (opens can)
 Well it's not yours either.
 Caroline compelled her to forget Elena attacked her. It's not a big deal.
 You gonna erase Bonnie from your head too?
 It's dark out.
 He's trying to give me purpose.
 Didn't feel like it.
 Ah! You scared the hell out of me.
 What are you? Deputy Dewey? How do you know that?
 Matt, at least let her stay until she finds her Dad.
 Alright fine, we can go stay at Stefan and Damon's, no one's there.
 It's not like she can do anything about it.
 You'd be surprised. You want bourbon? Or bourbon?
 Trust me, it's not.
 You ever think about asking her?
 Gotcha, sorry.
 Elena.
 No. I brought the girl Caroline compelled to forget you attacked. She doesn't know anything.
 Because she looks good in a bikini. Can I go now?
 Aren't we supposed to be having fun?
 Hey. Weren't you getting ice?
 How?
 Wait. Halfway to the sip and serve? Where is that specifically?
 Have you guys seen Sarah?
 There's no ice.
 Caroline compelled that girl to go get ice. She didn't.
 No. She had to go into Mystic Falls to get it. She had to cross the border.
 Which means that every memory you compelled away came back, so Sarah, the girl you attacked (looking at Elena)and you compelled (looking at Caroline)...
 I keep looking in town. I call you if I find anything.
 I did my part, she is definitely not hiding in the Salvatore liquor cabinet.
 Really?
 You call this a fair fight? You're basically an Original vampire.
 Happy?
 My problem is that everyone thinks I shouldn't have one. I have the right to be messed up right now. Bonnie is dead. She knew it was gonna happen, and she said goodbye over the phone! Just so you  (He realizes what he's about to say and cuts himself off, glaring at Alaric)
 You, Elena, Stefan, Tyler, Enzo? She saved everybody but herself!
 Sarah?
 Hey, just take it easy. What do you want?
 Your dad is Zach Salvatore.
 Out
 Just... later, okay?
 I can't do this right now!
 I just need to get out of here
 Says the freak who's stalking my sister.
 Why didn't she come back?
 You know, I paid her cell bill so I could call her phone and hear her say the same six words every day.
 Why? She hated you.
 COME ON! NO! DAMN IT!
 I keep trying to cancel Bonnie's phone, but I can't without her PIN. Why can't I remember her PIN? (In anger, he slams the phone down on the pool table, smashing it into pieces. He holds up his hand, which is cut open with jagged pieces of the broken phone embedded in it and is shaking slightly. He then smashes his hand through a bottle of alcohol that sits on the pool table. Glass flies everywhere, and he punches his fist over and over again into the pool table until Matt and Sarah grab each of his arms and hold him back).
 Get off! Get off!
 No, it's not! She's gone! Bonnie is gone.
 Seriously, I shouldn't be winning.
 You mean, you can cheat.
 Doubt they'd mind.
 He canceled Bonnie's cell phone, cried until there was nothing left, and got all the grief out of his system. He is ready to move on.
 What?
 Damon said she found peace.
 So you're back to defending him. Wow! And all it took was one hollow promise to bring Bonnie back.
 And if you can't?
 You're right, Elena. This is good news. Tonight, I'm gonna see Bonnie again, and everything is gonna go back to the way it was because I have never heard that before.
 Let me guess. She's not with you?
 But at the last minute, something went wrong, and it didn't work. I bet Damon's fine, isn't he?
 Why not?
 Why?
 Who was that?
 You tell him we're busy hunting down a psychopath roaming outside Mystic Falls?
 Let's kill a vampire.
 Ugh. Wouldn't it be a billion times easier just to stake him in the heart?
 Wait. This isn't about making him suffer. It's about making sure he doesn't kill anyone else.
 Dude, you sound like Tripp.
 I'm just saying you're being a little intense.
 So what, you'd do the same thing to Stefan? What about Elena or Caroline?
 Look. I know how you feel. I was supernaturally programmed to take out my sister, remember, but this whole us versus them thing is gonna drive you crazy, and it's gonna get you killed.
 We miss you, Bonnie.
 Sorry, I forgot you lived here. (leaves kitchen)
 There is. Right here.
 Well, we're not letting Kai kill Elena.
 Little busy here. (exhales and continues to lift)
 I know what today is.
 So we're throwing a birthday
 I'm not. The only
 Doesn't matter. I'm not
 What the hell's he doing
 People don't just change
 You seriously buy this?
 We should trust a guy that
 Bonnie? Bonnie! She can't
 Can she do that? Can she die
 We get it. For whoever's not
 How? She couldn't hear us.
 What if you just send me
 Don't. Don't say anything.
 Ok. 1994. Let's do this.
 It's working.
 (flips through the atlas)
 Kai? (Jeremy and Kai are
 No! What are you doing?
 Send me back. (Kai wheezes
 I need to stop Bonnie.
 Stay here. (walks after
 (Tries to touch her, but
 Bonnie.
 Come on, Bonnie. Get up!
 Come on! Get up! (Tries to
 Bonnie, get up! (repeatedly
 I'm ok.
 I saw her. Sh-she's gonna be
 I don't think Bonnie would
 Don't tell me I got to be
 What about you?
 To Matt's phone, which is clearly more important than my last day in town.
 He broke up with his girlfriend. He gets a free pass. Look. I want to take this shot before Alaric changes his mind about letting me drink.
 Cheers.
 You're gonna make your girlfriend give me an STD test again?
 Ha ha ha! Why is Enzo still alive, and why is he calling you?
 He was OK with it?
 Damon gave it to me, and technically, it's from Ric's girlfriend's stash.
 Yeah. Ric left. He was worried someone might recognize him when he's supposed to be dead.
 That's the understatement of the century.
 What, really?
 Let me have your car.
 Oh, come on. I'm moving to a new town, starting a new life. I need a car.
 Just compel yourself a new one.
 Mom and dad's station wagon. That's one.
 Katherine wrapped my car around a light post. That's 3.
 Yeah, they did. You just ate them all. (Snickers)
 Dude, just click ignore.
 Don't be stupid.
 But I never thought that made you a bad sister. If anything, it was nice to have someone to go through it with. When you got better, that's when I felt the most alone. That wasn't your fault. You were healing. I wasn't.
 Enzo's a dick is what happened.
 I don't need my big sister beating up bullies, thanks. What'd the sheriff want?
 Then what was it... A vampire attack, a werewolf in the road? What else could we possibly go through?
 I... I used to smoke pot in my room. Mom caught me that night. She said she was gonna have me arrested. So she called the sheriff. She was pretending to be all business, but I could hear Jenna giggling outside. It was the last time we spoke, fighting through a door.
 What happened? Sheriff ok?
 I can't leave now, no way, not with the sheriff sick and Enzo on a rampage. It's not the right time.
 I'll call you when I get to the airport and when I land.
 Wait. Hang on. You're giving me your car?
 I'm on it.
 Yeah. Elena will be fine as long as she thinks that I'm safe.
 But?
 Yeah, turns out a social life isn't as much fun as kicking vampire ass.
 You already went over this. No one needs to worry about me, ok? Ha ha! All right. It's not like I'm not gonna have e-mail or anything.
 Hey, do me a favor. If Bonnie ever comes back...
 
 Alaric?
 I I tried to be here sooner. I wanted to be here for the wedding.
 Yeah. Three canceled flights. I could have walked here faster.
 Hey  when you do wake up, I want you to know that I spent my life doing exactly what I felt I was born to do. I was happy.
