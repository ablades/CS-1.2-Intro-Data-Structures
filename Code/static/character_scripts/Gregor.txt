 Jaryakat a zem. Daryeet acza.
 You can call me whatever you want...when I'm gutting you.
 You, back in that tomb, sealed away for eternity.
 
 So you slit my throat?!
 So now what? I am just a passenger that you can call out of Matt's head and put away whenever you want?
 Tell me where you buried my body.
 
 What do you want?
 To track and kill Silas.
 How did you get that?
 Fine. After Silas was dead, I was meant to kill her. 
 That's what the Travelers want. I don't question my orders.
