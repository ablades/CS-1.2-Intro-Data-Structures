 Oh! Nice. Vickies from Vicki. Ha!
 Vicki brought the party police.
 Excuse me. Should have been watching where I was going.
 Have a nice day.
 There I go again. Bumping into people...
 Let's not and say we did. Why don't you two meet us at the hospital?
 You can still save his life, Elena. Here, take my blood.
 I can't get in. You're gonna have to invite me.
 Klaus asked for his family. You didn't deliver.
 He's gonna die. Might want to invite me in, Elena.
 Uh, excuse me, Caroline.
 Uh, your fianc√© just called.
 
 He's curious what your schedule is right before the wedding.
 I think he wants to plan a trip to Mystic Falls.
 Mmhmmm
