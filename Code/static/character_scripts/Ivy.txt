 Your fridge makes me want to kill myself. We're gonna have to split this.
 So. You want to grab dinner? There's that crab shack on the harbor you want to check out.
 Yeah, never heard that one before.
 Hey, I'm not asking for your hand in marriage. Stefan, come on. We've been hanging out for two months now. I don't know anything about you or your family. Your friends you never talk about call you and you get all weird.
 Yeah. You get weird. So, we'll play a game. You tell me one thing about you and I'll tell you one thing about me.
 
 You're so annoying.
 Hey.
 Um, I'm I mean I thought it would be nice to d completely overstay my welcome.
 I'm sorry, I thought I never mind what I thought.
 Right. Because why should you expect someone you spent the night with to make assumptions about breakfast. I'm gonna go.
 No, Stefan I get it. I am super into you, you're intermittently into me. Breakfast, bad.
 Hey.
 I ran into some of your friends.
 So, how do you guys know Stefan?
 Oh, Thank you. I think.
 I've...never really thought about it.
 No, more than that, remember? We met two months ago and you already had it.
 OH MY GOD!
 Um, I-I don't 
 Hey, did your friends leave?  Whoa, what happened?
 Stefan, I don't feel so good. Your friend Enzo made me drink his blood, and now I'm so thirsty.
 I should probably tell you I killed your boss. Dean? I woke up and he was burying me in the woods, I drank every drop of his blood. It wasn't enough.
 Then why aren't you helping me?
 Two blood bags and a lesson on sunlight? Wow, thanks a million.
 Hey, I am dead because of you. Because you lied to me about who you were. Because your friend Enzo turned me into something straight out of Buffy the Vampire Slayer!
 You think? Look at me, I used to be a decent person, I got good grades, I went home for Christmas, I had a freaking Etsy store!
 And now, I am a killer. And all I am going to do is kill more, and more, and it's all your fault.
 Where am I? What did you do?
 Then Stefan broke my neck and I woke up in a trunk.
 When do we eat?
 What do you think?
 So you'd rather be locked in a dorm room with a newbie vampire?
 Whoa. Just realized why Stefan brought me here to learn control. Just do yourself a favor. Unwind. Just admit you have a thing for him.
 I saw the way you looked at him that night you came over for dinner. You practically cut his food for him!
 Done. See? I'm fine, you already put your number into my phone as my emergency vampire contact. I know I burn in the sun, we covered compulsion and snatch, eat, erase. Look, it's getting dark. Let's go party. You can teach me how to eat someone without killing them.
 Can we at least play a board game or do something non-vampire related.
 I don't know, Scrabble?
 Really? That wasn't scary... But this is.
 I snatched, I ate, now... ERASE!
 I-I don't think I did it right. You should go. Run! SERIOUSLY!
 I suck at this.
 I did a really bad thing.
 Okay, two bad things. Look, I'm sorry-
 Where are you? I have been standing here for a hundred years.
 I'm fine.
 Please. Just. Go.
 Please, just let me go!
 Why are you doing this?
 Come on, come on, come on, come on!
 What is happening!?
