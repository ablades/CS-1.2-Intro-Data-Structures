 Go away, go away. Leave me alone.
 Silas.
 How is this possible? Silas, how are you here? After all this time...
 She lied. She couldn't kill me. There was only one cure. She wanted it for you.
 The cure runs in your veins.
 I love you, Silas. I'm so sorry. 
 Stop talking. It's not up to you. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Please, leave me alone. Leave me alone.
 Are you real?
 I don't know! I don't know.
 I said I don't know!
 Leave me alone.
 I said I don't know!
 Ahhhh! No! No! Let me die. I want to die!
 I know you.
 You're the hunter. 
 How? I said, how? 
 Of course I can see you. I'm not blind. I have eyes. Or are you dead? I get so mixed up. I can't tell the difference between the living or the dead.
 I am the anchor to the Other Side. I can see everything.
 Don't touch me! Please don't  don't touch me.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 That is what you want to hear, isn't it? How I have suffered, how every moment of my life has been a living hell? It has! 
 What is that?
 A grim what?
 I've been through worse.
 
 Silas, please. I'm ready.
 Silas!
 
 I've been in hell for two thousand years.
 Let me die.
