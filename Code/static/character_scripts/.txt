 HAWT-E. STARING @ U.
 Are you going?
 Not bad. Have you been eating bunnies?
 I don't need her to be dead, but...you might.
 What attacked you the other night?
 This is Logan Fell coming to you live from the streets of Mystic Falls with breaking news of another deadly animal attack. The wild animal terrorizing the citizens of Mystic Falls has claimed another victim, local high school student Elena Gilbert. Police are certain that forensic evidence will confirm that this is the same animal responsible for recent attacks.
 I can confirm that a 12-foot puma mountain lion attacked a hunter and was subsequently shot and killed. The hunter is in stable condition.
 To repeat, the animal terrorizing Mystic Falls has been caught.
 Logan, what happened?! Logan?
 Sheriff, yeah, it’s Damon.
 Where is Caroline?
 She’s ok. I’m on Elm Street.
 I found one. After years of research and study, there it was right in front of me. I was terrified. As I stared it in the eyes, I drove a stake through its heart. I was right about Mystic Falls. There is evil here. I can sense it. Feel it. It's everywhere.
 Look, no one knows where I am. Can we please just go back?
 You went to college?
 She's a witch.
 "How do you become a vampire?"
 "Brad Pitt changed me".
 "Go to Vegas. Ask for Wayne Newton".
 "How do you kill a vampire?"
 "The blood of Paula Abdul".
 Great.
 "Serious answers only please".
 "Stake in the heart always works".
 "You're a believer?"
 "Aren't you?"
 Oh my god yes!
 Stefan Salvatore.
 Everything okay?
 You're given up already?
 Hey, want to come take a look at this for me?
 It wasn't that bad.
 I'm sorry man.
 I'll take her home.
 Could you help me out a little bit?
 Turn that down. It's too quiet.
 Hey, Jer...What what's going on? Oh, no.
 Elena!
 Jenna.
 I'm always sensitive.
 Oh my god John! It's so good to see you. How have you been?  No, I can't.
 Meaning he doesn't want to cancel the Founders' Day Kick-off Party.
 Why does she hate you?
 No Elena, I will not go to your bedroom with you.
 I was looking for you.
 Is that soda?
 It's not worth my time.
 Mom!!!!
 Thank you for your help.
 Everything's fine. Everything is fine. Come on, everybody, back to the party. Let's go. Come on, have a good time!
 Mom!!! Don't you get it? I'm better off without you.
 I know what you meant.
 What are you talking about?
 Do you see Stefan down there?
 If I do this, if I give in, there's no going back.
 You didn't see anything?
 Her mother's name is Pearl?
 Stop saying that!!!
 Circle around that way. I'll distract them. Go. Over here! There's another one! Quick! Help me!
 Yeah.
 You don't have to see her if you don't want to.
 Faites le souffrir.
 Are you even up for this? I mean no offense, you're no Emily Bennett. Emily knew what she was doing.
 I don't trust you, I tried to kill you.
 Thank you.
 My mother. She's dead.
 Oh wait! Hide your cast, it's not era-appropriate!
 What eye thing?
 "I have so many emotions, but I don't have any way to express them. Being a teenager is so hard!"
 What my brother is trying to say is, don't blame Elena for this. Damon turned Vicki, I killed her. She was a threat to you, and she was a threat to your sister. I'm sorry that it happened, I wish that it hadn't.
 Stay close.
 I got one.
 You can head up; I'll take it from here.
 What do you think, someone stole it?
 You want me to pick you up?
 Hello?
 She did.
 You're gonna need a drink.
 I mean, it's nothing special, it's pretty much amateur hour over here.
 He's not gonna tell us anything. Kill them both.
 Everything OK?
 With Damon and Bonnie. Fill you in later.
 Damon and Bonnie? Fill me in now.
 She's in denial.
 The authorities believe last night's assailant may also be related to the missing campers and park ranger who have yet to be found, as well as 25-year-old Jessica Cohen, reported missing this morning. The sheriff's department says investigations are pending and no further comment will be made. In related news Mayor Lockwood spoke earlier today...
 Due to the recent tragedies that have plagued our town, we will be holding a memorial in Town Square today to honor all those we have lost. Join us and hope that as a community we can begin to heal.
 We just need answers. Please don't do anything stupid.
 She's good!
 You're going to have to get her out of here before Jenna gets home.
 You've reached Matt. Leave a message.

 Hey you!
 My parents had just started a family, when a plague struck their homeland. They lost a child to it. They wanted to escape and protect their future family from the same fate.
 Drink up brother!
 You get us a bottle of this?
 Blood! What happened? 
 We had to drink more blood to complete the ritual.
 Drink! 
 It was euphoric! The feeling of power was indescribable...but the witch Ayana was right about the consequences. The spirits turned on us, and nature fought back...For every strength there would be a weakness...
 Hey, hey ease up! Ease up. 
 And so had I, but Sage, she reminded me. It's worth it, it's all worth it.
 I don't feel like myself. I'm losing time. As though I'm going mad.

 Caroline...
 
 "By the way, Mom, I'm not a witch anymore, because I died and then came back from the Other Side."
 Nothing.
 Wait? Registering for classes?
 I know. I  She's  I know I have Elena's blessing. I still don't need to rub it in her face the first day in the triple dorm room.
 This hair, by the way, kind of hot.
 Hey! Aaron, hey!
 Who's Aaron?
 Party in a dorm. No, thanks.
 How do you know that about me?
 Because you told me at the costume ball 
 So apparently, we've been invited to a college party. 
 How about my favorite reading chair?
 Just tell Elena thanks, but I'm not really up for a party tonight. 
 What are you watching, some Czech reality show?
 How'd you know it was Czech?
 I...uh...handed out all of the flyers. Oh, and Damon said he was going to try to bring Stefan.
 Hmm. Maybe a call from a mysteriously hot biology TA will help?
 Well look who rose from the dead.
 Oh, my God!
 Who the hell turned you into a vampire?
 How's he doing?
 You want to teach him about compulsion? 
 Well, if you did want to talk to someone, I'm right here. And, uhh, let's be honest, I'm wasted, so I'm not going to remember.
 I am.
 Rabies. Sounds fun, doesn't it? And appropriate, given the circumstances.
 And that's the state of the world from your hometown news station on June 11, 1953. Goodnight Mystic Falls.
 No.
 Matt! Matt, we're coming for you.
 Not exactly the Ritz...
 Yes, Mia. Are you ready to make a deal?
 Our rings...they are messing with them. We can't go outside.
 I don't want them. They make me weak and when I'm weak, he can get inside my head.
 Still looking for Matt? Any word from Elena?
 That'll make her shut up for a while.
 What is it now?
 What the hell was that?
 This isn't awkward.
 Stefan...
 Should we knock his head off?
 Just go away. Don't you think that you've made your point?
 Jenna?
 You're here.
 Come on. Let's get on with this.
 Repeat this spell so I know you understand how the passenger works.
 Can I have a moment with my daughter please?
 So you came all the way to Mystic Falls to back off when I tell you to?
 Hey.
 These drugs are hardcore.
 So this is the memory you came back to? A little dark, no?
 Goodbye, Katherine.
 Is she...
 Not yet. With these drugs...she won't wake up again.
 In the woods...I got lost.
 So...this anchor thing...Does that mean you'll be able to, like...feel Katherine's death...or whatever?
 Because it's depressing as hell.
 Hi...
 Where am I?
 Vyjdi.
 Ouch!
 No to the dress, yes to the shoes.
 Okay. When's Jeremy's birthday?
 Look at you! Captain responsible!
 Aye, Aye Captain.
 I need a favor. You know how Damon was trying to be all noble and broke up with Elena?
 Of course! There was champagne.
 I just mean... are you sure this is really what you want? You know.. Elena and Damon.. or Damon and Elena.. I know there's a nickname in there somewhere.
 He's not out there killing people, which I guess is a plus for mankind.
 Where am I?
 WHERE IS ELENA GILBERT?
 Vyjdi (which translates to; "come forth.")
 Yeah. I'm completely miserable.
 Seriously. I've never met a group of needier people. If it's not bad enough that Damon's trying to win me back, I'm also getting....
 "Where are you?" "I'm worried about you." "Call me." "Are you going to Tyler's party?"
 It's a wonder this thing still has a battery.
 You know you still own my house.
 Elena, hey.
 CONFESSIONS AMONG FRIENDS
 What's in the bag?
 You've gotta be kidding me.
 Matt!
 Elena, hey, come in.
 Thank you. Well that wasn't awkward at all...
 Really bad timing, Blondie. I'm dealing with a blast from the past.
 There you are! I've been calling and texting.
 SAY THE SPELL.
 Took you long enough.
 I was pretending to care. It was very time consuming.
 So, what's happening now?
 Are you okay?
 I know, I know. I'm so sorry.
 No.
 We were just....
 You're drunk.
 Get your hands off me.

 Let me finish. Just a few more seconds and then I'm done.
 GOODBYE ELENA GILBERT
 Are you okay?
 Maza dora el
 At least I fooled one of you.
 No. NO!
 Damon.. thank god.
 No. No. It's my turn now.
 REALIZATIONS
 Hey! I am vulnerable. Don't be mean!
 Shut up.
 Hey. You alright?
 Ahh! It just makes me so happy I'm not 19 and stupid. All right, Bonnie. Where's your little witch friend?
 Liv Parker. She's in one of my classes and she's not my friend. I looked her up, found out she works events catering. This is a total shot in the dark.
 Why all the dramatics, brother?
 Hypothetical Question  If Jeremy Gilbert's life was hanging by a thread, could I credibly just let him die? Because his death would be really convenient for me.
 Does Caroline have feelings for Stefan?
 You okay?
 I just can't lose Jeremy again. Stefan please, help me save him.
 I can't do this.
 You know, you're right. She'll think I'm just some cliche murderer. I really like to make a good impression, you know?
 This is Jeremy.
 Jeremy!
 Eww.
 You should've left when I told you to.
 Come on!
 Ugh. Thank God.
 You missed all the fun.
 And you are?
 What is this? Agh! More witches?
 You okay?
 Yeah. There it is. Try not to move.
 Damon killed Aaron, didn't he? You walked right through the threshold at the Whitmore house. You couldn't have done that if the owner hadn't been dead. Aaron was the owner.
 Hey.
 You think they fell in love milking cows?
 What did you do? What's happening?
 Yes! I will take that as a win for me, not for you.
 It's Tyler. I haven't really spoken to him since the, um, incident.
 Hey.
 No. That's not why I called..
 It'll be fine.. We both have weird ex-friend situations.
 What's going on with Matt?

 Hey, can you hold this for a second?

 Oh my god, Damon?
 Do Not. Come. Here.
 You say something?
 If you were aiming for my heart, you missed!

 Hey uh will you grab me my shirt? It's, uh, the green one right on top
 Wait, wait, wait. This is, uh, wrong. I mean, uh, You and Damon just split up.
 Who do you think Stefan loves more  Damon, or Elena?

 So, you compelled him again.

 Well, the only thing that Matt remembers is that they slept together.
 So..
 This makes no sense. She saved my life. She gave me CPR when Enzo tried to kill me. Katherine would never do that.
 That's what makes it a surprise!
 I can't.
 "Elena", you are so popular today.
 Hey Bonnie!
 And you. I'm not worried about you offing me. Because we both know I made you better by making you a vampire.
 Bon Bon, no need  for goodbyes. I'll see you on the flip side.
 You can always run, Katherine. It's your choice.
 I've said it before and I say it again.
 But that's not really much of a choice, is it? After all Nadia was the only person in this world who really loved me. And I wasn't about to let my daughter die alone.
 I left Elena with a bit of a parting gift.
 No! Noooooooooo!!!!
 To friends!
 Hello?
 Hey. You're awake.
 We had to seal you into the building.. We've got a lot of catching up to do.
 Damon's phone!
 Jer?
 Hey, uh. I'm calling you on a payphone.
 Oh my god.
 Elena!

 Bad news... It's not the same virus.
 Hey. Aaron, it's Elena. I, um, ahem, I hope that you're off on some private island somewhere, enjoying your spring break. Look, a lot has happened. And I'd really like to talk about it, if you're still willing to talk to me.. So call me back, okay? Alright. Bye.
 Oh well. I didn't like this shirt anyway.

 The highlight of my day I'll check on you later, okay?

 That's for you, sit.
 Where are the antidotes?
 Wait! You said you weren't going to hurt him.
 Elena.. What are you doing?
 You're going to be okay. Stay still.

00 pm, for a parent/teacher conference at Jeremy's school. After sitting there for a few minutes, she looks over at Damon, who is sleeping, and tries to sneak out of the bed)
 Atlanta assassination squad. How may we be of service?
 She did the vision thing again?
 We had a deal. I find Stefan's last living doppelgänger
 Tom
 Tom. I-I take care of Tom and in return, you stop using Stefan to psychically doppel-bomb him. Because every time you link the two, you are frying Stefan's brain.
 I'll kill you too? You're like a perky, blonde angel of death. Almost had me convinced.
 Bottle of Gin and let me see you break the seal.
 Hey Bon.
 Uh. That's because I slept with him.
 Damon Salvatore. Present.

 We moved. Why?
 I hope you're calling me to tell me the doppelgänger is dead.
 Stefan?! Stefan! Are you still with me?
 Okay
 Cheating? That is so not like him. Go on, please.
 Calm down. You can trust me.
 I'm your friend and you mean the world to me. Do you trust me?
 Hey, Jer.
 You're missing an incredibly boring presentation.

 Oh god.
 Are you freaking kidding me?
 Oh god.


 Hey Jer, um, I haven't heard back and I have a million questions, so... I miss you, and... I'm confused, that's all. Call me?
 What's up, Blondie?
 I think he's trying to say something.
 Yo-o-u hav-ve enou-gh blo-ood.
 Shhh. Get out of here. GO!
 Bonnie!!
 It was funnier the first time.
 Damon is in full-hero mode today.
 What are you doing?

 Maybe Caroline's nearby?
 Not what I was expecting...

 Nothing.
 Salvatore Boring House.

 Oh my god!
 I'm sorry. I really am. We need to make the doppelgänger blood useless. One of you needs to die.
 A traveler just died.
 Ahhh. Here's something you don't see every day.
 I think I won this in a poker game. Or, maybe Stefan brought it back from he war. I don't remember.


 Oh my god! Oh my god.
 What the hell happened? Marie was the only one who was willing to help us who knew the spell.
 Help me Please! Oh my god! Oh my god! Somebody help! Somebody help!


 Az vezat esvat.
 Go with your first instinct Damon, lesson learned

 She's ready. Let's get on with it.
 Help me.
59 pm.)
 You can do this, Liv.
 I know what you're about to say.

 No!
 Come on!
 Yeah?
 I'm right here.
 Good to see you too, buddy.
 You need to come through.
 This isn't happening.
 Not just yet!
 Bonnie!

 You lied to me.
 I lied. There was never any way for me to stop being the anchor. When the other side goes, I go with it.
 I love you
 A couple thousand, at most.

 What was that?
 Okay...
 Hey.. I got the lantern...
 Oh my God! Sheriff Forbes... I thought you were a serial killer.
 Jessie! No No No. It's going to be okay. I'll get help!
 Today was a good day. Summer is officially over and I couldn't be more thrilled.
 Sophomore year... I guess this is the year to pick a major and start carving out your path in life. So that's what I did (lighting several candles). You're looking at the future Doctor Elena Gilbert.
 Ok.. so maybe I spent the day observing, but at least now we have unlimited access to blood bags. And trust me, we need all the help we can get.
 In Alaric's defense, he couldn't exactly compel himself a job back at the high school. Nope.. the high school; the grill; the town square.. thanks to the traveler's anti magic spell, everything in Mystic Falls was still off-limits to anyone with fangs. A lot of us haven't been back home in months. On the plus side, the crime rate is way down.
 Although I'm not sure Matt got the memo.
 I will say he's never been better. I think he can bench press more than Jeremy now, which is beyond freaky.
 Speaking of Jeremy.. actually, let's not talk about my brother. Let's talk about Stefan.
 Last I heard, he was chasing some lead to some witch that can contact the dead.
 We haven't spoken in months, which can only mean his search for answers to what happened has been all-consuming.
 He's grieving.. He lost so much.. We all did, but we're all getting through it in our own way.
 I dropped out of Whitmore. Why would I support their stupid football team?
 Anyway.. as I was saying, I haven't exactly found a spell that can undo an anti-magic border per se, but this book mentions travelers. Which isn't all that helpful, but at least it puts us a step in the right direction..
 She  doesn't want to let go. I don't blame her.. I don't want to let go either. I don't want to think that everything has changed and that I have to start over... the worst thing that could possibly happen actually did.

 Occult  the word in its literal translation means hidden.


 It's Stefan. Leave a message.
 It's been four months, it's time for me to let go.
 He kissed me. I mean, I shouldn't have let him. I knew that he was in love with me, and even though Stefan and I were on the outs, I shouldn't have let him.
 If you were still a witch. Which with our luck, and your skill probably ain't the case.
 You're ridiculous.
 It says, May 10th, 1994. It's the same day as yesterday.
 Don't know, I'm not her keeper.
 I'm going for a jog.
 He bailed on me.
 Damon stepped in. )
 He saved me from being embarrassed, in front of everyone.
 He took my arm, and led me out with the rest of the girls and all their dates and we danced. I remember that was the first time, I felt it.
 You went down the stairs and no one was there.
 Okay, your feelings were because of the sire bond, who is Damon Salvatore?
 No one kissed anyone, who is Damon Salvatore?
 Did you hear that?
 About a month or so ago.
 Yeah, because she doesn't want to admit what everyone already knows.
 Well, let me summarize them for you. You're a dick, if you want him out of your house, you'll throw him out yourself.
 No, I was completely faithful to Stefan.
 It's okay to love them both. How sad is it that my own evil doppelgänger was smarter than me?
 Damon and I spent the entire summer looking for Stefan.
 And I was trying to put on a good face because Caroline was throwing this party for me but I was just so sad.
 I was two seconds from deciding that I wasn't going to go, I wasn't going to leave the room.
 Until Damon walked in to give me my...birthday gift.
 And Damon knew what the necklace meant to me.
 He gave me the one thing that represented hope for me and his brother. I knew how much it hurt him. But he did it.
 It was...the most selfless that he's ever been, and in that moment...I loved him. I didn't want to, I mean, I It terrified me but, for that moment I loved him.
 It's okay, I'm ready.
 Put on some party clothes and come to Whitmore. Tyler's coming over and we are going out.
 You sound good.
 Yeah, well I'm going to go throw this out. (He heads into the backyard, and when he returns into the house Enzo has Ivy by her neck with both his hands.)
 It doesn't matter how he knows it, he's right. I stole it from my old boss, he had wandering hands to I wandered my hands to his car keys.
 Look Jeremy's a good kid, he's just going through some stuff.
 Ain't a parking lot, kid.
 Ain't a parking lot, kid.
 Come with me.  Like I said, I need a few days off.
 Tell that to Stefan, who clearly needs no one.
 Cut him some slack, he lost his brother. Granted, said brother was a homicidal maniac. But, still.
 Okay, fine I'll go to the party.
 I hate bourbon, but I love this house. Can I just pretend that I found my dad and it's whoever lives here?

 I didn't. Fill. It. In.
 I'm saying it makes more sense than the alternative. (He snatches the eggs and slams them in the cart, Bonnie takes off her glasses.)

 I checked every room. Sarah is gone. And it looks like she trashed place.

 Stefan Cooper, what are you doing?
 Did you leave the door open?
 Zach.
 Dear me, if you're reading this, then somebody spilled the beans about your selective memory loss. My money is on Caroline. Yes, you loved Damon. You loved him with a passion that consumed you. And then, when Damon died, the void he filled was too deep, too dark. Facing an eternity without your soulmate, you went off the deep end. You turned into someone that you weren't  a monster. Alaric can restore your lost memories—all you have to do is ask. But, I hope that you don't. I tried it the other way, and I didn't see an end to the pain. I want you to rediscover yourself in the absence of who defined you. If you feel any hope for the future at all, then you're already better off. You've been given a chance to start over. I want you to take it. I want you to be happy.
 SAVANNAH
 WHITMORE
45)
 Well, I am officially in hell. This place is my own personal hell.
 Actually, it can't. Don't worry. I'm not sending you back to Duke. I brought Duke to you.
 Liz, it's Miranda Gilbert. I have something urgent to talk to you about. Please call me back as soon as you can.
 I want to run something by you. Is there any chance you can get to the sheriff's office?
 Are you stoned?
 Ahh, ok. Well, you need so eye drops, a squirt of perfume, and half a pizza. This is important.
 Oh, this will come as a shock to you, but I don't care. There's a tunnel along the river off route 13. It's dark, private. I want you to bring our photographer friend there.
 I'm here. You don't see me?
28.)
 One of these students showed me something called WebMD. Apparently, I have a form of retrograde amnesia. So far, I've cancelled out encephalitis and paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. Most of my characteristics fall under fugue-state Amnesia, which is rare, but then again, so is coming back from the dead...
 Which I just said way too loudly.
 What?
 Laura! My star pupil.
 
 What the hell is wrong with me?
 
 
 A woman was wielding a sword that pierced my heart. The blade was metal... It shouldn't have been able to kill me, but it did.
 
15.
 No, no, no, no! Kindly lay your gun down.
 If you turn around and go right now, you will find none. All we want is is to go home.
 Unh!
 Okay, okay...
 She's only a bird in a gilded cage, A beautiful sight to see...
 She's not, though she seems to be...
 We can bring him back. We've done it before.
 No. Nothing.
 I'm sorry, do I know you?
 What is this?
 "Day 57 of being pissed off at my garbage-heap of a brother..."
 
 
 So did I. And a girlfriend and a life. And now I don't.
 Virginia forced Lucy Bennett to seal a vault in the Armory with magic.
 I need to know if the effects of those pills can be reversed.
 Dalton...
 What's in there?
 It strips away your compassion.
 It takes away your empathy, your capacity for love...
 The pills are out of my system. Which means the Armory's not far behind.
 Go away.
 You haven't even given me a chance to ask.
 Yeah. Everybody's sorry.
 We don't know that they don't know that.
 Then we do it again.
 I don't know how many 24 hours you have left.
 Alexandria?
 I'm so alone.
 I'll get you out soon. I promise.
 Killing spree?
 Put her on.
 Hey.
 What, and poisoning yourself is a better option? You just shortened the already miniscule window of time we have. We're so close.
 What?
 I'll admit, I was surprised to see you on my phone sheet. Is there something I can do for you, Damon?
 I'm listening.
 That there was at least one vampire in Mystic Falls the night Penny died.
 It was you.
 Help me!
 Poor form, Ashlynn! Shoot! Thanks.
 When have I not?
 You know, it worked for Beauty and the Beast.
 They're killing them.
 Just when I thought you were worthy of forgiveness, you do this.
 Whatever is in that vault makes people into monsters, and I'm not gonna be responsible for letting it out!
 Put her on.
 Lapis De bello. Hmm, this was given to Charlemagne by his first wife.
 Yeah, that explains why he got a second wife.
 No, legend has it this allowed him to conquer half of Western Europe. You know, I spent three years searching for this thing. Through every tomb, every monastery throughout Europe, I couldn't find it. I gave up. I convinced myself it didn't exist. There it is.
 Yeah, well, good thing we got kidnapped, 'cause now it gives you a little bit of closure. Sorry, it's... you were right. Both of us shouldn't have come.
 Tell me that everything's gonna be fine.
 How am I supposed to trust you? You were the last person to see Penny alive.
 Depends on where those blood bags in your trunk came from.
 Remember.
 No.
 No. Oh, God.
 It was my fault.
 Be ready for anything.
 Alexandria.
 What have you done to my sister?!
 Run!
 Bonnie, please!?
 For Caroline. Yeah, I know. But it sounds like she didn't want that, so why don't you just stay away from her too? You ruined my life, Stefan. And you ruined Penny's life too. Whose life are you gonna ruin next?
 Oh, things are finished. He finished them when he just Ashlynn'd his way out of town three years ago. And did you see how she just bailed on Wyatt like that? He was her partner, and then the minute things got a little bit messy, she just ran away. I mean, do you see anything about a disaster of a love affair like that that needs finishing?
 No, I do! I need closure. I don't know if you remember, but my last wedding didn't go so well. So if you think that there's a chance that you and Stefan, uh, might find your way back together again, I'd like to know before I pick out my tie. No, because I want to marry you, and I want to be your loyal, honest, committed partner. And I want our little family to work. But I don't want it if you'd rather be with someone else.
 Wait, what? What does that mean?
 Do you think I could ever forgive you for the things you did to me? Now neither will Bonnie. When she wakes, she'll be just like me, full of hatred for you and your kind and unable to rest until you've been wiped from this earth.
 Damon...
 Damon...
 Damon, help me.
 Please...
 Please, help me. I'm so alone. I need you.
 Right here!
 Completely cleaned out. I don't know how they got out, but they did.
 I'm worried about Bonnie. She lost the two people closest to her, and she can't even do a locator spell to find them. Her magic never came back. She feels hopeless.
 I reached out to all my contacts, knowing they'd show up sooner or later. I owed 'em that much. Then I left. Because as sad as it is, this isn't my fight. And if I'm ever going to be happy, I have to recognize which ones are.
 It was three months before we heard the first rumor... a string of missing persons on the West Coast. It was encouraging. But then the numbers kept growing. 20, 50, 60 people missing.
 It's them. I know it. I don't know what's wrong with them, or what they're doing, or why... but I promise you, we'll get him back. Just know that whatever happens between now and then... it's not his fault.
 When Damon and Enzo start tearing each other apart, do you really think Stefan is gonna let Enzo kill his brother? No. He's gonna choose Damon.
 The fate of psychics was exile. Which is how our poor, innocent, forsaken village girl ended up on a raft... The current carrying her into the rocks of a cold and distant shore. But abandoned though she was meant to be, alone she was not. There she met the girl of the island. Exiled together, connected in psychic ability, two sisters in everything but blood, destined from that moment to one day become... the sirens. So you see, Stefan, I understand why you would do anything for your brother. Because my sister will do anything for me.
 Oh... help... somebody help...
 Who are you?
 Arcadius?
You are supposed to be dead.
 My sister. Can you help her?
 Anything.
 I'm not leaving you.
 Then do us all a favor. And drop dead.
 Why don't you tell us about what brought you to the meeting today?
 You are supposed to be on Stefan duty.
 Enzo? Enzo? What...
 I said yes, okay? We'll do it. We'll rescue everyone but ourselves, again!
 Uh-uh-uh... You have to notarize that page. Where's your stamp? 
 Yeah, well, tell that to the corpses you just compelled everyone to forget.
 Now, unless you're in a hovercraft, you're not gonna catch me in time.
 The bell rang 11 times. Enough for me to pay a visit.
 Hi, this is Stefan. Leave your number.
