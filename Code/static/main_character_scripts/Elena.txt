 Dear diary, today will be different. It has to be. I will smile, and it will be believable. My smile will say "I'm fine, thank you." "Yes, I feel much better." I will no longer be the sad little girl who lost her parents. I will start fresh, be someone new. It's the only way I'll make it through.
 It's all about the coffee, Aunt Jenna.
 I'm good.
 Don't you have a big presentation today?
 Then go. We'll be fine. You okay?
 I did it again, didn't I? I I'm sorry, Bonnie. You were telling me that...
 Right. Okay, then predict something. About me.
 It's okay. I'm fine.
 Really, I can't be freaked out by cars for the rest of my life.
 No, that's over.
 He hates me.
 Caroline, I'm right here. And I'm fine. Thank you.
 Yes. Much better.
 Okay, Caroline.
 No comment.
 All I see is back.
 You're really going to run this whole psychic thing into the ground, huh?
 I'll be right back.
 Great. It's the first day of school and you're stoned.
 Where is it? Is it on you?
 Chill myself? What is that, stoner talk? Dude, you are so cool.
 You haven't seen crazy, Jeremy! I gave you a summer pass, but I am done watching you destroy yourself. No, no, no, you know what? Go ahead. Keep it up. But just know that I am going to be there to ruin your buzz every time, you got it? Jeremy, I know who you are. And it's not this person. So don't be this person.
 Yes. Um, I was just, Um—I was just—It's a long story....
 Thank you.
 Dear diary, I made it through the day. I must have said, "I'm fine, thanks," at least thirty-seven times. And I didn't mean it once. But no one noticed. When someone asks, "How are you?" They really don't want an answer.
 Okay. Hi, bird. That's not creepy or anything. Shoo!
 That's what I thought.
 Ahh!
 Were you following me?
 Uh-huh, and you just happened to be hanging out in a cemetery.
 Oh. Wow. Tactless. I'm sorry. It's the fog, It's making me foggy. And then back there, there was this - this bird, and it was all very Hitchcock for a second. That is the bird movie, right, the Hitchcock?...I'm Elena.
 I know. We have History together.
 Right.
 Thanks...Nice ring.
 No, no. It's just, I mean, there are rings and then there's that.
 Hmm?
 Oh, uh, I don't know.
 Oh! Would you look at that. That is not pretty.
 Are you okay?
 Really, it's nothing.
 I'm meeting Bonnie at the grill.
 Well done, Aunt Jenna.
 Oh.
 No worries. I get it, blood makes you squeamish.
 Oh, it's fine. Just a scratch, barely. How did you know where I lived?
 Oh, I must have dropped it. I thank you.
 No? Why not? Most people would have.
 You keep a journal?
 Yeah. I'm just gonna...umm, you don't have to stay out there.
 Yeah, I'm meeting a friend. Do you want to come?
 Hey.
 I'm sorry. Any siblings?
 I'm sorry, I I don't know.
 Oh, okay, so he's a little pretty.
 I don't know. You tell me, you're the psychic one.
 Wait, you need a crystal ball.
 What?
 What?
 Okay? Bonnie!
 Hi.
 Yeah.
 Oh, uh, no, it's- it's just Bonnie. She's...You know what? Never mind. You're...here.
 You know, you're kind of the talk of the town.
 Mmm hmm. Mysterious new guy, oh, yeah.
 What makes you think that I'm sad?
 Right. Well, no, technically we met in the men's room. You don't want to know, it's....it's not exactly party chit-chat.
 Last spring. . my parents' car drove off of a bridge into the lake. And I was in the backseat and I survived, but...they didn't. So that's my story.
 Best friend in the world.
 Matt's that friend since childhood that you start dating because you owe it to yourselves to see if you can be more.
 And then my parents died, and everything changes. Anyway, Matt and I, together we just, I don't know, it wasn't, um...it wasn't...
 No. No, it wasn't passionate...
 Hey, um, are you okay? Um, Your eye, it just, it's 
 Hey.
 Matt, you don't understand. It's 
 Matt...
 I was wondering who abducted you, but now I know.
 No. You're fresh meat. She'll back off eventually. Hmm. God, you gotta be kidding me!
 My brother.
 That would be the one. Excuse me.
 Trust me, you're not going to want to witness this. Jeremy! Jeremy!
 Jeremy, where the hell are you going?
 Yeah, well, too bad!
 Oh, my god!
 Somebody help!
 It's her neck. Something bit her. She's losing a lot of blood.
 I gotta take Jeremy home.
 Bonnie, what?
 You okay? I called Jenna, she's on her way. Those people in uniforms, last time I checked, they're the police. People are going to stop giving you breaks, Jer. They just don't care anymore. They don't remember that our parents are dead, because they've got their own lives to deal with. The rest of the world has moved on. You should try, too.
 Mom and Dad wouldn't have wanted this.
 Dear diary, I couldn't have been more wrong. I thought that I could smile, nod my way through it; pretend like it would all be ok.
 Without the pain.
 But it's not that easy. The bad things stay with you.
 All you can do is be ready for the good. So when it comes, you invite it in, because you need it. I need it.
 You know, for months, that's all anyone's wondered about me. If I'll be ok.
 That I'll be fine.
 Ask me tomorrow. It's warmer in the house. We can talk. Would you like to come in?
 Dear diary, this morning is...different. There is change. I can sense it, feel it.
 For once, I don't regret the day before it begins.
 Because I know...
 I will see him again. For the first time in a long time, I feel good.
 Depends on where you're going.
 Sexy stewardess.
 Boozy housewife.
 I feel good, which is rare. So I've decided to go with it. Fly free, walk on the sunshine, and all that stuff. Where is Jeremy?
 No.
 "Wuthering Heights" by Ellis Bell. You know, I can't believe she didn't use her real name.
 Where did you get it?
 Ah.
 Oh, no. I...but I would like to read it again. I promise I'll give it back.
 That's good news.
 Did you get in touch with your mom?
 Vicki's lucky that she's ok.
 Did she say what kind of animal it was that attacked her?
 What?
 OK, that is weird.
 Matt, the last thing that I want to do is hurt you.
 So then nothing.
 Nope. We didn't go there.
 We just talked for hours.
 Profound.
 Caroline's right. It is easy. If I sit here long enough, I'll end up talking myself out of it instead of doing what I started the day saying what I was going to do.
 Stefan? Stefan?
 I...I'm sorry for barging in. The door was...open.
 He didn't tell me he had a brother.
 Wow. This is your living room?
 The last one?
 Nope.
 You say it like every relationship is doomed to end.
 I know. I should have called, I just...
 Yeah, I should probably go. It was nice to meet you, Damon.
 Stefan....Stefan?
 He's on the rebound and has raging family issues.
 Or text. But I realized we never even exchanged that stuff. We've never gotten to the texting part.
 Isn't it? The timing is wrong, anyway.
 I'm not ready, Bonnie.
 At least I put myself out there.
 What do you mean?
 Hi. Hey.
 Thank you.
 Hi.
 Yeah, Bonnie says it's a harbinger of evil.
 You seem to spend a lot of time apologizing.
 You didn't tell me that you had a brother.
 Always. He told me about your ex. Katherine.
 That she broke your heart.
 When you lose someone, it stays with you, always reminding you of how easy it is to get hurt.
 It's OK, Stefan. I get it. You have no idea how much I get it. Complicated brother? Check. Complicated ex? Check. Too complicated to even contemplate dating, double check. It's OK. We met, and we talked, and it was epic, but...then the sun came up and reality set in. So...
 What's with the pill pusher?
 Are you dealing?
 Oh, no, no, no. You are coming with me. So that's your game now, dealing?
 Look, I'm sick of the tough love speech, Jer. It's clearly having no impact.
 We can stop if you want. Send you to a therapist where you'll be forced to deal with it or to rehab where you'll sit in group and tell some stranger how you let your life fall apart. Or you could talk to me.
 Jer?
 What are you doing?
 What brought this on?
 You got tannered. Been there.
 You're not screwing up, Aunt Jenna.
 This is just the fear talking. You're a little scared, that's all. We all are. I have to go do something. But are you going to be ok?
 Hey.
 The comet's actually this way.
 Sorry for barging in. Especially after earlier.
 See, the thing is, I got home tonight planning on doing what I always do, write in my diary, like I have been since my mom gave me one when I was 10. It's where I get everything out, everything I'm feeling. It all goes in this little book that I hide on the second shelf behind this really hideous ceramic mermaid. But then I realized that I'd just be writing things that I should probably be telling you.
 I would write..."Dear diary, today I convinced myself it was ok to give up. Don't take risks. Stick with the status quo. No drama, now is just not the time. But my reasons aren't reasons, they're excuses. All I'm doing is hiding from the truth, and the truth is that..." I'm scared, Stefan. I'm scared that if I let myself be happy for even one moment that...the world's just going to come crashing down, and I...don't know if I can survive that.
 You were the one who said to go for it.
 Why the about-face?
 Oh, because I'm so that girl. Seriously, what are you not saying?
 Bonnie...
 Spit it out.
 Is that it? Bonnie.
 Is this the whole witch mojo thing again?
 And I love you for it, I do. But I feel good. It's been a hard year, and I'm starting to kind of feel like things are getting back to normal again. And you know what? Stefan is a big part of that.
 Bonnie, wait...
 She doesn't know you. She's my best friend. She's just looking out for me. But when she does, she will love you.
 Here's what we're going to do. Are you free tonight?
 Perfect. Dinner, my house. 8 00. You, me, and Bonnie. You two will spend some quality time and she'll get to see what a great guy you are. Mission accomplished.
 That throw was insane. I didn't know you played football.
 So why don't you try out for the team?
 So you don't like football?
 They don't know you. To them, you're mysterious loner guy. Wouldn't hurt to be part of. Make some friends.
 Hey, come on. There's more to me than just gloomy graveyard girl. There's a whole other Elena that you have yet to meet. She was into everything, very busy.
 Soon. She's working on it.
 Psst. FYI...Our team sucks. They could use you.
 Hmm?
 Um...
 How did you know all of that?
 Yep. I can't be sad girl forever. The only way to get things back to the way they were are to do things that were. Oh, and you're coming to dinner tonight.
 Mm-hmm. You, me and Stefan. You have to give him a chance.
 Don't change the subject, Bonnie Bennett! You're going to be there.
 Good.
 I don't know. It's not like her.
 Uh...
 That's not a mystery guy. That's Damon Salvatore.
 Oh, come on. That commercial's on a constant loop.
 Maybe we should play the lottery. Have you talked to your Grams?
 I don't want to be a witch.
 Ok, serving spoons. Where are the serving spoons?
 Ok, so you've been in this kitchen like a thousand times.
 Ok, he's here. Don't be nervous. Just be your normal loving self.
 Did Tanner give you a hard time today?
 Bonnie, you should have seen Stefan today. Tyler threw a ball right at him, and...
 Why don't you tell Stefan about your family?
 No, about the witches. Bonnie's family has a lineage of witches. It's really cool.
 I wonder who that could be.
 Oh.
 Oh, yeah, you can...
 It's fine. Just come on in.
 Thank you.
 Oh, thank you.
 Nice save.
 Earlier, did you mean...Katherine?
 How did she die?
 Recently?
 What was she like?
 So which one of you dated her first?
 Why do you say that?
 You saw that?
 I used to love it. It was fun. Things are different this year. Everything that used to matter doesn't anymore.
 Some things could matter again.
 I'm sorry. About Katherine. You lost her, too.
 Tonight wasn't so bad. I had fun.
 Come on. Your brother isn't as bad as you make him out to be...
 Ooh. Look at you. You look hot in your jersey.
 I quit. I'm a quitter.
 Oh, my God, it's beautiful.
 Is that rose that I smell?
 I love it.
 We're a pair. I quit, you start.
 Jeremy, no!
 What the hell, Jeremy? Put your head up, you're bleeding.
 Yeah, you smell fine.
 Oh, my God, your hand.
 Is it deep? How bad is it? Come on!
 But...I saw it, it was...
 No, no, no. I...I saw it. The glass cut your hand. It was...
 Can I ask you a question and you give me a really serious no-joke response?
 The bad mojo. When you touched Stefan and you had that reaction...
 No, Bonnie, seriously. What was it? Did you see something, Or...
 Yeah?
 And what?
 You scared me. What are you doing here?
 And why is that?
 That could be a sign.
 Not much younger than you are.
 Caroline does have some really annoying traits, but we've been friends since the first grade and that means something to me.
 Yes, it is. Otherwise you wouldn't put an alternate meaning behind everything you say.
 Really?
 Excuse me?
 What the hell? I don't know what game you're trying to play with Stefan here, but I don't want to be part of it. And I don't know what happened in the past, but let's get one thing straight...I am not Katherine.
 What kind of animal could be doing all this? Why would it come out of the woods and attack someone in the middle of town?
 I was so sure that you cut your hand. I saw it.
 Hello? Jeremy? Hello?
 Who are you talking to?
 The news guy?
 Oh, no way. You and him? He's cute.
 I went yesterday and got it from the safe deposit box. Mom had told Mrs. Lockwood she would loan it to the founder's council for their heritage display.
 Originally it was great-great-grandma Mary's wedding ring.
 You're not gonna find out.
 I'm not giving it away. It's called a loan, Jeremy.
 Hi.
 Are you okay?
 Maybe we should press pause.
 Yeah.
 How do you look in a suit?
 How about tomorrow night? Will you be my date to the Founder's Party?
 Have you been before?
 Well, this year, there's this heritage project that meant a lot to my mom. She was really involved in the founder's council, and it was her favorite party. I know it sounds really boring, but—
 The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Salvatore.
 Right here. Please be careful.
 Hey! Not now, okay, guys? Please?
 Look, Tyler, maybe you should go. Tell your mom that I'll see her tonight.
 Tough call. Can we mix them?
 I am...ish. Tonight's going to be a good night. But don't let that stop you from telling me whatever it is you wanted to tell me as soon as you walked in the door.
 Bonnie, out with it.
 Uh-huh.
 I know that they both dated her and that's why they have issues.
 That sounds like one person's side of the story, meaning Damon's.
 Anyway, his past relationships are none of my business.
 Stefan is none of those things.
 Hello? Hi, Mrs. Lockwood. What do you mean? It is? Are you sure? 'Cause I saw it. Let me check. Mm-hmm. I will find it and bring it. Ok. Bye.
 The pocket watch. Where is it?
 The one you stole from mom's box. Look, Mrs. Lockwood just called me, freaking out. It was on the list, Jeremy. And she can't find it, and she thinks she's the one who lost it.
 Don't even play that card. Jeremy, you took it. If I go online, am I going to find it on eBay? Is that how you pay for your pot?
 Then why did you take it?
 And he was going to give it to you.
 Look, Jeremy, it's still yours, okay? Mom promised Mrs. Lockwood. What do you want me to do?
 Hi, Mayor Lockwood
 There's a lot of history here.
 "The founding families in Mystic Falls welcomes you to the inaugural founder's council celebration." Wow, look, it's the original guest registry. Look at all these familiar names—Sheriff William Forbes, Mayor Benjamin Lockwood. Is that Damon Salvatore? And, Stefan Salvatore?
 It's not boring, Stefan. I'd love to hear more about your family.
 Oh, uh...
 It's up to Stefan.
 For what?
 The Battle of Willow Creek.
 I know, we talked about it in class. Confederate soldiers fired on a church with civilians inside.
 Who was in the church that they wanted to save?
 Look, I'm sorry that you and Stefan have this thing between you, but I can't get in the middle of it, Damon. I just...I hope you two can work it out.
 Stefan, do you have another dance in you?
 No, actually, he was on good behavior. He even apologized and explained why he is the way he is. And it all goes back to Katherine.
 So tell me about her. What happened?
 I get that. I do. I just want you to know that you can. I mean, I burden you with all of my drama, and I want you to do the same.
 The truth is, Stefan...I don't really know that much about you, and I'd really love it if you would open up to me.
 This isn't about Damon, it's about me trying to get to know you. Look, you're the mystery guy, and I like that. But with mystery comes secrets, and this thing with Katherine.
 Well, then, say something about yourself. Anything. Otherwise, I'm left with nothing but what other people tell me.
 Well, then I guess it's working.
 It's not your fault. I just—I feel terrible because I said that I wouldn't get in the middle of it, and then that's exactly what I did. I got all snotty.
 Oh, um, I'm sorry, Mrs. Lockwood. I, um, I couldn't find it. I guess it's still packed up in my parents' stuff somewhere.
 OK.
 Hey.
 Great. Just great.
 What is that?
 Oh god, Caroline, what happened?
 That is not nothing! Did somebody hurt you?
 Did Damon hurt you?
 There is something seriously wrong with you. You stay away from Caroline or I will go straight to her mother, the sheriff. You got it? Stay away from her.
 I'm sorry. I take it all back. You're completely right about Damon.
 There are bruises all over Caroline's body. Bite marks, and he has her all confused and messed up in the head. You don't look surprised.
 Handling it? Stefan, you should be having him arrested.
 I don't understand anything, Stefan. So why don't you just clear it up for me?
 Trust is earned. I can't just magically hand it over.
 Caroline? There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you. Are you okay?
 Caroline, what happened?
 No. You're shaking. Caroline—What—
 Caroline, come here, come here.
 It's it's ok. Take your time.
 Jenna! Are you aware of what's going on upstairs?
 And you have no objection?
 Oh, so you're actually going to do it. You're gonna go out with Logan.
 Not since he left that very vague message three days ago. "Hi, um, Elena, I, um, have something I have to do. I'll, uh, explain in a few days."
 Nope. Not going to either.
 No, I'm not ok with any of it. But I'm not gonna cry about it, either. You know, I was going to write in my diary this morning and then I thought, what am I going to write? Honestly, I'm not gonna be one of those pathetic girls whose world stops spinning because of some guy.
 I'll be fine.
 Unbelievable. It's like nothing happened.
 No worries. I'll live.
 And did you...deal with Damon?
 For four days?
 Sure. When?
 Ok.
 This is a good thing, Caroline.
 Hey, Matt, um, have you seen Stefan?
 And there's Vicki, all nonchalant in the bathroom like it's no big deal that they're hooking up.
 Yeah.
 Hitting the hour mark. Nothing's wrong though. Which means I'm not talking boy problems with you.
 Ok. Here goes  What do you think of Stefan? Is he a good guy?
 Not any one thing. He's just so secretive all the time. I think there's something that he doesn't want me to know, which makes me want to know all the more.
 No, of course not. But what do we know about him, really?
 So you think I'm just being paranoid?
 What happened?
 Is everything ok?
 And you couldn't call and tell me that you were going to be an hour late?
 What was unavoidable? Ok.
 No, Stefan, don't you get it? Every question gets a vague non-answer. What is so awful that you're afraid to tell me?
 Wait, what was that?
 Right, nothing. Ok, um...I gotta go, Stefan. Excuse me.
 I tried. I want so much to make things right, but every instinct in my body is telling me to be careful. What you don't know can hurt you.
 Is Vicki in there?
 I'm miserable.
 Jenna? Jenna? Stefan? What are you doing here?
 I don't know what you're trying to accomplish.
 Stefan...
 Here, let me.
 I didn't say anything. Hey, this is for the garlic bread, right? Because I'm not eating garlic unless you agree to, too.
 Ow! Ahh.
 Yeah. Think so.
 Your face...
 Stefan. Hey. Stefan! Um, I think that my paranoia has turned into full-blown hallucinations.
 No we are not.
 Hey!
 And judged, yeah.
 I'm sorry, but I guess you're going to have to take that off.
 Ok.
 Ok, um sorry, So not sexy. Ugh.
 You're getting soap in that.
 I noticed that Damon has one, too. Is there a story behind it?
 Hmm. What's the stone?
 Oh. You should really take it off. I could put it in my bag.
 Ok. I'm gonna get some towels.
 Hey, we're out of towels and those shimmy things.
 That'll be $20. I saw you last night. You were talking to a friend of mine. At the grill?
 Stefan Salvatore.
 Where do you think you'd seen him before?
 Oh.
 The attack?
 His uncle? Zach?
 I'm sorry, sir. I don't think I'm familiar with the story.
 No, he was sweet. Hey, sir, I'm sorry. Um, are you sure that the man that you saw, that you knew, his name was Stefan Salvatore?
 Damon?
 When was this?
 Uh, I don't know where she went. She abandoned me. Hey, I realized earlier, I had no idea that your family was from Italy.
 Right. Duh. Are there any other Salvatores in Mystic Falls?
 Where did everyone else go?
 Hmm.
 I'm just trying to learn more about you.
 Your car was done an hour ago.
 Oh.
 Is he enough in your good graces that i can ask him for a favor?
 Do you have access to old news stories, say, fifties?
 I have this report way past due. It'd be a life saver.
 If anyone asks, you don't know where I went. I don't want Caroline to know that I left.
 An incident from 1953. If it even happened at the old Salvatore boarding house.
 Ok.
 You got it.
 Dear diary, I'm not a believer. People are born, they grow old, and then they die. That's the world we live in. There's no magic, no mysticism, no immortality. There's nothing that defies rational thought.
 People are supposed to be who they say they are. And not lie or hide their true selves.
 It's not possible. I'm not a believer, I can't be. But how can I deny what's right in front of me? Someone who never grows old...
 Never gets hurt...
 Oh, my god, your hand! Is it deep? How bad is it?
 Someone who changes in ways that can't be explained...
 Hey, um, are you ok? Your eye. Your face.
 Girls bitten...
 What is that? Oh, my god, what happened to you?
 Bodies drained of blood...
 Did she say what kind of animal it was?
 What are you?
 What are you? What are you?
 No, I don't.
 It's not possible. It can't be.
 What are you?
 I shouldn't have come.
 No. No. How did you do that?
 Let me go.
 Let me go!
 All those animal attacks, those people who died...
 Damon?
 How can you ask me that?
 Just go. Just go, please. Go. If you mean me no harm, then you'll go!
 You said you would explain everything. That's why I asked you to meet me here. When you Google "vampire" you get a world of fiction. What's the reality?
 I know you eat garlic.
 And somehow, sunlight's not an issue.
 Thank you.
 Crucifixes?
 Holy water?
 Mirrors?
 You said you don't kill to survive.
 And yet you let him get involved with Caroline?
 He was hurting her!
 Is that supposed to make it ok?
 Are there any others, aside from you and Damon?
 Not anymore?
 I can't promise that.
 What are we doing here?
 In the middle of nowhere?
 It looks so...
 Wait. How long have you...
 Oh, my god.
 You knew Katherine in 1864? Damon made it seem like...
 All because you loved the same women 145 years ago?
 The first founder's party...Where you signed the registry.
 So he was upset.
 So he stole her from you, not the other way around?
 Is that Damon's ring?
 No, don't, Stefan. Keep it hidden.
 And how is that?
 The mind control...You said Katherine used. Do you ever do that to me?
 What's going on?
 You know what's wrong with her?
 What is it?
 Transitioning to what?
 What?
 H-how does she do that?
 And what if she doesn't?
 She's upstairs with him right now.
 So when is she gonna know?
 The same choice you made?
 Go.
 He'll call when he finds her.
 We wait. We're supposed to wait.
 She'll be fine. It'll all be fine.
 Jeremy, go upstairs.
 Stay away from me.
 He's out looking for Vicki.
 Did you thank Katherine?
 I got enough.
 You're bleeding.
 What does that mean?
 Oh, my god.
 What do I tell my brother and...and Matt?
 You mean we'll come up with a lie.
 I gave you today just like you asked. And I understand that you would never do anything to hurt me, and I promise I will keep your secret, but...I can't be with you, Stefan. I'm sorry. I...I just can't...
 Sorry.
 You're up early. Where are you going?
 Wait. Shouldn't you be going to school?
 You shouldn't skip school. If they find her, we'll know. That's what cellphones are for.
 Is Stefan here?
 Where is he?
 How can you be so arrogant and glib after everything that you've done?
 If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.
 But I'm not.
 Where is Stefan?
 Stefan? Stefan?
 Where is Vicki?
 What happens now? Because my brother is out there searching for her with the rest of the town. What do I tell him?
 So, she's a vampire with issues? What am I supposed to do? Because I'm lying to everyone that I care about. What's gonna happen to her?
 Hey, Vicki, How are you?
 Hmm, who are you calling?
 Vicki, you can't see Jeremy anymore.
 Even though you could hurt him?
 I know you think that but I can't take that risk. You're gonna have to let Jeremy go now.
 All I am saying is Jeremy is not getting involved in any of this. I mean it, Vicki.
 She threatened me.
 How long before it settles? Hours? Days? Weeks?
 Well, how long before you learned to control it?
 What does that mean?
 Or worse.
 I need to get going.
 Please Stefan. There's only so much I can take.
 Hey. So, um, do you wanna hang out tonight? We could go to the, uh, Halloween thing at school. Could be fun!
 I know you're upset about Vicki. I heard she called Matt. But you can't be with her. She needs to get better. The best thing you can do for her is let her go.
 I know you may not see it, but trust me Jer. It's for the best.
 Yeah. I didn't know that I was coming till an hour ago.
 He's not talking to me right now. We got into fight.
 She's here?
 Where did Jeremy go?
 I..I've gotta find him.
 Thank God.
 I lost track of Jeremy. I was worried.
 No. Vicki, don't do this.
 Matt, it's...it's okay.
 Stefan. She's gone.
 Jeremy.
 Vicki, no!
 Ah!!
 Get him out of here.
 You did this. This is your fault.
 People die around you. How could it not matter? It matters, and you know it.
 Nothing. some idiot with some fake blood got me. I'm gonna go home and shower.
 I don't know where she is.
 You're a good brother, Matt.
 Maybe.
 Where is he?
 Do you understand what happened tonight?
 She was going to kill me.
 I'm so sorry, Jer.
 Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. it's okay.
 Oh, my god. come here.
 Are you okay?
 He's a mess. I don't want him going through this again. He's just a kid.
 Can you make him forget?
 Stefan, please. I don't know how he'll ever get past this. I just want him to forget everything that happened.
 It's what I want.
 I want you to tell him that Vicki left town and she's not coming back. That he shouldn't look for her or worry about her. He's gonna miss her, but he knows it's for the best.
 Part of me wishes that I could forget, too...Forget meeting you, finding out what you are and everything that's happened since.
 Yes, it is. Because I don't want it to be like this. I don't wanna feel like this. But I can't. With everything that's happened...I can't lose the way I feel about you.
 I asked Stefan to help. I thought that, by helping Vicki, he was helping my brother.
 No.
 Yes.
 
 I don't think the Sheriff suspected anything. Jeremy had no memory at all. All he knew was what Damon made him know.
 I can't do this Stefan. Every time I look at Matt or Jeremy, all I think is that Vicki is never gonna come back. And they'll never know why. Around you people get hurt and people die. I can't I just...it's just too much....
 No, Stefan you have to stay away from me.
 So are you.
 Yeah. Well Logan's a jerk.
 Since when do you do homework?
 What do you think? Alien?
 No. 
 I'm sorry.
 Yep.
 I'm tired of thinking...of talking I...
 Stefan and I broke up.
 You wanna make it up to me. Get my mind off of it.
 Hey!
 OK.
 It's kind of a bad week for that kind of stuff.
 OK, I swear.
 Right.
 None. What are you doing?
 Bonnie what's going on?
 I believe you.
 No of course not. Bonnie I just...don't understand though. If your Grams asked you to keep all this a secret, why did you tell me?
 I'm Elena. Who are you?
 Is he here?
 No.
 That's okay. 
 What are you doing here?
 Right. The girl in the towel.
 You mean she's a...
 Oh, okay, well....she kept staring at me. It was weird.
 I-uh...it was a mistake.
 I can't. Stefan I can't, and that's the problem. I'm keeping all these secrets from everyone. I can't even tell my best friend. Do you know how hard that is? It's like I need to talk to someone but the only person I can talk to is you....and...
 Well, thank you for coming by.
 Are you going to Caroline's party?
 Really? Wow-um, happy birthday then.
 Actually I—I think I'm gonna stay in tonight.
 You haven't given him a lot of reasons to be happy lately.
 It flares up in the presence of psychopaths.
 What did you do to my brother?
 When you did what you did to Jeremy's memory of Vicki, what else did you do to him?
 But he's acting different. He seems okay with everything and a little too okay. I mean he's studying; he's not doing drugs; he's not drinking; are you sure you didn't do something else?
 Towel girl.
 
 
 
 But not with you.
 Yeah, he can't be himself with me.
 You seem so sure.
 Go for it. 
 Hey Lexi. It was really nice meeting you.
 Hi!
 I couldn't miss your hundredth and...whatever birthday. 
 What is it?
 
 No, you can't do that!
 I'm not trying to save him, I'm trying to save you! You have no idea what this will do to you, please Stefan.
 Stefan please. Please just-just talk to me; Let me be here for you. Talk to me.
 Have you even talked to Bonnie?
 Be the bigger person.
 Why are you so pissed at her anyway?
 
 He's avoiding me.
 
 And you always see your ancestor Emily?
 Two weeks ago I'd say no, but now...
 I don't get it. Why Emily?
 And it all started when you got the necklace?
 Okay, what does Grams say about it?
 You weren't in class, I was worried.
 A simple "I didn't kill my brother" text would have sufficed.
 So, what did you wanna tell me?
 Back off from school or from me? 
 
 You need to stay as far away from Damon as possible.
 I don't want you to be alone. You're sleeping at my place tonight, we can make a whole night out of it.
 Whoa! Where are you going?
 Are you okay?
 What's your Grams gonna say?
 
 Hey. Thanks for coming. I wouldn't have called if it wasn't important.
 He threatened her, Stefan.
 She has this necklace. Caroline got it from Damon, and she gave it to Bonnie, and now Damon wants it back. He's tormenting her.
 It's not just any necklace. It has to do with Bonnie's heritage. It belonged to one of her ancestors who lived here during the Civil War...
 
 And now Damon knows, and for some reason he wants that necklace.
 It's an antique iron setting with a 
 What?
 Will he tell you?
 
 I don't know, Caroline.
 
 It's true. I watched her throw it into a field!
 Caroline, please.
 That's not true.
 I don't know.
 Did that just...
 Hold on. I got it.
 Okay, fun's over, Caroline. You made a point, and I get it. Now give it back.
 I don't know. Nothing. Jeremy, are you home?
 Bonnie! Bonnie! What's going on, Bonnie?
 Try the other door. I'll check the hallway.
 Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Open the door!
 What happened? Are you okay?
 Caroline, come on.
 Bonnie?
 
 You guys can't leave.
 Where are you going?
 Bonnie! Bonnie! Oh My God! Emily!
 Wait!
 I don't know. The door, it's not...
 It's Bonnie.
 Emily is possessing her. She said something.
 She said "I won't let him have it. It must be destroyed." And then she just left.
 I don't know. 
 Bonnie!
 Her neck, it's healing.
 How do you feel? Are you okay?
 I'll explain everything, Bonnie. Okay? Let's just get out of here. Bonnie. Bonnie, look at me. Trust me. He's not going to hurt you. Come on. Come on.
 Is she in danger of becoming...?
 I'm gonna tell her the truth.
 I can trust her. I need someone to know, someone to talk to. I can't live in secret.
 You saved her life. I'm sorry, Stefan. I thought that I couldn't be with you, but I can. You don't have to push me away. I can do this. 
 What? No! I know you think you're protecting me, but...
 Don't go Stefan. Please...You don't have to. This is your home. Please, don't go.
 You're just gonna walk away? Don't walk away, Stefan! Stefan! 
 Jeremy's got his sketch pad out.
 Nope. But don’t say a word. The minute we encourage him, he’ll put it away.
 
 I've stopped asking questions. The answers get scary.
 Logan?
 I hope you slammed it in his face.
 Three strike rule, Jenna. You're not even aloud to watch the news.
 Did I miss something?
 Kind of weird, don’t you think?
 Yeah, how are you doing with all that?
 Hmm?
 
 
 What am I supposed to do? I’ve already begged him not to go. If I ask again, I’m being selfish. It is what it is.
 What? Why?
 Did you just...?
 Oh, God.
 See you later, ok?
 Bye.
 So, you have no idea who it could be?
 And you're sure it’s not Damon?
 So what are you gonna do?
 When I saw you, I...thought you were coming to say goodbye.
 Still wanna be an astronaut?
 I can remember the tinfoil that you wore on your head.
 How are you doing?
 Yeah, it is.
 What about you, Matt Donovan? I heard about Caroline.
 Hey.
 No?
 I’m guessing you’re not here to plan the path for your future. 
 The blood.
 Didn’t love anything enough to stick to it?
 How long before that would happen?
 
 
 You can’t, I get it. I heard you the first time and the second time, and I appreciate you looking out for me but, please, if you’re gonna leave, then just go.
 What’s going on?
 Logan’s here.
 Stefan, what’s going on?
 Let’s go.
 When Logan came to the house, what did he say?
 I’m serious, Jenna. How did he act? What did he say?
 Ok, listen to me very carefully. Do not, under any circumstances, talk to him again. I’m serious, Jenna, like ever!
 Hi Mr. Saltzman.
 Ok, um, excuse me.
 
 
 Caroline?
 Where's Logan?
 As in...?
 Yeah, I’m starting to see a lot of things, Stefan. Come on. I’ll, uh, I'll give you a ride.
 I know.
 What I said before about you leaving. It was harsh.
 You asked me what I wanted my future to be. I wanted to be a writer. My mom sort of push me into that direction from the time I was able to read. She supported me, encouraged me, bought me my first journal, and then she died. And I can’t see myself being a writer anymore. That was something that we shared. I know that you think you put all of this bad stuff into my life, but my life already had it. I was buried in it.
 It doesn’t make it any less painful.
 No.
 You don’t get to make that decision for me. If you walk away, it’s for you, because I know what I want. Stefan, I love you.
 Don’t.
 Yes, you can. 
 I’ve never been in your room before.
 Do you leave everything here when you come and go?
 A lot of memories.
 A little. You? Uh...
 Ok.
 Ah!
 Damon?
 It's my seat belt. I can't get it.
 Uh-uh.
 I look like her...
 Where are we?
 Georgia? No, no. No, we're not. Seriously, Damon. Where are we?
 I...I...
 But my car...there was a man...I hit a man. But then he got up, and...who was that?
 Where is my phone? OK. We really need to go back. Nobody knows where I am. Pull over. I mean it, Damon. Pull over! Stop the car!
 
 Why are you doing this? I can't be in Georgia. I wrecked my car. I have to go home. This is kidnapping.
 You're not funny. You can't do this. I'm not going to Georgia.
 What are you trying to prove?
 That's my phone.
 
 Where is there?!
 Am I gonna be safe with you?
 You promise not to do that mind control thing with me?
 Can I trust you?
 So, where's my car?
 What about that man in the road? Was he a...?
 You didn't know him?
 Where are we? You brought me to a bar? Damon, I'm not old enough. They're not going to let me in.
 I'm not roped in. Actually, I'm dating his...
 Okay. So, how did you two meet?
 Hi, Jenna. I'm so sorry.
 I was so tired last night. I fell asleep at Bonnie's. And then this morning, I just wanted to get to school.
 You know, Stefan and stuff.
 I'm here.
 You lied.
 So, you didn't lie?
 How am I connected to Katherine, Stefan?
 And I'm supposed to believe that?
 Don't pretend to care. I know you're gloating inside.
 Let's just say that I'm descended from Katherine...does that make me part vampire?
 Did Stefan think that he could use me to replace her?
 How can you even eat? If technically you're supposed to be...
 
 I'll have one too.
 Time out, remember? For five minutes? Yeah, well that five minutes is going to need a beer.
 That's three! 
 Whatever. All right. Who's next? Another round, Bree.
 
 Hello?
 Jenna! Hold on, it's loud in here.
 Huh? Yeah. No, I'm good. Everything's fine. Hold on, I can't hear you.
 Hello ?
 Damon, no!
 No!
 What are you talking about? What did he do?
 I don't understand.
 Lexi? Lexi was your girlfriend? She told me about you. She said that you were human.
 Lexi turned you?
 She loved you. She said that, "When it's real, you can't walk away."
 Don't. Don't, please, don't hurt him...
 Lexi loved you! And she was good! And that means you're good too. Be better than him. Don't do this. I'm begging you! Please.
 Thank you.
 So, why did you bring me with you?
 Seriously?
 I used to be more fun.
 I saved your life!
 
 Hi.
 You could have told me.
 You said no more lies. Only the truth. I can handle the truth, Stefan. As crazy as it is, I can handle the fact that you are a vampire. And that you have a vampire brother. And that my best friend is a witch. I can accept the fact that the world is a much more mysterious place than I ever thought possible. But this...this lie, I cannot take. What am I to you? Who am I to you?
 And when did you figure that out? Before you kissed me? Before we slept together?
 What?
 Then when was it?
 But that was...
 You were there?
 Oh my god. When I woke up in the hospital, nobody could figure out how I got out of the car. They said it was a miracle.
 Why do I look like her?
 Why do I look like her, Stefan? What are you not telling me?
 How do you know all this?
 What else do you know?
 Now is not the time you want to talk to me about lies.
 Okay...Question  am I adopted? I trust you to tell me the truth too, Jenna. How could you not tell me? I thought we were closer than that.
 I don't want to hear it! 
 Stefan, who was that man in the road?
 I wish. I never really saw his face. He was wearing a hoodie. All I can remember is that there was these black boots coming towards me.
 
 Hi. Um, keep the change.
 No occasion. Just a little friend gift.
 Your friendship is important to me.
 Because you've been avoiding me, and I wanted you to know that whatever is going on with you and Matt, it's ok.
 It's a little weird, but 
 I'm with Stefan now. Matt understands that. He knows he has to move on.
 And it gets weirder. I looked at my birth certificate. It lists Miranda and Grayson Gilbert as my birthparents. None of it makes any sense.
 And second of all?
 Ah, ok, look, I have to go to the store. My outfit for the dance is severely lacking accessories.
 Ok. Bye.
 
 Hey, who's this?
 Why me? What does he want with me? A-and if he's trying to kill me, then why call first?
 This is Jeremy's pocket watch. How did you get it?
 What happened to it?
 Why did my father have it?
 Did you know them?
 So you're coming to the dance?
 Why didn't you tell me, Jenna?
 If my mom were here right now and I asked, she'd tell me the truth.
 Well, why were my parents' names on the birth certificate?
 What else do you know about her? The girl?
 Hey, Jenna. Jenna? Jeremy?
 Where is he?
 
 He was invited in.
 No. He was too busy trying to kill me.
 You think there's more than one?
 What do I have to do?
 I'll do it.
 I'll be with the two of you. I'll be safe.
 Having fun?
 He wanted to come. I promise. He'll behave.
 No, but if I'm gonna be with Stefan, then I have to learn to tolerate Damon. It's not like I can kill him.
 Where did they go?
 I would love to.
 May I have this dance?
 Shouldn't you guys be able to sense each other or something?
 Not unless he has a pompadour.
 Come on. I'm sure you looked great back then. Are there pictures?
 Seriously, what was it like, the fifties? Cause in my mind, I have this picture of somewhere between "American Bandstand," "Grease." It's all varsity sweaters and milkshakes.
 Ok, but there were poodle skirts?
 
 Ooh!
 Maybe he's not gonna show.
 Ahh. The horror.
 It's my choice. I decided to be here. I officially signed up for it, so I don't wanna hear you apologizing anymore.
 Show me how it's done in the fifties.
 Come on. One move?
 You really can't take him anywhere, can you?
 Stefan, the back corner.
 No.
 
 What do we...how are you gonna find the others now?
 But...
 Is it weird if I say yes?
 I should feel more upset or scared or something, but I...feel kind of exhilarated.
 Yeah, I guess. 
 Still...
 What?
 Well, then why would you be worried about telling me?
 
 Then don't, and I'll help you, whatever it takes. Ok?
 Mmm. Good morning.
 Damon! Please!
 And it has to be right now?
 Since when am I helping?
 I'll look for it tonight.
 OK, what exactly is a grimoire, anyway?
 He doesn't 
 Oh, right, yeah.
 Oh! No, come here.
 Shh.
 Do you think Damon really believes us? That we're both trying to help him?
 You know...I really think that Damon believes that everything he's done, every move that he's made, he's done for love. It's twisted, but kind of sad.
 So what do you think will happen if the tomb gets opened and Damon gets Katherine back?
 What's this?
 Hey. Just going through some stuff, feeling sentimental. Dad had this old family journal from years ago. I thought I'd dig it up.
 Yeah, what do you know about it?
 Oh. So where is it now?
 Um - he'll be here soon.
 Don't do that.
 You know what. That move was deliberate.
 Is what real?
 
 I'm wearing vervain, Damon. It's not going to work.
 Of course you can.
 Trust breeds trust. You have to give it to get it.
 
 I can understand that you would do anything for her, yes.
 Shh!
 
 I thought there might be something about my birth parents.
 I will. When the time is right.
 That's Stefan.
 No. Damon, leave him out of it!
 Damon!
 Jer, did you tell anyone other than Mr. Saltzman about Johnathan Gilbert's journal?
 Who else did you tell?
 OK, I'm alone. Give me all the deets, Bonnie. I'm dying.
 Gentleman, huh?
 So, why don't you?
 
 You better.
 Where's Damon?
 Aren't you going to go with him? If he gets to the journal before we do, then...
 What is that?
 How did you get it?
 
 Here's a reference that he wrote about Emily. 
 Why isn't your father buried in your family's tomb?
 Are you sure the grimoire's in there with him?
 Great.
 And I said I would do whatever I can to help.
 This town is my home, Stefan. My friends and family are here. You're here. I don't want that tomb opened any more than you do.
 I'm sorry that you have to do this.
 Not many girls can say they've done this.
 Is that it?
 Aspirin must be downstairs. Is my head supposed to hurt like this?
 Are you OK?
 You didn't do anything wrong. Don't forget that.
 Okay.
 I understand.
 Who are you? What do you want?
 Bonnie? 
 Bonnie?
 Oh, you're okay!
 Come here.
 Shhhh.
 They can hear.
 No, he had all of us fooled!
 It must have something to do with the tomb and Emily's spell book.
 Damon said it could be used to open the tomb.
 I was trying to keep you out of it, hoping it would never come to this.
 They need a witch to break the spell and let the vampires out.
 I know.
 Who are you?
 Bonnie's not gonna open the tomb.
 Do you really want Katherine out that bad?
 Then what is it? Or who is it?
 
 Which is what?
 Is there anything to drink here?
 Stefan!
 So what do we do now?
 We need to let him have Katherine back. He's not going to stop until he gets her. If we help him, maybe that ends it.
 What other choice do we have?
 He already agreed once.
 He's hurt. There's a difference. I think I know what I have to do.
 Stefan.
 I convinced Bonnie to help you.
 I'm not gonna say that I'm sorry we got the grimoire without you last night, because I'm not really.
 I was protecting the people I love, Damon. But so were you, in your own, twisted way. And as hard as it is to figure, we're all on the same side, after the same thing.
 Yes you are, because you were willing to work with us yesterday.
 Okay, when we were in Atlanta, why didn't you use your compulsion on me?
 You didn't. I know you didn't. But you could have. You and I...we have something. An understanding. And I know that my betrayal hurt you, different from how it is with you and Stefan, but I'm promising you this now, I will help you get Katherine back.
 Ask me if I'm lying now.
 Then we'll deal with it.
 The Duke party. I forgot. I hope they stay clear of the church.
 Ah, I'm sorry, guys.
 I just want to get this over with. Are we ready?
 That's it? Just water from the tap?
 I just figured maybe it would have to be blessed or mystical or something.
 I don't think it's Latin.
 What's happening?
 What?
 Enough. Both of you. Look, he needs leverage. He needs to know that you're not going to shut the door when he gets inside. I get it. I'll go.
 What is that?!
 Damon!
 Damon? 
 His father did.
 No, please don't!
 He's right behind me.
 Stefan, what are you doing?
 What is it?
 Can't? Can't what?
 You went in there not knowing if you could come back out?
 Oh, my God.
 We can't leave him in there. We promised him. Both of us.
 I think it's working.
 Stefan, they can't hold it much longer!
 Damon! Please.
 I'm sorry.
 How's your head?
 And you don't remember anything?
 No, Jeremy, don't be sorry. You didn't do anything, okay?
 I've got to head on over to Bonnie's for a little bit, but is there anything that you need?
 Okay, well, Jenna's here and I'll be back soon.
 I just got to Bonnie's.
 Yeah. How's Damon? Is he gonna be okay?
 Yeah, of course.
 Yes, I need an ambulance to Oak Street. It's an emergency, quick.
 Bonnie....Bonnie.
 Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie.
 Hey, Bonnie, it's me just checking in, seeing how you're doing. We miss you here. Don't let your aunt drive you too crazy.
 Come home soon. Love you. 
 Thinking, writing. The, uh, funeral for Bonnie's grandma, it brought back a lot about mom and dad. I was wondering...you said that you would do some digging about them, the adoption.
 So did you? Dig?
 Do you think that's her real name?
 That's not far from here.
 Isobel. 
 What about Isobel?
 Wait. "Was," as in...
 
 I don't know. I...I I don't know. If it's true and they are the same person, that means that my birth mother is dead, and I don't know if I could handle that.
 Just that she was killed and the case was never solved.
 You knew that already?
 Well—
 I just don't know what I'm gonna do yet.
 How's he doing?
 Trudie? Tru-trudie Peterson?
 Uh, my name is Elena Gilbert. I wanted to talk to you about Isobel Flemming.
 I think that, um, well...do you know if she had a baby that she gave up for adoption?
 Sure.
 I wasn't gonna come. I didn't think I was, but I was driving, and I hit this stoplight, and it made me think about when I was learning how to drive and then my mom would always warn me about this blind turn on the left-hand side, and then I was thinking about my mom, and—I had your address. I'm sorry for barging in.
 When was the last time you saw her?
 And you don't know where she ended up?
 Do you have any idea who my father is?
 Where did she go?
 
 Oh. Yeah.
 What is this?
 Vervain?
 You know.
 You didn't invite me in, and you're serving vervain tea. You know.
 Wait. What are you not telling me?
 Stefan.
 You look, um...
 Wrecked. You look wrecked.
 Huh.
 How are you doing?
 I'm just meeting Stefan. We're going to the fundraiser.
 So I found out who my birth mother is.
 Stefan. There you are.
 He's fine.
 Maybe this heartache will be good for him. It'll remind him that he has one, even if it doesn't beat.
 So I went to see Trudie Peterson.
 I know. I'm sorry. I didn't plan it.
 She has vervain. She knows about vampire stuff, and it can't be a coincidence.
 This is her. This is Isobel. He gave this to you?
 Oh, my god.
 Why?
 Impressive.
 Hi, Kelly.
 How are you doing?
 I just need some air.
 He killed her? Damon was the vampire that killed her?
 Oh, my god. Stefan.
 I was feeling sorry for him, hoping that this whole Katherine thing would change him. I'm so stupid.
 Why are you protecting him?
 That man.
 I saw that man outside of Trudie's.
 Did you enjoy that? Rubbing it in to Alaric Saltzman?
 Just as I was starting to think that there was something redeemable about you.
 Did I forget to mention earlier when we were talking about my birth mother? The one that gave me up?
 Her name was Isobel.
 Go ahead. Reminisce about how you killed her.
 What?
 Stop looking for what?
 Isobel?
 She's alive? Does that mean she's a 
 Yes. I do.
 Isobel?
 Do you think he's still trying to find Katherine?
 And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
 About what? Isobel, my vampire birth mother, who's related to my vampire ancestor Katherine, who screwed over your vampire brother? Nah...I haven't thought about it at all.
 It'd just be nice if we could get through one day without having to deal with any of it. No vampire mother or brother.
 No vampires but you. I just want to get us back to normal stuff like school and homework and here's a thought  fun.
 Do you think that's a good idea?
 I don't know.
 You do?
 A double date it is.
 OK.
 OK.
 You got me flowers!
 You know, you think that for someone who was around when the car was invented you would have one.
 You know, it's not too late to cancel.
 I don't know, it just seems surreal. Like maybe we weren't meant to get to the normal part.
 Have you ever even been on a double date before?
 What?
 Are you serious?
 So, Matt, How do you like working here?
 How has that been? Having Kelly back?
 Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up. That's how Matt and I first met, we shared a crib together.
 They're drunk.
 Well, we were wasted; it was the first time I ever got drunk. I blame Matt.
 And Matt had me pretend that I was choking so we could get away.
 And I ran, slipped on the wet floor and bit it in front of everyone. Do you remember that? 3 stitches, a hangover for days and I was grounded from seeing this one for a week.
 What?
 I was just trying to make conversation.
 Caroline.
 I'm sorry, you have the wrong person.
 How's everything going?
 Everything's great.
 "That man over there just called me Katherine"
 No, there was nothing familiar about him at all.
 No, the whole point of the night was to not have to deal with this stuff. We need to get through one night. One normal night.
 No, I'm not sure, but I don't know what else to do. Look, if there's another vampire in town, he'll still be here tomorrow. We'll deal with it tomorrow.
 Do you guys want to watch a movie or something?
 Of course.
 Caroline...
 You're being ridiculous.
 You're not the back up.
 Now it's about me and Bonnie?
 If it's not vampires, its girlfriends.
 Sorry I'm bailing.
 Normal people don't have chaperones or bodyguards or baby-sitters. We're normal tonight, remember?
 Stefan, I can't live every minute afraid that someone is gonna come after me. I won't, it's not living.
 How was your night?
 Yep.
 I'm home, teeth brushed, and ready for bed. Save and sound.
 Is everything alright? You sound serious.
 I had a really nice time on our date tonight.
 No, I'm serious. In a way it was exactly what it was supposed to be.
 Hey, you're still up.
 Looks like the there's a big storm rolling in. Can you help make sure all the windows are closed?
 I can't believe you made a deal with her.
 Of course she is. Damon gets what he wants, as usual. No matter who he hurts in the process.
 I woke up this morning to learn that all the vampires have been released from the tomb. I've earned snarky.
 I'm not blaming you, Damon. I've accepted the fact that you're a self-serving psychopath with no redeeming qualities.
 I'm sorry. He just makes me so cranky.
 So, what are we going to do?
 Well, what about me? I can't just sit here and do nothing.
 Which means nothing if you're not safe, too.
 Well, that's comforting.
 The 6 missed calls? Sorry. My phone is dead.
 No. Why? Something wrong?
 It's going straight to voice-mail. Where could he be?
 What happened? Where is he?
 Why not?
 I can get in.
 I'm going!
 Why are they doing this? What do they want with him?
 We gotta do something.
 We can't let them hurt him. We gotta get him out of there.
 Mr. Saltzman. We need your help.
 Stefan's in the house. Damon's a vampire. He can't get in. We need you. I would go, but...
 Stefan told me about your ring.
 Mr. Saltzman. Please. It's Stefan.
 What are these?
 That's your plan? You're just gonna take them all on yourself?
 I'm going with you guys.
 You need me. I'll get in. You could distract them, and then I'll get Stefan out.
 I'm going.
 Damon, now is not the time to be the lone ranger.
 You can't stop me. It's Stefan we're talking about here. You don't understand.
 Can you just not joke around for 2 seconds?
 Yeah.
 What about you?
 Can you make it?
 Yeah. Come on, keep going. Come on.
 Come on, it's right over here.
 Stefan...
 No!!!
 Stefan...
 Stefan...Stefan...No, Stefan. Stefan, Stefan. Stefan! Stefan!
 Stefan, please. Stefan! Oh, Stefan, please get up. Get up, Stefan. Stefan.
 Here.
 No.
 Stefan. My wrist. Here. Take my wrist. You need more blood.
 No. I trust you.
 Stefan. Stefan!
 How are you doing?
 Good.
 Yeah?
 I know.
 I've just never...You were like this other person. And it's my fault. I made you...
 Matt...
 Jer...Are you okay?
 Come on Jeremy, going to school! Walking out the door now!
 Thank you.
 Uncle John! Hi.
 How long are you staying?
 Okay, well, I'm gonna go to school, I'll see you later.
 He said his trip is open ended.
 Does anyone?
 Thanks, I think I'll suffer this one alone; you've been through enough.
 Of course Matt.
 So, was Caroline still baking for you guys, around the clock?
 Jeremy wrote this?
 I really hope you're right because I've done so much to protect him from all of this.
 What do you mean?
 It's not safe for them to know the truth. So, yes I keep it from them, but it's only because I love them.
 I know it's hard to understand but Stefan is different. He would never do anything to hurt me.
 Why would he write a report on vampires? Do you think he's starting to remember?
 I...I can't.
 I don't even know how to talk to him anymore. I mean, we used to be a lot more open with each other. But now, with all these secrets just piling up...You know, I haven't even told him that I am adopted yet.
 What about you, how are you doing?
 I've been really worried about you and I missed you.
 It feels like a lifetime.
 Stefan, what's wrong? Stefan?
 Oh good you're here.
 Stop messing around.
 What?
 Perfect, we'll just add it to the growing list of how everything is falling apart.
 Uh...nothing.
 Look Damon, I'm worried about Stefan. He says that everything's okay but he's clearly struggling. How long is it gonna take before he goes back to normal?
 It's been a few days.
 He's not himself, Damon.
 Please don't make me sorry for asking you.
 He's not you, not even close.
 Hey.
 Do you have some time to talk?
 Not here. Come on. Let's get out of the house.
 I'm sure they would have eventually.
 Because...I don't know. It's weird. Going you're whole life thinking you're related by blood to someone.
 No, Jer...you're my brother, that's all that matters.
 So, Mr. Saltzman said you've been doing great in history now.
 He loved your vampire paper.
 What drew you to that subject matter?
 Gilberts aren't crazy.
 Ouch.
 Hey!
 Are you drunk?
 You're totally that drunk high school guy at parties sneaking booze.
 How worried do I need to be?
 You hate dancing. I usually have to beg you.
 There's really no one dancing.
 You'd be surprised what Stefan can accomplish when he puts his mind to it.
 Is he gonna be okay?
 History teacher three o'clock.
 Beautiful.
 DJ had a change of heart.
 I don't know.
 Matt!
 I'm sorry, my fault. I'm clumsy.
 Excuse me?
 Stefan, it's fine.
 Have you noticed what your brother has been up to?
 He knows that her death was ruled an overdose.
 No, I don't want you to compel him.
 Damon, no I'm serious. I'm not going to do that to him again. I'll handle it.
 Jer? I heard about your conversation with Sheriff Forbes.
 The coroner's office confirmed it. If that's what they said happened then...
 What do you think happened?
 They're just doing what they can to move on.
 Jer, just let it go, okay? Whatever it was she's gone now.
 Yes...I do.
 Stop it, that doesn't mean anything.
 Of course I would.
 This is rare, believe me.
 No, it's great that you are enjoying yourself. Thanks for making me dance.
 Sure.
 No, not in a while.
 Oh my god.
 Matt! Stop it! Tyler! Stop it, you're hurting him! Somebody help us.
 Are you okay?
 I don't know. Put your head up.
 Stefan? Stefan? Hey! Are you okay? What happened?
 Tell me about it.
 Are you okay?
 Are you sure?
 Oh my god you scared me!
 What happened? Is everything okay?
 Talk to me.
 Stefan, tell me.
 And then what happened?
 But you didn't?
 That's okay; I need you to tell me these things.
 Stefan, you're gonna get through this. I'm gonna help you pull through. It's gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay.
 I'm not.
 Stefan, I'm not.
 I'm not, okay?
 I love you too.
 Nice car.
 I didn't know you were coming back today.
 Does that mean you're okay now, with all the cravings?
 I'm okay with that.
 You're welcome (pause, they look each other). We're gonna be late.
 Okay.
 Bonnie!
 Hey, I tried to grab you after class but you already taken off. How are you? How's your family?
 Everyone here really missed you.
 I hope that you understand why I called...I wanted you to know before you came home.
 I know it's been really hard...
 The Founders' court? Did I miss something?
 Oh my god! We signed up for that so long ago...I completely forgot.
 I can't.
 I'm sorry for the short notice; I didn't even know that the contest was coming up much less that I would be in it.
 My mom was really into this Founders' day stuff. She was even Miss Mystic in her day. I kind of want to do it for her.
 Okay, I'll see you tomorrow, I love you.
 I recognize that I haven't been as involved this year that I used to be.
 I've been distracted and I let a lot of things slide.
 But I'm aware of what an honor this is and I want you to know that I take it seriously.
 This was really important to my mother. She believed in community, family, honor and loyalty. It's the legacy she left for me.
 This is ridiculous.
 Sorry. Only one of us was around when the dance was invented.
 Woah!
 You seem to be in a good mood.
 Hey, I'm not complaining.
 Bonnie. Hey.
 Bonnie, do you have a minute?
 It'll only take a minute, please?
 Bonnie, you have to tell me what's wrong.
 What do you mean not worth it? You barely said ten words to me and you won't even look at Stefan. Is that what it is? Is it Stefan?
 I'm so sorry Bonnie. What can I do to make it better?
 Hey.
 I heard you're driving.
 Thanks.
 What do you mean?
 He went through a lot, he was in bad shape for a while but he's bouncing back now.
 Are we ready?
 Thanks for helping me.
 You know I remember when my mom and I were first applying for this, she was so excited.
 I was. She just made it sound like so much fun. Lots has changed since then.
 I don't have cold feet. I just...I think I'd be enjoying it a lot more if she was here.
 Okay, I should go put my dress on. Be careful with that thing, don't hurt anybody.
 Are you okay, Amber?
 Do you need some privacy so you can change?
 Hey, you can't be back here.
 Does it have to be right now?
 What are you talking about?
 What?!
 I know he's been a little edgy but he said that was normal.
 Oh my god.
 I can't believe this. I mean, it's Stefan that we're talking about here.
 This is all my fault; I'm the one who fed him the blood in the first place.
 I know about the blood, Stefan.
 When?
 It's changing you.
 Are you hearing yourself right now? You've been stealing blood and lying and you say that everything's fine? Everything's not fine, Stefan!
 It‘s not about Damon. It's about what's happening to you.
 I just...I need a minute.
 What happened to Matt?
 I don't know, he just disappeared somewhere, I don't know. What am I doing? I never should have gone through with this.
 I need to find Stefan, this isn't me, I'm not this person anymore.
 Where is Stefan?
 What are we gonna do?
 I don't know.
 Congratulations!
 What is it, did you find him?
 Oh my god! He wouldn't hurt her, he won't!
 Stefan!
 Stefan stop it!
 No, we just found her and then called Damon.
 Okay.
 Bonnie, can we talk about this?
 Bonnie, please!
 I know.
 That wasn't you.
 That's what the blood makes you.
 I know this isn't you Stefan.
 No.
 No, you can't scare me off.
 Because I did this, this is my fault; I'm the one who made you drink the blood.
 This isn't you.
 I'm not gonna let this happen to you.
 Stefan, I'm not gonna give up on you! I believe in you!
 It's okay. It's okay.
 It's okay, Stefan. Its okay. You're gonna be okay.
 I'm sure.
 It has to.
 I'm gonna stay here.
 Stefan.
 I love you, Stefan.
 It's so hard to see him locked up like this.
 You helped.
 It had nothing to do with you actually caring about him?
 Did you ever figure out what that is?
 Pearl didn't say anything else about it?
 I've been avoiding him, actually. That, and I've been here most nights.
 Is that a problem?
 Heh. See you later.
 I'm just grabbing some clothes, and then I'll be right over. How's Stefan?
 He has to eat what's his favorite...Kind of, um...
 Type of animal blood that he prefers?
 Heh. Your joking doesn't help.
 I would say, "drop dead," but...
 Uncle John. I didn't see you there.
 I'm actually just heading out, so...
 What did you want to talk about?
 Know what?
 Which mother?
 How you feelin'? Damon says you need to drink that. You need it, Stefan. Can't survive without it.
 What? Don't say that.
 Why would he say that?
 Will it? Because he seemed to be in a lot of pain.
 I didn't mean physical pain.
 The teacher? Alaric? Are you two friends now?
 Right.
 I'll be fine.
 So are you. Otherwise, you wouldn't be leaving.
 Yeah, you could. But you won't.
 No.
 Then I'm stupid. You need to drink this.
 Drink.
 No.
 Talk to me, Stefan. Why are you doing this?
 What are you talking about?
 I know that.
 You need to be able to talk about these things, Stefan. I need to hear them. Come upstairs. We can talk about it more, and we'll keep talking as long as you need.
 And when you feel the same way...I'll be upstairs.
 Were you expecting anything else?
 So, how was the "errand"?
 I thought you didn't care.
 I think he's getting there. But he's got a lot of guilt that he has to deal with. And it doesn't help that you've spent the last 145 years punishing him for Katherine getting caught.
 No, it's no one's fault, Damon. I'm just...saying you're not exactly innocent. You've made it your life's mission to make him miserable.
 He said there was more.
 Damon...Damon. Tell me.
 Oh, my God. He said he wanted to die. That's why he won't feed. Now I understand why, but...
 Don't do that. Okay? Don't pretend like you don't care.
 Stefan. Damon told me the rest of the story. I thought I might find you here.
 But you didn't. And if you die now, it's not gonna change what happened.
 The night that my parents died...I blew off family night so that I could go to some party. I ended up getting stranded, and they had to come pick me up. That's why we ended up in the car at Wickery Bridge. And that's why they died. Our actions are what set things in motion. But we have to live with that.
 You also made a choice to stop, to reject the person that the blood made you. You made a choice to be good, Stefan.
 That's the person who jumped in the water to save the family whose car had driven off the bridge.
 That's the person who saved my life.
 Then tell me.
 There will be no next time.
 Maybe I don't. But what I do know. Is that you can take this, throw it in the quarry, and let the sun rise. Or you could take this ring and put it on and keep fighting.
 It's your choice.
 I'll be upstairs, OK?
 Good night, Damon.
 I'm supposed to help build the Miss Mystic float for the Founders' Day parade. If I don't I get the wrath of Caroline but I wanted to check in first.
 Checking on Stefan.
 What's the matter?
 Don't forget who helped me.
 No. I'm still been avoiding him. Why? What's he up to?
 I've got to go I'm late.
 Hey Mr. Saltzman.
 She wants to see me, Damon.
 I don't really have a choice.
 I want to do it. I want to meet her. If I don't, I know I'll regret it.
 Can you hear me? Thanks for coming, I'm nervous.
 I'm happy that you're here. I love you.
 You've met Katherine?
 Is that how you can walk in the day?
 Who's my father?
 A name would be nice.
 Why did you compel that man to kill himself? Right after he told me to stop looking for you.
 Human life means that little to you?
 No it's not. I know other vampires, that's not true.
 Why did you want to meet me? Can't be to just catch up.
 How do you know my uncle?
 So what made you want to be one?
 No.
 I'm sorry but I don't have what you're looking for.
 I don't have it.
 He's not going to give it to me.
 Hi.
 I met my birth mother.
 Is that Emily's spell book?
 That's the vampire compass.
 Yeah that's it. Well, a part of it. Damon only has the one piece.
 Does it say what it does?
 Yeah, I'm sure. Why?
 Hey, have you seen Stefan? I need to find him.
 Yeah. What's up? What's going on?
 Anna? I didn't know that you guys were still friends.
 I haven't talked to her, Jer.
 Why do you say that?
 No, but Jer...Jeremy wait! Jeremy!
 Isobel. What are you doing here?
 I don't want you in my life.
 Matt is not involved in this.
 Look, you shouldn't be here. You need to leave.
 No!
 Why are you doing this?
 And you're doing this just because of Johnathan Gilbert's invention?
 I told you, Damon is not going to give it to me.
 He'll kill you before he gives it up.
 Jeremy?
 Jeremy?!
 We'll go to him, I'll talk to him.
 What if it's not?
 Just hear me out.
 But it'll be useless, Bonnie can take its power away.
 John and Isobel will never know.
 We're doing this, Damon. And we're doing it my way. Now give me the device. We're wasting time!
 But you can trust me.
 Thank you.
 Now we give it to Isobel.
 Where is my brother?
 Where is my brother?
 Did you really think that I came alone?
 What?
 Jeremy, are you okay?
 I'll be home soon, alright?
 You were never gonna hurt him.
 But you took a risk with Damon. How did you know that he was gonna give it to me?
 For being such a monumental disappointment. It keeps the memory of my real mother perfectly intact.
 Jeremy we have to talk about all this.
 I don't know what Anna told you but there are things that you need to know.
 You read my journal?
 Jeremy, please, you don't understand. The night that Vicki died, it was like mom and dad died all over again. It was all over your face and it hurt so much to see you like that. I just wanted to take away your pain. I'm so sorry.
 No, Jeremy!
 Jer, I....
 Ouch, this dress hurts.
 John?! Is that even possible?
 My whole life I've never liked this man. I...
 No, I'm happy that you told me, I just...I really hope that it's not true. What I am supposed to do? Do I just...confront him and say "are you my biological father?"
 I'm never gonna be ready. Stefan, I have enough problems with the family that I actually care about. Jeremy hates me, and why wouldn't he? My journal gave him every single reason to.
 He's never going to forgive me for Vicki, for taking away his memories, for lying to him.
 Jeremy! I was wondering where you were. You look great, and you guys did a really great job on the float.
 Jeremy, come on! Please! I don't want it to be like this between us.
 Jer, please.
 Is that an insult?
 Look, I know Stefan is worried about our...friendship.
 No, did he mention something to you?
 So, I think you should stop with the flirty little comments and that eye-thing that you do.
 Don't make me regret being your friend okay?
 I don't believe that we can't fix this. I lied, I was wrong. But you're my brother, Jer, and I love you, and I have to fix it. So just tell me, what can I do?
 What are you doing?
 Wait, Jeremy is out here somewhere.
 Stefan, what's going on? What's happening?
 What?
 I don't know what happened, he just dropped.
 What?
 They're rounding up the vampires.
 Are you okay?
 But how did he get it to work? Bonnie unspelled it.
 She did, we saw her do it!
 So we could protect you.
 Can you get my brother, take him home?
 Let's go.
 What?
 Where is Damon?
 You're crazy!
 Utility door, there's one around the side.
 I'm asking you not to.
 As my father, it should.
 I wasn't sure, now I am.
 Stefan!
 Bonnie, what are you doing?
 Bonnie, I've got to get in there!
 Bonnie...Bonnie, what is it? Are they gonna be okay?
 Oh my god!
 The fire is out. The story is the building's old wiring is what caused it.
 No, he just kind of disappeared.
 I'm so glad you're okay.
 You care about him, so do I. But I love you Stefan, and I know that you are worried about that.
 But I love you, Stefan.
 I love you Stefan, you!
 You have nothing to worry about, okay?
 Jenna called, Jeremy's home, I'm just gonna run over to the school to pick up my dress, my clothes and the rest of my stuff and then I'll check on him.
 What are you doing here?
 Which was...?
 Thank you.
 Maybe it is.
 Why do you sound so surprised?
 You're welcome.
 Hi...
 I don't want to talk about it.
 Sorry.
 Thank you.
 Sure.
 I looked everywhere. Yeah, someone definitely took my stuff. I'm just gonna check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital. Can you meet me there? Okay. I love you Stefan.
 Jeremy?! Are you up?
 I looked everywhere.
 Yeah, someone definitely took my stuff.
 I'm just gonna check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital, can you meet me there?
 Okay, I love you Stefan.
 Jeremy? Are you up? (She hears a noise in the kitchen and goes toward it.)
 Hi, I-I need an ambulance to 2104 Maple Street.
 What?
 Jeremy! Please, Jeremy, wake up!
 He's okay.
 He said that Anna gave him her blood and then he took these pills and now...I mean he looks fine but then again so do you. So, I just...I don't know.
 Should I call a paramedic up here? What should I do?
 Don't say that Jeremy! Jer, why would you want that?
 Stefan...
 What about the pills that he took?
 I'll be right there.
 But...
 Yes, you do.
 Bonnie. How's Caroline?
 What?
 Is there something that you can do? Like a spell or something?
 No, no way.
 It's too risky, I can't agree to that.
 Yeah, one of the tomb vampires got into the house and almost killed John.
 You were there?
 When were you at the house?
 Okay, I don't have time for this Damon.
 Where have you been?
 No, you didn't.
 No, Jenna, you didn't.
 Stefan?
 What happened?
 I told Jeremy, I can't lie to him anymore.
 No, I'm not alright. I thought that with all the tomb vampires gone things would get better.
 Katherine was in this house, that means she's been invited in, what are we gonna do?
 Very helpful, thank you.
 And you thought it was me?
 Stefan wait, he kissed Katherine, not me. I wouldn't do that. We don't have time for this guys.
 John must know something. There has to be a reason why Katherine tried to kill him.
 What's that?
 Is that smart?
 John?
 I'm Elena. I'm not - I'm not Katherine.
 We need to know why.
 Please, tell us why she's here. What does she want?
 You see the world with such hatred. It's gonna get you killed.
 Hey, I just have to swing by home to pick up Jenna and Jeremy so we can go to the Lockwoods'. How did you leave him there, John?
 Asked? You threatened him.
 Good. I want him gone, Stefan. I know that I shouldn't feel that way but I don't want someone like that in my life. Or Jeremy's life.
 So what now?
 Please Stefan, don't fight with him.
 That's not the problem, Katherine is. She's already messing with both of your heads and Damon is not stable when it comes to her. The last thing we need is to make things worse.
 Bonnie, I know I'm late. I'm getting in the car now. I'll be there in five. (hangs up.)
 Yeah. Well he is...he was the mayor.
 Hey, how are you doing?
 Damon.
 We should be able to talk about this. Damon, we're close enough now. I really want to know how you are doing.
 I think that you're hurt.
 No, you don't admit that you get hurt. You get angry and cover it up and then you do something stupid.
 That's not a surprise. I'm surprised that you thought I would kiss you back.
 Bonnie, what happened?
 You gonna be okay?
 That's not what I meant.
 I'm gonna go check on Jenna and Jeremy. Let me know when you guys are done.
 Oh god, you scared me.
 Thanks. For, um, for looking out for us. For me.
 Have you been drinking?
 And you're upset. That's not a good combination.
 Come on, Damon. That's a lie. You care.
 Damon...
 No.
 Damon, don't! What's wrong with you?
 Stop it! You're better than this, come on.
 No, no, no, Damon! I care about you. Listen to me, I care about you(Damon smiles slightly and entwines his hands with hers hoping to hear that he loves him back). I do but...I love Stefan, it's always gonna be Stefan.(Damon looks really hurt and angry by this and tightens his grip on her arms)
 Nothing, Jeremy. It's okay, just go back to bed.
 No, Damon, stop it!
 Damon! NO!!!!!!!!
 He didn't see the ring.
 There's nothing good about him. Stefan, not anymore. He's decided what he wants. He doesn't want to feel, he wants to be hated, it's just easier that way. He got his wish.
 I hate him, Stefan.
 Is he okay? Stefan, is he okay?
 It's okay. Oh God.
 She is my ancestor. Hey, I moved the student booth into the cafeteria.
 I don't know, I can't explain it. It's creepy, that's all I got.
 I don't but I could sit here and be tortured by the not-knowing or I could get these prizes to the ring toss.
 No Bonnie, I haven't and I won't and I don't want to talk about Damon or anything else that's vampire related okay? I'm human. And I have to do human stuff. Otherwise, I'm going to go crazy.
 Well because she's not human, obviously.
 Hey, did you...
 I was just hoping that this carnival would reel him back into the land of a high school teenager.
 Yes, we all are. We're going to be boring high school students who live in a world where the "v" word is not uttered.
 Then later you're going to take me to the Ferris wheel, we're gonna ride to the very top and then you're gonna kiss me and my heart will flutter like a normal high school girl. Do you see a running theme here?
 Uh, no "D" word okay? That has been deleted from the list of topics that we can discuss.
 Okay, I can grab some from the science club. Also we lost a speaker in the karaoke room.
 You mean I can do more than just freak vampire havoc?
 Hey, Carter, right? You're with the carnival.
 Okay, great.
 Yeah Bonnie, show him the problem.
 What do you want, Damon?
 Whatever it is I'm not interested.
 But why?
 But why Caroline?
 You're not gonna kill Caroline.
 It's not an option Damon.
 You agree with Damon, don't you? Stefan?
 Stefan. Hey.
 Well we can't let it end that way. She's doing this to me, isn't she?
 Where could she be? What is it? Do you hear her? What's going on Stefan, what is it?
 No, no, no, no, Caroline, That wasn't me. You know that. That was Katherine.
 Stefan, we've got to get her inside.
 Damon, she's my friend.
 Bonnie, it wasn't his fault.
 Bonnie, what are you doing?
 Bonnie, stop it!
 Bonnie! Bonnie, stop it! You're going to kill him!
 Bonnie!
 Because this isn't us. Bonnie, this can't be us.
 What about the guy that she...
 Damon's right, isn't he? It won't end well for her.
 I just can't believe what this day has turned into.
 I was stupid to think that it could be. I mean, nothing about my life is normal. My best friend is a witch, my friend is a vampire and I have a doppelgänger who's hell-bent on destroying all of us.
 No, it's not your fault, Stefan. It's no one's fault you know? It is what it is.
 I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just that...you know what? I'm fine. Okay, I'm gonna to call you tomorrow, okay? Good night Stefan. (She leaves.)
 Hi. What time is it?
 Stefan what are we doing here? We could get caught.
 Stefan...
 But Stefan, how are we gonna get to the top?
 What?
 It's not going to get any easier, is it?
 Isobel's research from when you guys were at Duke together.
 Aside from vampires, what else?
 Wait, like werewolves?
 We were hoping that Isobel's research could help us figure it out what it is.
 Which part? Digging through my birth mother's life work or going to Duke with Damon?
 Well, I'm not sure about the first part but then again Ric is a good buffer so we can bond in our anti-Damon solidarity. I wish you were coming though.
 It's okay that I'm going, right? And be honest because if it's not then I can just stay here and we can take care of Caroline.
 You hate it though.
 I love you too.
 Hey, are you okay?
 Yeah, thanks to a ring that you didn't know he was wearing.
 Did you?
 You're lying.
 You're not gonna kill her.
 You touch her and I swear I will never speak to you again.
 Right. I forgot that I was speaking to a psychotic mind who snaps and kills people impulsively. Fine, go ahead, do whatever you want.
 If by "manipulate" you mean "tell the truth" okay, guilty.
 I'm Elena Gilbert, Isobel's daughter and a descendant of Katherine Pierce. And this is Damon Salvatore who you just shot.
 Look, we need your help okay? We need to see all of Isobel's research, anything related to Mystic Falls.
 Is that all there is about her?
 Here, take this.
 No, that he can't do. He is very capable of being a first rate jackass.
 There's nothing in here about Katherine that we don't already know.
 Now who's manipulating who?
 Why would they do that?
 Hi. Listen we've learned some stuff here and I know it's gonna sound crazy but I wanted to fill you in.
 I don't know what that means or if we should even believe it but it's a full moon, Stefan. After what you saw Mason Lockwood do...
 There's one more thing.
 According to the legend, a werewolf bite can kill a vampire.
 Okay.
 Hey, have you done any research on doppelgängers?
 Did Isobel have anything that explained the link between me and Katherine?
 And more things we already know. Just...I want to know why we look alike.
 Do you know something, or are you just being yourself?
 That's good, Damon, and this is coming from someone who wants to be my friend, but you know what? Friends don't manipulate friends, they help each other.
 Can we just go?
 "Petrova". I saw this on a shelf.
 How did you know that?
 Thank you for the book, Damon.
 This doesn't mean that things are back to the way they used to be, Damon.
 I need to know the truth. When you broke Jeremy's neck, did you know that he was wearing the ring?
 Thank you for being honest with me and the answer to your question, about our friendship is yes. You have lost me forever.
 You had information about Katherine that I needed to know.
 It's your turn.
 What do you want?
 I tricked you into telling me the truth, that's not stabbing you in the back, it's using your own tactics against you.
 I made myself clear, Damon. I want nothing to do with you.
 How did you know about Jenna's barbecue?
 Does Jenna know that you're going to be there because she's not exactly a fan of yours.
 What are you up to?
 Thanks for letting me invite Caroline. She could use a day of distraction.
 Because Alaric is a pity taker. Come on Jenna, be nice.
 That would be my exit.
 Hey. Just checking in. Did you get my message about Jenna's barbecue? Call me when you can.
 Yeah, he hasn't called me back. I'm trying to decide if I should be worried.
 I know that Stefan really hates that part of himself.
 He said that?
 Will you stop plying her with alcohol?
 How is operation Lockwood?
 Would I be the worst friend in the world if I abandoned you and went to Stefan's?
 It's just that he hasn't gotten back to me and I'm starting to get this bad feeling.
 Damon's got it under control here.
 I'm not being clingy, I'm just concerned. You understand, right?
 Yeah, okay, that'll be great, thanks.
 Thanks for this, I appreciate it.
 Why are you being so snippy?
 Okay Caroline.
 I love this song.
 Are you sure the tow's coming? We've been waiting forever.
 Yeah. I'm just gonna call Jenna.
 We can just walk from here.
 We'll come back for it.
 Caroline, what part of "I'm worried about Stefan" didn't sink in?
 Okay, look. I know that you're upset over Matt but will you stop projecting it onto me and Stefan please?
 Where is this coming from?
 Okay, well, do me a favor and stop trying.
 There's the tow, I'm gonna walk.
 Caroline, you're hurting me.
 What's wrong with you?
 Hello? Stefan?
 Stefan?
 How is this possible? How do we look exactly alike?
 Not really. Are you okay?
 Hey.
 It's okay, Caroline. Everything that you were saying was right. It's just hard for me to hear, you know?
 You were just being a good friend...in your own way.
 Well, spending the day with your jealous ex will do that to you.
 If she was going to hurt me, she would have. I was standing right in front of her.
 I'm not afraid of her.
 If Katherine had her way, we'd be breaking up right now.
 You're not actually saying that we should what she says?
 Yeah, no, I get it. She's dangerous. But every day that we are together, it's dangerous. Why are you giving her so much power over our relationship?
 Well, reality sucks.
 This is what she wants. She wants us to fight. She wants to get between us.
 I hated that fight.
 Did you see Caroline?
 We were right. Katherine got to her. She was hanging on to every single word.
 I wish I was wrong but I know Caroline too well. It was so obvious that something was up today.
 I think Damon was listening to us fight too. Are you gonna tell him that it wasn't real?
 All this...just to get you back.
 We're not sure about that yet. The only thing we know for sure is that Mason Lockwood is.
 There is no us. I said that I wouldn't keep things from you anymore. That doesn't mean that I want you involved in it.
 This is dangerous, Jeremy. You have to stay out of it, okay?
 Hi.
 No. I hate fighting with you, even if it's fake.
 Yeah. But it doesn't make it any easier. Neither does knowing that Caroline will be there, reporting everything back to her.
 Just promise me that she won't get her way with us. We can fake a fight, we can pretend that her threats are tearing us apart but none of it is real, okay?
 And when I say, "Fine Stefan, whatever", well that means I love you too.
 Oh, no, sorry. Then what happened?
 No, not since the fight. He's been pushing me away because he thinks that Katherine might get jealous enough to hurt me. I just don't know how to change his mind.
 Yeah, I know that she's dangerous and I know that he's just trying to protect me but it feels like giving up and I just...
 I just thought that we were stronger than that.
 I'm gonna go talk to him.
 Do you still care about Katherine?
 So this is not for discussion. That's what you're saying?
 Okay, when?
 I saw her Stefan. It's like we are the same person. How could you hate her and be in love with me?
 How about we don't bring Damon into this right now?
 Fine, Stefan. Whatever.
 No.
 It's not for the best, Caroline. None of this is for the best. I'm sorry, okay? I...I don't mean to take it out on you. You're just being a good friend.
 What's going on?
 Where are you going? What's going on?
 Hear what?
 Caroline...
 What is it?
 What?
 What is it?
 What?
 Have you seen Stefan?
 Where are they?
 What is that?
 Caroline. Caroline, what is it?
 What?!
 We have to stop her!
 You can't kill them. I'm not gonna let you.
 He said he didn't want it, okay?
 Damon, please!
 Damon says it'll take three days tops for the vervain to leave her system. Maybe even sooner.
 Stefan, I think that we should...what are you doing?
 But you can't, Stefan. You don't have to.
 But the last time that you drank human blood...
 Can we talk about this later?
 Are you serious? Are you pretending to fight? Because I can't tell if...
 Can I take you home?
 Why not?
 Why are you scared? Caroline, you can talk to me.
 I know and I've been so mad at you. But then, I tried to put myself in your position so that I could understand why you would do this to me and to Stefan because he's been such a friend to you. Who did she threaten?
 And you should be. Caroline, we all should be.
 That's the million dollar question.
 Caroline's sleeping on the couch.
 I'm going home. What you did for Caroline's mom, that's the Damon who was my friend. (She opens the door to leave.)
 Do you really think that you can control it?
 So a little bit every day?
 So do I, but I don't want you to do it alone.
 It's you and me, Stefan. Always.
 I'm gazing.
 It's romantic.
 Hey!
 Oh, this is bad of us.
 If Katherine finds out...
 Okay, I, um, I need to be in the shower.
 No, just me. I'm late. I'm decorating at the Lockwood charity thing.
 You think that's really a good idea to be at their house today? Mason Lockwood tried to kill you.
 Okay.
 But then we can't touch or talk and no lingering stares.
 What do you think will happen if Katherine finds out that we were fake fighting?
 Ow.
 It's okay. A little bit every day to make you stronger, right?
 I love you, Stefan.
 You're here.
 Caroline's not coming. I told you.
 You know, eventually, you're gonna have to talk to her.
 There are no sides, Bonnie.
 Come with me.
 Not here. Some place quiet. We have to talk.
 It's a lot, I know. Katherine's doing everything that she can to drive me and Stefan apart and Caroline just got trapped in the middle.
 I'm sorry, I don't want to keep things from you but you've made it pretty clear where you stand with the whole vampire thing.
 No - no, Bonnie, of course not.
 You're my best friend, Bonnie. I didn't mean to let this craziness with Caroline get in the way of that. But, she needs you too.
 Damon, what are you doing here?
 What's going on?
 Jeremy, what is he making you do?
 Uh, no. No way. No, no, no, no. There is no "Damon and you". There's Damon and whoever Damon is using, and those people, they end up dead. Whatever is going on Jeremy, I want you to stay out of it.
 I know, but I have no idea what's happening. Damon's got Jeremy into something and you've got Bonnie with you and I'm sorting stupid masquerade masks for Mrs Lockwood.
 She had something else to do.
 Matt, come on. No, she's not.
 I'll be right back.
 What's going on?
 I know, but I am. What's going on?
 Hey. Be careful.
 Stefan?!
 Stefan, what's happening?!
 What's going on in there?!
 Stefan!
 Stefan!
 Caroline, Stefan's down there and the chain is rusted.
 No, no, no! You can't, it's filled with vervain. Caroline, we've got to get him out. Now!
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's okay, keep going. Come on!
 Hey! Oh, Oh my God.
 Pull him up!
 Hold on! I need to find the stone.
 Hold on! I think I found it!
 I got it. Come on! Bring me up!
 Oh, god! Stefan!
 Stefan! Stefan.
 I've got the stone, Stefan. Stefan, it's gonna be okay, everything's gonna be okay.
 Where is Jeremy?
 Who is she talking to?
 There were a few hiccups, but yeah.
 Who is it?
 Hello?
 Katherine.
 No.
 Jenna, no!
 The doctors told Alaric that she got lucky. She's gonna make it. She's gonna be okay.
 No, nothing. It's all a part of Katherine's mind compulsion.
 Because she's trying to send a message. That she could get to anybody.
 No, it's not.
 We were stupid. Sneaking around, thinking that we weren't gonna get caught.
 We did this. Stefan, Jenna's in the hospital and Jeremy could be next. All because we didn't - we didn't listen to her. Because - because we're together. Stefan...
 Then let me say it. I've been so selfish because I love you so much and I know how much you love me. But it's over. Stefan, it has to be.
 Don't, Stefan.
 It has to be.
 It doesn't matter, Damon. She won. Katherine won.
 The doctors said that you have to take it easy.
 It was a freak accident.
 I got it.
 Make lunch.
 We're not gonna do anything, Jeremy.
 Yes we can. If it keeps us safe then we can.
 She won't. Katherine hurt Jenna because I didn't do what she said. I'm not doing it now, me and Stefan are over. She wins, the end.
 Where are you going?
 You're welcome to hang out. Alaric's coming over. It's gonna be pizza and bad TV.
 Uh, no...not with what's going on with me and Stefan.
 What?
 Okay. Well, have fun.
 You look good in a suit.
 I don't think so, Matt. There's so much about me and Stefan that'll never work.
 That's because you are an invalid. Where's Jeremy? Isn't he hungry?
 He went to that?
 I'm gonna get some napkins.
 What's going on?
 I haven't heard from anyone all day. It's like everyone's been avoiding me and now Jeremy's supposedly at the party? He hates stuff like that.
 So then you'll be okay if I just head out, try to meet up with everyone.
 What are you hiding, Rick?
 So Stefan's at the party too? He would never go to the party for himself; he did that stuff for me.
 Hey guys, I'm gonna go to bed. You good over there?
 Good night.
 What the hell is going on?
 You guys are trying to kill her here?
 Okay, stop with the "we", are you guys crazy? You're gonna get yourselves killed.
 And how am I supposed to feel if one of you guys gets hurt because of me?
 Bonnie, it hurts.
 Are they?
 No.
 No, Jeremy...
 No Jeremy. What I need is for you to be safe.
 I'm okay, I'm okay. Bonnie took away the pain and I think I'm healing.
 I will. I heard about Katherine, is it true? Is she really gone?
 Stefan...I...
 I want to be with you, Stefan. You know that but first, I need to wake up and know that the people that I love are safe. I need to feel safe. Do you understand?
 Yeah Jeremy, I've got my car. Tell Bonnie that whatever she did, I'm starting to feel better. Yeah, you can drive her home. I'm just gonna go straight to bed. Okay.
 What do you want?
 Please, I'm hurt.
 What do you want with me?
 But I'm not. Please, whatever you-
 But I'm not Katherine. My name is Elena Gilbert; you don't have to do this.
 What do you want?
 Who's Elijah?
 Why am I here?
 Why won't you?
 You got me, okay? It's not like I can go anywhere. The least you can do is tell me what you want with me.
 Delivery to who? Elijah?
 Who is he? Is he a vampire?
 What do you mean the originals?
 So you know Stefan and Damon?
 Who are the originals?
 But why me?
 The curse? The sun and the moon curse?
 What do you mean I'm the key? The moonstone is what breaks the curse.
 The sacrifice?
 Tell me more.
 Who were you running from?
 Yeah, she said that. What does that mean?
 What did you do?
 Katherine.
 You're scared.
 Please, don't let him take me.
 No, what about the moonstone?
 I know that you need it and I know where it is.
 I can help you get it.
 It doesn't work that way.
 In the tomb, underneath the church ruins.
 It's with Katherine.
 I'll come with you, just please don't my friends, they just wanted to help me out.
 Just let her go.
 I'm okay. I'm okay.
 I got your message.
 I'm tired, Damon.
 I thought that was gone. Thank you.
 Please give it back.
 Why do you have to say it with my necklace?
 Damon, don't go there.
 Is Stefan here? He called. He said it was important.
 What is this about?
 You.
 Who is he?
 Like Elijah?
 Okay, so you're saying that the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me?
 School. I'm late.
 It's okay, I know where it is.
 Tell everyone I wasn't feeling well and I went home from school.
 And keep Stefan busy. I don't want him to know what I'm up to.
 You managed to keep me occupied when Katherine paid Stefan a visit.
 Caroline, as my friend, do you promise or not?
 Okay.
 Because he would never be okay with me doing this.
 Yes, I'm sure. She's the only one who knows the truth about Klaus. The only one who can tell me how to stop him.
 Yeah. I can't just sit back and wait. I have to know, Caroline. Please.
 Katherine?
 I'll be okay from here.
 As long as I stay on this side of the door, she can't hurt me. Please.
 I brought you some things.
 I want you to tell me about Klaus.
 I also brought you this.
 It's your family history. It says in here that the family line ended with you. Obviously that's not true.
 I also brought you this.
 You don't look so good. How long before your body shuts down? 10, 20 years? It must be painful to desiccate and mummify. I can't even imagine.
 More blood?
 Thrown out?
 It was kept secret?
 So, what did Klaus want?
 By sacrificing the Petrova doppelgänger.
 What does the Petrova blood line have to do with Klaus?
 So you ran before he killed you?
 Rose never ended up taking you back to Klaus, did she?
 You killed yourself?!
 But it didn't work. You didn't really escape, you've been running from Klaus ever since.
 Rose and Trevor spent the last 500 years running because you used them. Trevor just got killed.
 You don't even care that you ruined their lives.
 So how much of your little story is true?
 Okay, assuming it's even partially true, that's the reason why you came back isn't it? Because you wanted to be the one to hand me over to Klaus.
 So you got Mason Lockwood to find you the moonstone.
 What else do you need to break the curse?
 It's not just me or the stone, is it? Otherwise there would be no reason to trigger Tyler Lockwood's werewolf curse.
 So you need a werewolf?
 What else?
 What else?
 Caroline.
 So you were gonna just hand us all over to be killed?
 Stefan, what are you doing here?
 Caroline told you.
 I knew that you'd stop me.
 What if she isn't? You didn't hear what she said.
 That's the problem, you won't but you'll die trying. How's that any better?
 What?
 I can't talk about it, Stefan.
 I wanted to know the truth and I got it. It's not just me that's in danger. It's Caroline and it's Tyler and it's Bonnie. They're all part of breaking the curse. I can't blame anyone else anymore because it's not because you came into town or because you and I fell in love. That's not why everyone that I love is in danger. It's because of me, everything is because of me.
 I heard something.
 It's okay, Jenna, don't worry about it.
 Seems like things are good.
 Then I'm extremely okay with it.
 Why?
 Come on in.
 You don't believe her, do you?
 How do you destroy it?
 How do you guys even know this is gonna work?
 You discussed it with Bonnie.
 It's Katherine who has the moonstone. She's not gonna give it to you.
 Wow. I mean, it sounds like you guys already have it all planned out.
 Except for one thing. I don't want you to do it.
 What about Klaus?
 Is that before or after he kills everyone that I care about, including the two of you.
 I know. Everybody keeps saying that.
 I, uh, sorry, I...
 Actually, I came to talk to you.
 No, it's not. From what Stefan told me, your friend Slater obviously has more information about Klaus. You and Damon just gave up before you got it.
 There's more to learn. We just have to find a way to learn it.
 Because you owe me. One word from me, and Damon and Stefan could have killed you for kidnapping me.
 We're having a disagreement, okay? They're willing to risk everyone that I love and I'm not.
 And you've proven that you couldn't care less whether I'm protected or not. So, we're back to you taking me to Slater.
 How would you like to be able to walk during the daylight?
 I think I know a witch who's willing to do whatever it takes to help, if you're willing to make a deal.
 Mm-mm. No. We didn't come all the way out here for nothing.
 Looks like whoever blew up the coffee shop found him and killed him for his information.
 What are you...?
 I'm sorry about Slater.
 Um...It's password protected. I can't get in.
 How is she?
 Her boyfriend just died. There's no such thing as overreacting.
 Not personally, no. I just knew that he kept detailed records of all of his vampire contacts and I was hoping that he could point me towards Klaus.
 Do you know Slater's computer password?
 I understand that. Do you know his password?
 What if I could convince Rose to turn you?
 Will you show us his files then?
 I know. She doesn't.
 These are all leads to vampires?
 Tell him that we're trying to send a message to Klaus. The doppelgänger is alive and she's ready to surrender.
 Get him the message, please.
 I'm getting Klaus' attention.
 It's either me or my family.
 What are you doing here?
 You called him?
 You said that you understood.
 No.
 I'm not going with you.
 When have I ever made a decision? You and Stefan do that for me. Now this, this is my decision.
 You're not listening to me, Damon. I don't want to be saved. Not if it means that Klaus is gonna kill every single person that I love.
 No!
 Thank you for coming.
 
 She was just scared. She didn't mean to run.
 I can't believe Elijah's alive. Why do you think he killed those two vampires and just let us go?
 Actually, the only thing that was stupid was that I got caught. 
 Damon, good night, okay?
 Stefan! Stefan!
 Stefan's in there, Damon! How could you let this happen?
 You didn't even have to go after the moonstone in the first place!
 The right call? How was any of this the right call?!
 Damon, let go of me! Damon, let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me!
 Please.
 Now that you've got this back, what are you gonna do with it?
 And according to Katherine, Klaus becomes vengeful.
 Bonnie, can't this wait? Stefan is stuck in the tomb with Katherine. We've got to get him out.
 Don't listen to him. He thinks that he's protecting me, but he's wrong.
 What?
 I'm trying to prevent everyone else from getting hurt.
 Um, to see Stefan.
 No, I'm not.
 Are you serious?
 How did you...?
 Klaus killed Katherine's entire family just because she crossed him. I can't let that happen.
 What did you do?
 Do you think this is funny?
 What does Stefan say about this?
 And what did he say about Elijah still being alive?
 Why not?
 Hold on a second. Tonight's the full moon?
 Hey, what are you doing?
 What is this stuff?
 Jenna was just asking me to get you to help her with the boxes.
 What do you want?
 Why did you kill those vampires when they tried to take me?
 Isn't that exactly what you're trying to do?
 So, what is your goal?
 Like you?
 You don't know where he is, do you? So you're trying to use me to draw him out.
 How do I know you're telling the truth?
 What kind of a deal?
 And then what?
 Just like that?
 How are you gonna be able to keep everybody safe?
 You know witches.
 I need you to do one more thing for me.
 Hey!
 Stefan? Stefan? You're standing right behind me, aren't you?
 I don't want us to be apart anymore. Ever.
 Don't ruin the moment.
 You're about to ruin the moment, aren't you?
 Katherine's locked away in the tomb.
 Yes but Elijah promised to keep me and everyone else safe as long as we play by his rules.
 Please don't go after Isobel.
 Stefan, I made a deal with Elijah.
 Stefan, I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
 Vervain. I made it light but are you sure? Just because Katherine built up a tolerance...
 Are you okay?
 How can Elijah compel another vampire?
 Um, it's not bad.
 He left. I need you to talk to him. He's convinced that he has to find Isobel but I think that's gonna upset Elijah.
 Damon. Is she gonna die?
 Like poison?
 I'm sorry.
 Just get in bed.
 You're not gonna die.
 It's just a room with a bed. Maybe I expected there to be silk sheets.
 I doubt that.
 I'm not giving up on anything. Here.
 I call it my best option.
 That's not fair.
 I spoke with Bonnie. I know that she had the help of another witch; unless you mean it's Elijah's witch, so no, I don't.
 It's okay Rose. Just get some sleep. You'll feel better when you wake up.
 Yeah, of course, here.
 It's okay, everything's gonna be alright.
 It's Elena. Rose, Rose! I'm Elena!
 I'm not Katherine!
 It's me, it's Elena.
 You're gonna be alright.
 It was just for a second.
 I'm not. I'm not, but you need to rest.
 You're not alone. I'm right here.
 Damon's bedroom, you're in Damon's bedroom.
 Tell me about it.
 Sounds beautiful.
 I brought some clean sheets.
 It's Elena, I'm worried about Rose. I think you should come home.
 Rose?
 Oh my god.
 No.
 Rose, stop, stop, it's Elena. I'm not Katherine.
 You're hallucinating. I'm not Katherine. I'm not Katherine.
 I don't know.
 Hey, Stefan, it's me. I don't know where you are but please call me. It's important.
 Hey. Have you heard from him? Do you know what he's up to?
 I know.
 Us humans.
 What do we do?
 Damon...
 I did but then I came back to make sure that you're okay.
 You know I don't believe that.
 Damon, I'm your friend.
 And a friend usually knows when their friend is hurting.
 There you go, pretending to turn it off, pretending not to feel. Damon, you're so close, don't give up.
 You feel guilty.
 Okay, I will.
 Good night Damon.
 Stefan, you're home.
 I know.
 It's okay. Did you find her?
 Uncle John.
 What are you doing here?
 We're not doing that. We did that last night. No more avoiding. Why are you here?
 What do you mean that's all you can say?
 I'm sorry, Jenna. I should have told you earlier, but 
 He's not here, he left. I don't know where he went. He just blew in, announced to Jenna that he's my dad, and then took off.
 Apparently?
 Yeah. Jenna's head spinning, but I'm okay.
 No. You know, Stefan thinks that he's telling the truth about wanting to help me.
 No, I don't believe him for a second.
 What are we gonna do?
 Damon...
 Damon!
 What does that mean?
 Wait, I'm coming with you!
 Damon, I mean it. All I'm asking is you try to keep it together. Be the better man.
 You totally blew her off.
 You didn't have to be rude.
 Stefan? What is it?
 Stefan was worried that you 
 No, Damon, not Tyler. Do whatever you need to do to get Caroline back but just leave Tyler out of it, okay?
 Damon please, okay? Too many people are dead.
 Doing what?
 Be the better man, Damon.
 Nothing.
 Look, we don't have time for this. We need to get Caroline back.
 I'm coming with you.
 You can't tell me what to do.
 I've got that covered.
 Are you saying I should put my faith in you? After everything that you did to Stefan and Damon?
 You don't get to use that word. That word is off-limits to you!
 You're right. Facts are facts, so listen up  you may be my father, but I'm never going to be your daughter, you got that?
 Enough, already. I don't want you here. and I can't make that anymore clear.
 Yeah, I know, you're here to protect me. Got it, get in line.
 Isobel?
 Are you okay?
 Did you hear that? I don't believe him, Stefan. I just don't. What happened tonight? How's Caroline?
 We're gonna slumber it!
 Unf.
 
 Good and much needed. 
 Okay. Now. Today. Take me far, far away.
 Because of everything that's going on.
 Uh, this has everything to do with that.
 Beyond ready. Let's go before John shows up and pretends to be a concerned father.
 Nothing's wrong. Just Caroline. 
 I'm good. I just haven't been back here since before...
 I've always loved it here. I want it to stay that way, I was just...having a moment.
 You don't have to wait out there. I'm all good.
 Oh, my god. You can't get in.
 Stefan, I can't.
 My parent's left this place to John Gilbert. He's the only one who can invite you in. I'm sorry. I I completely forgot.
 Stefan Salvatore, I hereby invite you into this home.
 Hey, hey, hey!
 Jeremy broke his arm diving off this dock when he was six. My dad taught me how to fish right off the edge over there. So many memories. Do you ever think about us, what our future will be like, our memories?
 Now there's a box that we shouldn't open.
 No. I'd rather just be here...Now.
 My dad did all the cooking, too.
 
 
 I got it.
 So, I'll get a jacket.
 My mom's perfume. 
 Here.
 Bundle up.
 It was my great-granddad's.
 And you look very hot in it.
 Beyond hot.
 Stefan! It's my parents' bedroom.
 What?
 What?
 What is it?
 Oh, my god.
 These must be the other Johnathan Gilbert journals. Jeremy had the one, but John said that there were others. 
 
 Stefan?
 Stefan, what are you doing out there?
 Tyler?
 It's okay.
 What is it?
 I know the deal I made, Stefan. Elijah's very careful with his words. He promised to protect my friends. He never said a word about me.
 If it comes down to the people that I love getting killed or me, I know what my choice is gonna be.
 I'm sorry, Stefan. I'm just trying to keep the people that I love safe. I'm trying to keep you safe.
 How is that any different from when you say that you would die to keep me safe?
 Are you still mad?
 We have a difference of opinion, Stefan. We're not always gonna agree on everything.
 You would know.
 A lot. It's insane the things he wrote in his journal.?
 That he kept from the founding families. Stuff that nobody knows. Stuff that...you never told me.
 He describes you as a monster.
 It sounds like you were Damon.
 How come no one caught on to what you were doing?
 Lexi? Your best friend Lexi? That's how you met her? What was she even doing in Mystic Falls?
 Are you okay?
 Like Damon killing her?
 Johnathan Gilbert got crazier and crazier. I guess that's what happens when you spend your life obsessed with vampires.
 He researched the Originals.
 Later in life, look.
 Pages and pages of questions and scribbles.
 What's that?
 "The wood from one tree and one tree alone, an ancient white oak would bring death to an Original vampire. When the tree burned, all hope was thought lost." He was trying to figure out how to kill an Original.
 "But the ash from the tree was saved and witches forged a dagger to which the ash could be bonded. This alchemic bond provides the necessary poison"
 I wonder if this is true. I mean, do you think this dagger actually exists?
 John gave Damon the weapon that's supposed to kill Elijah? This one?
 "It must be brandished by humans alone, for it will bring death to all demons who wield it."
 What's going on, Stefan?
 What good is talking if you and Damon are just gonna lie to me? If you don't like my decisions, that's fine. There's nothing I can do about that but if you ever go behind my back again, I'll...
 It's my life.
 Then what? This...this...this trip through the past. You being honest. Was there any truth to that or were you just distracting me?
 That is not what...
 Originals believed in truth and honor. It was forbidden for a vampire to kill another vampire. So, the dagger would take both lives. And as long as the dagger stays in place, the Original, for all intents and purposes, is dead.
 You have to go. I need to talk to him alone.
 Stefan, I'm okay. He can't come in the house.
 They shouldn't have done what they did.
 I'm renegotiating.
 I'd like to see you lure Klaus into Mystic Falls after the doppelgänger bleeds to death.
 No, he won't. He'll feed me his blood to heal me, and then I'll kill myself and become a vampire, just like Katherine did. So unless you want that to happen again, promise me the same as before...promise me...You won't harm anyone that I love. Even if they've harmed you.
 Give me your word!
 So, that's it. I mean, as long as we keep the dagger in there, then he stays dead.
 Okay, then...Good night.
 You know, you guys want me to fight, fine, I'll fight. But if we're gonna do this, you can't keep anything from me anymore. From this moment on, we're doing it my way.
 Okay.
 Stefan, we're late for school.
 Stefan, it's school. Remember, that thing that we keep forgetting about?
 Hey!
 Stefan!
 Stefan! Okay, 5 minutes, only 5 minutes.
 What are you doing?!
 Stefan, you're hurting me!
 What is she doing here?
 I don't want you here. Get her out of here.
 I don't need your help and I don't want it.
 Why is she still here? She was free.
 Or maybe she's trying to lure you and Damon back into her web. I want her gone.
 How? All she does is lie.
 Right, but that doesn't mean I want her shacking up with you.
 Hmm, I can't. I told Bonnie and Caroline that they could come over. Bonnie's freaked because she lost her powers and Caroline's having Matt drama again. It's kind of a girls' night. Maybe Katherine can join us.
 John's going to end up dead on the kitchen floor if he's not careful.
 You think we should tell her the truth?
 Not to mention it's becoming more dangerous for her not to know. I just thought that we'd at least hold off until after we've dealt with Klaus. You know, and even then, how do we tell someone what we know? How does someone hear that?
 Like you have to ask.
 Do you believe that Jonas is being sincere?
 Join the club.
 Caroline, how many times have you seen that movie?
 Well, yeah, I mean...
 Hey.
 Girls' night.
 How are you doing?
 He feels terrible.
 No. No, this is about us girls hanging out and you know, we'll be here if you happen to want to talk, or...
 In.
 Alaric's in the same boat with Jenna and maybe that's our mistake. We're trying to protect the people that we love by keeping them out of it, but in the end, we're hurting them anyway.
 What are you doing? Where are you going?
 Sing?
 Yeah!
 Ahh! Oh, sorry.
 I...I wouldn't. Caroline and Matt are...
 If they're happy, I'm happy.
 You're into my brother?
 I'm thinking that...My brother has had more pain in his life than a hundred people's worth of pain, and...He deserves to be with someone as amazing as you.
 Really.
 My phone. Hey, Stefan, I'm at the Grill. I can't hear you. Hold...yeah.
 We have a problem.
 Dr. Martin! I'm so sorry about Luka. I never wanted that to happen, but...at least let us help you get your daughter back.
 You don't need Elijah.
 It's not over yet.
 He'll explain.
 How did you guys convince her to do this?
 Wow. That's...not good.
 This doesn't change the way I feel about you.
 Hey. You made it home.
 Tell me about it.
 I think so.
 Isobel.
 N-n-no. Don't...don't invite her in.
 No!
 I can explain everything, Jenna.
 No. Jenna, please.
 Jenna, please. Wait. Jenna, please wait.
 Jenna, you have to talk to me. I...I need to explain what's going on. Jenna, please.
 She won't come out of her room.
 Nothing. She won't talk to me,
 Hey.
 Where are you going?
 Okay, but, Jenna, please just...
 Jenna, just...
 You know this is your fault, right?
 Ah, this is bad. Between Isobel and Jenna and now Matt, this is disaster bad.
 Heh. I have nothing to say to you.
 You invited her in?
 You don't get to talk, okay, not after everything you've done.
 I'm not buying any of this.
 The last time that you were here, you made it clear that you didn't give a damn about me. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to believe that you want to help?
 And almost killed Stefan and Damon in the process.
 You wanna help? Then get the hell out of my house.
 Do you really think that Isobel's telling the truth that word's gotten out about the doppelgänger?
 So is that the plan? Neither of you will let me out of your sight again?
 Fine. Then one of you 2 bodyguards is gonna have to come with me to the Lockwood luncheon.
 Does that mean that you're taking her to the...
 I wish I did, but he wasn't really one to run.
 We'll help you find him. I just have to accept this thing for Jenna.
 The Historical Society was my mom's baby. She considered all of you family and would be honored and touched by this gift.
 So is that what happened? You were compelled to betray Katherine?
 So you lied. You did find Klaus, didn't you? He knows where I am now. Are you taking me to him?
 What is this?
 What?
 Who was that?
 I never thought I would feel bad about her being dead, and yet...
 Why did they let me go?
 He knows I'm not gonna run.
 What's this?
 You're giving me your house?
 Damon, let him go. He and I need to talk.
 If that's what you thought of her, why did you ever put your trust in her at all?
 You screw up everything, John. Everything you touch just falls apart. But you're the only parent I have left...so maybe I can learn not to hate you.
 Okay.
 For now. As sole owner, I'm the only one who can invite a certain type of person in here, if you know what I mean.
 That's the idea.
 Thank you, Mr. Henry.
 I'm sorry. I completely forgot.
 Stefan. Would you like to come inside my house?
 One of us is. If I let you in, do you promise to obey the owner of this house?
 Seriously, Damon. My way. You promised. I call the shots. No lies, no secret agendas. Remember?
 Then please, come in.
 Thanks.
 To school.
 Right. But where? No one knows. Look, I really appreciate what you guys are doing. And I'll be able to sleep at night knowing that I'll be safe here, but I'm not going to be a prisoner.
 The way I see it, next to Bonnie is the safest place that I can be. Come on.
 Watergate was the seventies, Ric. I-I mean, Mr. Saltzman.
 Hey, Jer. How you doing? Are you okay at the house alone with John?
 You haven't heard from Jenna, have you?
 What's going on?
 Oh.
 I'm sorry, what did you just say?
 Okay, so we find him and then what, hmm? What's our plan of attack?
 Your relatives were such packrats.
 Okay, so what do you think? Twiggy or sexy hippy?
 And what, miss out on all the fun?
 All this time spent worrying about Klaus. I think I convinced myself that he's not real but he is.
 I love you.
 Hey you two. Oh, you look nice.
 I know everyone here.
 Caroline's here. They don't know what's going on. We have to tell her.
 Um, freaking out a bit. You?
 Right. And you won.
 You're good at this.
 What are they up to?
 Is there something going on, Jer? You okay?
 I'm not sure.
 I need to talk to you.
 How could you not tell me?
 No. No way, it's not an option.
 Then we'll find another way, okay? Bonnie, you're not dying to save my life.
 I can't let you.
 No. No!
 What is it?
 What?
 Okay, so where are you taking us?
 Wait...Something's not right.
 Alaric. Are you on vervain?
 He's being compelled.
 What's going on?
 Klaus!
 Oh, no. No, it's not possible.
 Klaus is in Alaric's body.
 Okay.
 Um...Yeah. I'm just...I'm looking for Stefan.
 Uh, just, um, just stay with Matt, okay?
 What are you doing? Where's Bonnie?
 What?
 Bonnie, no!
 No! Oh! Bonnie! Bonnie, Bonnie! Bonnie! Hey, hey.
 Stefan, she's not breathing!
 Stefan! Stefan, I can't find her pulse! Stefan! Do something, please! Stefan, please! Just give her blood, do something, please!
 No! No. No, no, no, no, no! Bonnie! Bonnie, please, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
 What do you mean, deal with it?
 This is Bonnie!
 No. Jeremy. Oh, my God, Jeremy. What about Jeremy?
 I can't.
 This is my fault.
 What did you do with her?!
 Don't talk like I'm not standing right in front of you.
 You knew! Didn't you? You knew that if she harnessed all that power, that she would die, didn't you?
 Bonnie!
 It's okay, it's okay. I just needed to see you for myself.
 It's okay, seriously. Damon explained it all.
 I understand why you did what you did. Klaus was fooled, and Bonnie's alive.
 But let's get one thing straight, Damon. Bonnie will not die for me, I will not let that happen.
 We'll find another way.
 Look, I shouldn't have hit you.
 Good night, Damon.
 Elijah.
 Elijah! It's me, it's Elena.
 You're not invited in.
 Shh!
 I'll tell you. Not here. Can I trust you?
 You look better.
 I'll tell you everything. But we have to work together, Elijah. I need your word.
 No demands. I'm offering you my help. And in return, I want yours.
 The same reason that you haven't killed me. You need my help to kill Klaus. And I need you.
 Yes, I'm fine.
 He's right here.
 No, Stefan, Elijah and I need some time alone.
 Elijah is a noble man, Stefan. He lives by a code of honor. I can trust him. He knows that I'd be incredibly stupid to betray him again. By removing the dagger, I have proven myself.
 It's my decision, Stefan. Please respect it. And make sure that Damon doesn't do anything stupid. I'll be in touch.
 He's here.
 He's taken over Alaric's body.
 Well, what are his other tricks? What is he going to do next? You're the only one who knows him.
 How did you know she's not on vervain?
 No. I'm sorry.
 Klaus took her. We think that she may be dead.
 I don't understand. You say that you want Klaus dead, but you still made Katherine pay for betraying him.
 I heard that. I'm still processing.
 There's a whole family of Originals?
 So your parents were human?
 Right, but Klaus is your brother. And you want him dead?
 That's where the white ash for the dagger comes from.
 So the Sun can't kill an Original. Why is Klaus so obsessed with breaking the Sun and Moon curse?
 What's so funny?
 I don't understand. So Klaus drew the Aztec sketches about the curse?
 But why?
 So it's not Aztec at all?
 What?!
 But if there's no curse...
 What are you talking about?
 What is this curse?
 Stefan...what's wrong? No. No, no, no, no. Okay, I'll be right there.
 Klaus went after Jenna. I have to go to her.
 She's my family, Elijah. I have to. I'll be back. You have my word.
 Thank you.
 Oh, Jenna, thank God.
 I'm so sorry. I never meant for any of this to happen.
 It is true, Jenna. I should have told you. I thought that if you didn't know, you'd be safe. But then things got so out of control and everything I had done to keep you out of it, it just blew up in my face.
 We were just trying to protect you.
 I'm so sorry. I will tell you everything.
 I know, but there's nothing that you could have done. There's so much more to it...
 I know, hey.
 I know. I know. I know, hey. Hey. I'm sorry. Jenna, I am so, so sorry.
 She's in shock. I tried to tell her as much as I could, but I barely scratched the surface.
 It's not your fault, Stefan. It's mine. Anyway...I have to go back to Elijah.
 Stefan, I promised him that I would return. I can't break that promise.
 I'll be okay.
 Back to Elijah.
 Get out of my way, Dam...
 Tell me. What is Klaus's curse?
 A war between the species?
 So Klaus' real father was from a werewolf bloodline? What does that make Klaus? A werewolf? Or a vampire?
 That's the curse that Klaus wants to break?
 But you helped him?
 We have the dagger now. We can stop him.
 What, are you saying that Klaus can't be killed?
 A witch. If they can channel that much power. But it would kill them.
 What if I told you that I knew a witch that could channel that much power?
 You found a way to save the life of the doppelgänger?
 You cared about her, didn't you?
 Stop!
 Elijah and I have renewed the terms of our deal.
 The sacrifice is going to happen, Damon. Bonnie will be able to kill Klaus without hurting herself and Elijah knows how to save my life. I told you I'd find another way. And I did.
 I am.
 No. Bonnie can't use that much power without dying.
 It's not an option, Damon.
 And where do I fit into it?
 And that's where you come in.
 So I'll be dead?
 Then I guess I'll just be dead.
 Do we know if Klaus has everything he needs to do this? Does he have a werewolf?
 You'd think he'd understand why I'm willing to do this.
 I'm the key to breaking the curse. Klaus is here because of me. If I don't stop him, then he's going to hurt people. It's that simple.
 I know the chance I'm taking.
 What's going on?
 Where is Damon?
 You disappeared.
 I need you to understand why I'm doing this.
 I'll be fine, Damon. I'll drink the elixir, Bonnie will kill Klaus and then all of this will finally be over.
 It will work.
 There isn't.
 And then I'll come back to life.
 But I am.
 It's my life, Damon. My choice.
 You won't.
 What are you...
 Damon, no!
 Stefan!
 Get out of here!
 Get him out of here!
 It's okay. It's okay. You're going to be okay.
 Shh. It's okay.
 How could he do that to me? Why?
 It doesn't matter.
 Stefan, I can't.
 Where are we?
 I'm not a vampire yet, you know. My legs still get tired.
 Uh...this morning I was wondering if I would live or die, and now...I'm going to be a vampire. I...I don't really know how I'm feeling.
 God, this is beautiful.
 I can't. Stefan, I just...I can't talk about it.
 We're climbing all the way up to the top?
 Well, can't you do one of your super power vampire jumpy things?
 I guess Bonnie will have to make me a daylight ring.
 And I'll never be able to watch "Bambi" again.
 What's the best part about being a vampire?
 And the worst?
 Aside from the blood?
 How long before you learned to handle both?
 Let's just keep going. We're not even halfway to the top.
 We made it! Ahh.
 Nobody likes a bragger, Stefan.
 Oh, wow.
 Say what?
 There's nothing I can say, Stefan. It's not going to change anything.
 And before all this with Klaus, did you think about it then?
 Why have you never brought it up?
 Didn't stop Damon.
 But he did this to me, Stefan, which means he doesn't really know what love is. And to be honest, I don't know if I do. I'm seventeen years old. How am I supposed to know any of this yet?
 I know that I love you, Stefan. I know that. But my future? Our lives together? Those were things I was supposed to deal with as they came along. I was supposed to grow up.
 Decide if I want to have kids and start a family. Grow old. I was supposed to have a lifetime of those choices, and...now? That's all gone.
 I don't want to be a vampire, Stefan. I never wanted to be one.
 Thanks for today.
 I'm ready.
 No. Stefan, hey, hey, it's fine, it's fine. I'll go. No one needs to get hurt. There's no reason for you to get hurt.
 I love you.
 Close your eyes. Close your eyes.
 Where are we going?
 You're Luka's sister, aren't you? I heard about you. He and your father were looking for you.
 God, I can't see anything.
 Jenna? Jenna, Jenna! Jenna? Hey, hey, Jenna! Jenna!
 Oh, my God. No. Jenna! No!
 He killed her? Why? I did everything that he asked.
 Do you remember what happened?
 Klaus. It was Klaus.
 We're at the quarry. He brought us here.
 Jenna, do you remember...When I told you how someone becomes a vampire?
 Jenna, listen to me. Listen to me; everything's going to be okay. I'm going to get you out of here.
 Greta...Please, just- just let her go.
 No.
 Jenna, don't!
 Let her go. Hey!
 No! No.
 Jenna. It's going to be okay.
 Look at me. Hey, look at me.
 It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
 How are you feeling?
 Vampires can turn off the part that's human. That's the part that hurts.
 No! Jenna, I'm not going to let that happen. I don't care what I have to do.
 That must be the werewolf.
 Greta, witches are supposed to maintain the balance in nature. It's your duty to them to keep this curse sealed.
 Are you Jules?
 Jenna, there was no one else who could have gotten me and Jeremy through all of that.
 But you didn't. 
 No. You didn't. I failed you. I'm so sorry. Listen. Being a vampire, it intensifies your guilt. But it also makes you stronger and faster. You can fight back. I'm gonna get through this. I'll be okay. I need you to believe that. Promise me, when you get the chance...
 Let her go. I understand that I have to die, but she doesn't!
 No, Jenna! We can't leave Jeremy without a family. 
 I-I don't know. 
 
 You can do this. Just relax. Focus.
 What are they saying?
 What is it?
 I have to do something. This can't happen. None of it.
 
 No.
 No! Stefan! No!
 No.
 No, Jenna, no!
 Jenna, no!
 Just turn it off. Jenna. Turn it off. You won't be scared anymore.
 No! Jenna! No! Jenna!
 
 Go to hell.
 What happened?
 I feel fine.
 I'm almost ready.
 Jeremy...
 I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that you've lost so many people.
 What do you want?
 Damon...
 Yes, you were.
 And I need some time, maybe a lot of time.
 We had to get out of the house, Jer. This is our three-hour distraction from reality.
 We need to do this, okay? Breathe, eat, sleep, wake up, and do it all over again until one day, it's just not as hard anymore.
 Hey! Look who couldn't resist an epic romance.
 I'm breaking the rules, you know. Movie night's supposed to be a distraction. Tomorrow we can return to our regularly scheduled drama.
 What? Is it...is he gonna...
 Oh, my God. And he came to the house this morning and...and tried to apologize. I practically slammed the door in his face.
 Stefan...
 No. He's gonna kill you.
 Damon.
 Don't you see? She was toying with you. All you had to do was say no, walk away. You had a choice.
 Where's Damon? What have you done to him?
 Look, I understand why you hate them, but you're wrong.
 Wait. You've gotta let me come with you. He's sick. He's...he's not himself.
 Damon.
 Hey, come on. Come on. We have to get you out of here. We have to hide you.
 Hey. Hey. Relax. We need to get you out of here.
 Look at me. Hey. It's Elena. It's Elena.
 No. Damon. No.
 Damon, stop. You're hurting me. Damon, you don't have to do this. Please stop. You're hurting me!
 Damon....Damon.
 It's okay, Damon. I'm right here.
 No. You won't. I'm here until the very end. I'm not leaving you.
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hang on. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
 Shh.
 I will.
 There's still hope.
 No. 
 It's okay. I forgive you.
 I do.
 I like you now. Just the way you are.
 You're welcome.
 I was.
 Where's Stefan?
 Where is he?
 What do you mean, "he gave himself over"?
 Ahh. It's not early. You're late, for work. Matt just called.
 
 What are you doing?
 I never said yes in the first place.
 Did she find something?
 And you're sure it's a vampire?
 Doesn't mean it's not. I'll call her.
 Tell her thank you for her help.
 Oh, Caroline wait, just...keep tonight small. Please?
 Ugh! (Sighs.)
 Could be more Klaus victims. (Puts down her cup.)
 Are you sure you're still okay on the couch?
 If you need your own bedroom?
 Alright Got it. (Elena starts to walk away.)
 Thanks.
 Hey, I was gonna...
 Oh!
 You heard me! You knew that I was here.
 Sheriff Forbes gave us another location to check. Memphis.
 You don't know that.
 Fine, I'll go by myself. (Starts to walk away.)
 It's a new lead Damon; we haven't had one in a while.
 But...(Damon walks away.)
 I feel like I have to fight Damon every single time we get a lead on Stefan.
 The only reason Stefan left with Klaus was so that he could save Damon's life. I mean, trust me, Damon wants to find him.
 Don't worry about it. Look, yes I kissed him, but it was a...it was a goodbye kiss. I thought he was gonna die. (Sighs.)
 I missed a call from Bonnie. I'll be right back.
 Don't worry I'm not gonna lose it. At least not before the cake.
 You stole it?
 My necklace. I thought I'd never see it again.
 I am happy, Thank you.
 Can you?
 Thanks.
 This is keeping it small? What are we drinking?
 Matt, hey!
 Oh.
 Thank you.
 He doesn't hate you, he hates that he's not with you. Is that my brother?
 Thank you.
 Drink!
 Jeremy's smoking again.
 Talk to him, please. He looks up to you.
 Caroline?
 I was just looking for Damon.
 I think I'm gonna pass on the whole cake thing.
 Is that what you all want me to do? Just get on with my life?
 I'm not gonna give up on finding Stefan, Caroline.
 You want me to make a wish? I just wanna know that he's alive. That's it! That's my wish.
 It's Klaus. Damon's been tracking him without me.
 I don't know.
 Where are you?!
 Don't do that Damon, don't lie to me! I saw your closet.
 Wait! Damon!
 Why didn't you tell me? Why did you keep it a secret?
 All summer, every single time I came to you with a lead, you made me feel like an idiot for having hope.
 Tell me what you know, Damon.
 We're supposed to be in this together. Why didn't you tell me that you've been tracking Klaus' victims?
 What?
 No. You're wrong.
 Stop it, Damon.
 What are you doing?
 What? Why?
 Hello? Hello? Stefan? Stefan, if this is you, you'll be okay. I love you Stefan. Hold onto that. Never let that go.
 You've been dodging my calls.
 Why didn't you tell me?
 He called me, Damon.
 Stefan called me last night.
 He didn't say anything, but it was him. I asked Sheriff Forbes if she would trace the call's origin. It came from Tennessee.
 If he was gone, he wouldn't have called.
 Hi.
 I need you to tell me what you know about Stefan and Tennessee.
 Come on, Ric. Whatever Damon knows, you know.
 Yeah, but Damon's not exactly in the mood to help right now.
 Yeah, but he's still holding on to his humanity, which means he can still be saved.
 Because I'm not the kind of person who checks out. Look, he would never give up on me. I'm not gonna give up on him. Tell me what you know, Ric. Please.
 What kind of places?
 Anywhere in Tennessee?
 Thanks for this. I know it's asking a lot.
 No. Why?
 How do you feel about a little hike through the Smoky Mountains?
 We'll be out of there before the moon is full. If you don't come with me, I'm going by myself. What? You're the one who told me that I could handle things on my own now.
 You were a boy scout, weren't you? A boy scout, slash vampire slayer?
 Wow. You came stocked.
 Vervain grenade?
 Well, since we're exchanging gifts...
 It was yours once. Go ahead. Take it. I'll protect you from whatever supernatural danger we're about to get ourselves into.
 Yeah, but I'm a doppelgänger. It's not gonna work on me. He left it for if I ever have kids.
 Okay, and how 'bout you borrow it until after we survive this? I'd feel bad if I got you killed before happy hour.
 I don't know why you think that you're a lost cause.
 Damon! How are you even here?
 You sold me out!
 If I get out of the water, you're gonna make me go home.
 You gave up on him Damon.
 No!
 My plan is to find him and help him. Damon, this is the closest that we've been to him since he left. I'm not going home.
 I'm not leaving before we find him.
 Then we'll find him before then. Damon, please.
 I promise.
 I said I promise.
 Fine.
 No, thanks.
 Yeah, with my luck, you'd drop me.
 I can see that, Damon.
 The moon doesn't reach its apex for a while. We have time.
 Damon!
 Ric, here. Take these.
 I said Ric.
 If we can get him to talk, we don't have to.
 It's impossible. It's still daylight.
 There aren't supposed to be werewolves out here until the moon is full.
 Damon, we've got to get out of here. We gotta get out of these mountains now! Damon, now!
 We can't leave Damon.
 No. If he gets bit, he'll be dead. I'm the reason he's out here.
 Stefan's out there somewhere and now Damon, and we're just sitting in this car?
 I thought you were checked out of taking care of people.
 You're better at it than you think, you know?
 You're not a lost cause, Ric. You're just lost. But so is Jeremy, and so am I. Our family is gone. We don't have anybody. I'm sorry, but you don't have anybody either, so...We're kind of good for each other.
 Damon?
 Are you okay? Did you...?
 Can you just give me a minute to appreciate that you're not dead?
 Damon, stop being such a caveman.
 Seriously?
 Are you drunk?
 You saw him out there? Damon, is he okay?
 What happened out there? What changed your mind?
 Thank you.
 What do you mean?
 We were under attack, Damon.
 It was too dangerous.
 Why are you being like this?
 I didn't want to see you get hurt, okay? I was...I was worried about you.
 Yes, I worry about you. Why do you even have to hear me say it?
 No, I don't.
 Aah! What are you doing?! Get out!
 Ugh. Oh, my God.
 Six a.m. Seriously? Do you really have nothing better to do at six a.m.?
 Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What? What are you talking about? Where is he?
 He's in Chicago? Well, how do you know?
 Is he okay?
 It's an antique, Damon. Like you.
 It's Stefan's diary. I'm not going to invade his private thoughts.
 I've seen Stefan in his darkest periods. I can handle it.
 Eyes on the road, grandma.
 Stefan could live anywhere in Chicago and he chose this?
 If you're trying to scare me into giving up and going back, it's not going to work.
 He obviously hasn't been here.
 Stefan hid his alcohol. What a monster.
 It's a list of names.
 These are all of his victims?
 What were you doing in the 1920s? Paving the way for women's liberation?
 Where are you going?
 I'm coming with you.
 Finally! I called you an hour ago!
 I told you that I was practically discovered by Klaus and you're worried about what I'm wearing?
 Yeah.
 So you know where he's going to be?
 Okay. Thank you.
 I can do this.
 Where else would I be?
 Come home.
 Look, I know you're trying to protect me, but I can't let you do it. Come with me, Stefan, please.
 I know that.
 Lexi found you like this before. In the twenties, and...and she saved you.
 I can't give up on you, Stefan.
 Just drive.
 What time do you want to go to the Lockwood party?
 It's an old family recipe, okay?
 He thinks I'm going to break. I'm not going to break. I am just going to keep making chili, pretend like I didn't just spend the entire summer looking for someone who didn't want to be found.
 I'm not in denial.
 Please say that's not chili...
 Bonnie!
 Damon helped a little.
 Both of you stop judging. He's just trying to be a good...ow!
 No, no, my necklace.
 It burned me.
 What?
 There is no deal. He's been just as focused on finding Stefan as I have.
 Look, why are we even talking about this?
 No. And I never asked. Hopefully Bonnie will be able to figure it out.
 Beyond. Where's Damon?
 What is it?
 Why would he even show up here?
 I get it. I'll call you later.
 Speaking of doing bad things to good people...
 Where have you been?
 What did you do to him? How do you know the compulsion doesn't work?
 Maybe it's not a bad idea. I mean, it'll help you keep yourself in control now that Stefan's not here to...
 He's Caroline's dad, Damon.
 Damon, no! What is wrong with you?!
 It's an emergency.
 You can't do this anymore, Damon. Not in this town. Not around me.
 Because I don't want you to be what other people think that you are.
 I guess I wish that you didn't have to act like one!
 Thank you.
 Okay, you and Damon were both right. I was trying to change him. But if he wants to be in my life...
 That's not true.
 No.
 I can't, Caroline! If I admit it, if I even thought it for just a second...What does that say about me?
 Do you need me to...
 Yeah, Matt. If I'm doing this, you're doing this.
 And if we don't create these memories now, then what's the point of it all?
 To superglue Alaric's desk shut. I'm making memories.
 Klaus!
 If you're going to kill me, just do it!
 Don't, Klaus. You don't have to hurt anybody.
 Where's Stefan? What did you do to him?
 Bonnie, get out of here!
 Leave him alone!
 He's not dead. Klaus's blood will turn him into a vampire.
 Stefan...
 No! Stefan, don't. He's not going to hurt me. He already said...
 No. Stefan!
 No. You did this to him.
 I don't have it anymore.
 I'm telling the truth. Katherine stole it.
 No, Klaus! Don't do this to him!
 Caroline's dad! Stefan, he was able to resist compulsion. I don't know how, but he did it. Maybe it's possible.
 Stefan, you can control this. When that buzzer goes off, just...just drink from me.
 I don't believe that. You can fight it. You just have to want it bad enough.
 Yeah! That's right, Stefan. Because you love me. You'll fight because after everything that we've been through, you owe me that!
 But Klaus said that if I run...
 There is another way, Stefan. It's for you to fight.
 Stefan...I love you. Fight, Stefan. Don't give up.
 Stefan...
 What did you do?
 Where am I?
 I have to get out of here.
 Wait...You're taking my blood?
 Damon...
 No. No compulsion. I need to remember. All of it.
 He's really gone this time. I watched it happen. After everything that we went through to get...to help him. Now he's just...gone.
 Where were you, Damon?
 Good morning.
 Easy enough.
 That's weird.
 Must be jammed or something.
 Thanks for not sugar-coating it.
 A vervain grenade. I've used one before.
 Oh my god.
 This isn't a joke to me, Ric.
 You don't have to use pronouns. You can say Stefan.
 But you think that I'm crazy. To believe that I can protect myself from a vampire who's flipped the switch on his humanity.
 Today's our anniversary. Technically, Stefan and I met on the first day of school last year.
 I have to be here. I have to put it behind me. New year. New life.
 Hey. Are you checking up on me? Because I'm fine.
 Rebekah? She's living with you now? Why?
 What about Stefan? What is he up to?
 Come on, Damon. I can handle it. What?
 I forgot about the bonfire.
 Relax, Caroline. I'll be there.
 Is that blood?
 So, I'm going to go. Good luck.
 What are you doing here?
 What? Why?
 I'm going to be late for class.
 Let go of me, Stefan.
 I said let go of me.
 Stefan, stop it!
 Klaus compelled him to watch over me. Apparently I'm one of Klaus's assets now that my blood is the only way to create a hybrid.
 I don't know what he is. But he's definitely not Stefan.
 Look, his being here is not good for any of us. We have to do something.
 Seriously, Stefan, leave me alone.
 Who are you?!
 Do you actually know what's happening right now? Stefan called me a human blood bag. He's a completely different person.
 Unh! What are you doing?
 Damon!
 Stop it!
 Like one obnoxious Salvatore isn't bad enough.
 I want to lock Stefan up, at least until this Mikael guy comes, kills Klaus, and the compulsion breaks.
 You've gotten him off of it before.
 Then do it for me, Damon. Every single time I look at him, I feel like I'm going to break. And I'm not going to give him that satisfaction.
 What are you doing?
 I'll lure Stefan away from the bonfire. Then when he's distracted...
 I'm trying to keep Bonnie out of this. I don't trust that Stefan won't hurt her. Caroline, are you covered?
 Which is why it's your job to keep her away.
 So then preoccupy her with your charm.
 We need you to raid your mom's vervain supply. Enough to keep Stefan down for a while.
 Trust me, Tyler, it's in his best interest.
 What is going on?
 Loyal how?
 Excuse me.
 I'm having fun, Stefan. You have a problem with that?
 Uh-huh. Really? You think I'm going to let a blood addict tell me how to drink?
 What look?
 I'm not jealous.
 I'm not jealous, Stefan.
 Whatever. I'm out of here.
 I used to know every constellation. How did I forget them all?
 Fine. Unh. Let me find my car.
 Uh-oh. It's the fun police. I thought that ripper Stefan was supposed to be the life of the party.
 Why? Are you afraid that I'm going to...
 Oh. Ha. That was close. Klaus would not be happy with you.
 Look, Stefan, no hands.
 I knew you'd catch me.
 Yeah. I'm...Fine.
 The plan worked. That's all that matters. Let's just get him out of here.
 I can't! It won't open! What the hell?
 Stefan!
 Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
 Give it to me. I can do it.
 Damon, come on.
 You played your part of the plan really well tonight.
 You had Rebekah drooling all over you and your marshmallows.
 I was faking most of it.
 It's okay if you want to be friends with Damon again.
 I think he kind of misses you.
 Because I still have hope.
 Yes, I do. I know who you really are better than anyone, Stefan. And I'm not giving up.
 No, Stefan, it makes me strong.
 Hey, sorry I'm late. What did I miss?
 What's so funny?
 Hey, Jer, I need you to help me with something.
 I've been going through Stefan's old journals. Every single time that he's gone off the rails in the past, his best friend Lexi's been the one to bring him back.
 I thought if I knew how she did it, maybe I could help him.
 Is that what it's called?
 Do you think it's even possible to contact Lexi?
 No, I can't drop it, Ric. I don't know what else to do.
 Is Anna here right now?
 I didn't.
 I can't drop it, Ric.
 I'll be right back.
 Anna?
 How do we do that?
 Talisman...My necklace?
 I just walked in on Jeremy kissing the reason I'm completely okay with that.
 I wish. Look, I don't have the necklace. Damon has it somewhere. Text him. I'll call you right back.
 You need to disappear or evaporate or whatever it is that you ghosts do.
 You're right, it's yours.
 How did this happen?
 Don't worry. I'm going to let you do that. Right after I help her send the ghosts away.
 Lexi?
 Where?
 I...
 Let's go.
 He compelled him to turn off his humanity.
 I can handle it.
 No.
 I heard you.
 What's happening?
 Hello?
 Listen, I need you to get Bonnie to hold off on sending the ghosts back.
 I was. I am. Look, Lexi's here and she's helping with Stefan.
 I am helping you, Stefan.
 I'm sorry, Stefan, I just don't believe you.
 I can't...
 Jeremy? What happened?
 Where is Anna now?
 She was the only person who heard us talking about it. Of course she took it. Okay? We have to get it back. We have to destroy it and then close the door.
 But what? What, Jer?
 But it's not real. She's dead. Gone. Everything that you're holding on to is in the past, Jer. Are you going to love a ghost for the rest of your life?
 He's at the beginning of his life, Anna. You're just holding him back. You know that.
 Call Bonnie. Tell her that you have the necklace. Get her to send the ghosts away.
 We're running out of time.
 I can't.
 I can't, Lexi. They have the necklace. They're going to close the door.
 It's okay, Lexi, I know what to do now. You can be free.
 No, I'm going to go home, take care of my brother. Be a friend to Bonnie and everything else that I have to do.
 I haven't given up, Stefan. I still have hope.
 But there's nothing that I can do until you get yours back.
 Hey. You can break through this. Fight for it. Feel something. Anything, Stefan. Because if you don't, you're going to lose me forever. I won't love a ghost for the rest of my life.
 So, the Lockwoods really have no idea that these tunnels are underneath their property?
 Wait, what?
 
 So, you really can't get in?
 What do you mean, ancient?
 What is all this?
 
 I don't understand. I thought the Lockwoods came here with the Original Founders in the 1860s.
 How long?
 Vikings?
 Klaus.
 These are the names of the Original Family?
 Okay, this has gotta be one of Klaus's fakes.
 What's the name?
 Mikael...Mikael, as in, the vampire hunter who knows how to kill Klaus?
 Shut up! I'm new at this.
 Yeah, but doesn't Mikael have a weapon?
 Then all we have to do is find out what they mean.
 Well, if the story is about the Original Family living here,  then we go straight to the source!
 I was hoping we could talk.
 Actually, I'd rather talk about this.
 I'm curious why you and Klaus have spent a thousand years running from your father.
 Well then, maybe I'll ask Mikael when we wake him.
 So, then who's rotting in that old cemetery in Charlotte?
 So then, tell me.
 Why don't you want me to wake him?
 She's going to tell me. She's scared of him, Damon. I saw her face. I just have to engage in a little "mean girl" power struggle first.
 I've got this, Damon. If we can figure out a way to kill Klaus, Stefan will be free of his compulsion. So...how does he look?
 He'll have to get over it. Call me later. 
 She's a thousand-year-old vampire, who's joined the cheerleader squad...There is a whole different set of rules that play here, Ric. I got this.
 You invited me over? To talk?
 You compelled your own private runway show?
 I'm not here to help you shop. I'm here to talk about why you don't want me to wake up Mikael.
 The...red one.
 We shouldn't be here...
 Are you gonna root through his stuff all night or are you gonna start to tell me your story?
 Well, Elijah said that your father was a landowner in Europe. How did you guys end up here?
 So, how did you end up here? This part of the world hadn't even been discovered yet.
 The werewolves?
 You make it sound so normal.
 Hello?
 Damon, where are you?
 Yes, I'm fine, but I can't talk right now.
 
 Damon! How could you let him out?
 Did you get your fill of snooping yet? Can we get on with the story?
 Why would you? You don't know anything about who he really is.
 Is that why you did that runway show earlier? 'Cause you don't care about the Homecoming Dance...You know what, I'm just gonna go.
 And you are not going to tell it. You're just bored and looking for someone to push around. Find someone else to play with...maybe you can compel yourself a friend.
 
 So, vampirism was a form of protection?
 A curse?
 Yeah, but why stay, if they were so afraid of the werewolves? Why not...leave?
 In her hands? How could she do anything?
 What?
 But if your mother was a witch, then...
 How did you turn?
 
 Why did Mikael start hunting Klaus?
 Yeah. Elijah told me this part of the story. Your mother had had an affair with one of the werewolf villagers. Klaus wasn't his son.
 
 Always and forever...even though he locked you in a coffin for ninety years?
 But you still love him?
 I'm just looking for one good reason why we shouldn't wake Mikael.
 It's no secret that I want Klaus dead. He has a hold over Stefan's life, and over mine.
 That's the white oak tree that was used in the spell to create the vampires...which means that was when they burned down the tree, destroying the only way that they could be killed.
 Mikael killed the witch by ripping out her heart. But...why is that one connected to the witch's death?
 
 How do you know that Mikael killed your mother?
 He lied to you.
 The cave where you carved your family's names is covered in symbols. 
 And this is the story of her death. The hybrid killed the Original Witch. Not Mikael. Klaus.
 She put the curse on him, made it so that he would be the only one of his kind, and then she rejected him. With the werewolf gene comes aggression and violence...when he turned, all of that was heightened. He killed her, Rebekah. And then he made up this entire lie about your father, so that he wouldn't lose you.
 Then why are you so upset?
 Klaus killed your mother. He has a hold on you, on me, on everyone. He has for a thousand years. We have to make it stop!
 Uh...Damon! Seriously?
 What? How?
 I'm not gonna yell at you.
 I'm not mad. I'm tired. I just...I want to go to bed. 
 Well, they must have carved it from the white oak tree before they burned it down.
 
 I learned, that she's just a girl. That she lost her mom too young, and she loves blindly and recklessly, even if it consumes her. 
 
 And you what? Vervained him?
 Which he planned to use on Rebekah, but instead...
 And what happens when he asks to see Mikael's body?
 Klaus is smart. If we tell him that Mikael is dead, he'll want proof.
 What if he wants to see you in person?
 Y...You want me to actually dagger you?
 Let's just get this over with.
 
 We have to go. Caroline will kill us.
 You know that you can talk to me about Jeremy, right?
 You have to talk about it. He hurt you, Bonnie. I am mad at him, too.
 Bonnie...
 We can't trust Rebekah not to turn on us.
 Bonnie was right. Rebekah may be mad at Klaus now but - he is her brother.
 There are too many things that can go wrong with this plan. Too many people that can make it go wrong.
 Really? What is it?
 You could not go.
 I know how to do it! Alaric taught me!
 Your the one that we should be worried about. If Klaus asks you one wrong question- whole thing falls apart.
 Getting a head start, huh?
 Ever?
 No. But I'm sure that when he does return he'll do it with flair.
 Yes.
 I know it's really hard. So thank you for helping us get Klaus back into town.
 Are you okay?
 You look amazing! But you're missing one thing.
 You should wear it tonight. May I?
 I'm so sorry. I can't leave anything to chance either.
 It had to be done. Rebekah was never gonna be completely on our side.
 Not the way to make me feel better about myself, Damon.
 Stefan's right. Someone's gonna let their humanity get in the way and screw this whole thing up. It's probably gonna be me.
 Yeah- but I feel bad about it. I care too much, that's the problem, Damon. I'm the weak link.
 Do you trust him? Mikael?
 What about Stefan?
 Then we need a better plan.
 Why not?
 What does that mean?
 Yes.
 So, does that mean I don't have to go?
 Kegs and beer pong for Homecoming? That's...different...
 I'll see you there.
 Matt...Hey.
 Umm - slight problem with your Homecoming date.
 How would you feel about a backup date?
 How did this happen?
 I don't understand. Stefan wanted Klaus dead. More than anything. That's what we were counting on.
 Where's Katherine?
 Hey. Damon...Hey! Hey, listen to me!
 We'll survive this. We always survive. Trust me.
 Then we'll let him go. Okay? We'll have to let him go.
 Don't worry about it.
 I feel like I'm going crazy. Totally paranoid all the time.
 Why hasn't he made a move? There has been no sign of him. Nothing. Just my slow spiral into insanity.
 The same dream?
 What if it's not just some dream? What if it's like...you know...witch dream?
 He betrayed us Bonnie. The Stefan that we know is gone.
 Damon is...Damon.
 Jeremy, the minute that you get this call me!!
 Unbelievable!!
 It's not that I'm mad. I'm just-I'm worried.
 He is spiraling. Ever since Bonnie broke up with him, he is moody, he is not really talking to anyone.
 Who's seeing ghosts and has lost everyone that he cares about.
 You okay?
 Well, you're daydrunk. It's not exactly your most attractive look.
 Ah, ah- I'm not saying you have any attractive looks. I'm saying this is my least favorite one...
 Klaus.
 What more could you possibly want?
 That sounds like a Klaus and Stefan problem.
 Vampires, hybrids and originals. No problem. My rebellious brother. I'm worried.
 Just in time! We're cooking.
 Maybe because you got fired and you didn't tell anyone.
 Yeah, Jeremy! It matters. He was sired by Klaus. He's dangerous.
 What is with the attitude?
 Oh, no no! You're not going anywhere, especially not with Tyler.
 Jeremy...!
 This is weird. Klaus has hybrids stalking me and now you're just sitting in our kitchen.
 Unless you have to, you know, check in with your hybrid master.
 So you believe that serving Klaus is the right thing?
 Okay, so what if he asked you to rip your own heart out?
 What if he did?
 You're right Tyler I don't understand. Klaus has terrorized every single one of us and you're just blindly loyal to him.
 What was that about?
 So, Tyler Lockwood is a lunatic who has access to our house.
 Well, great, that's a wonderful influence for you Jer...
 Jeremy?
 Where did he go?
 Jeremy? What is he doing??
 Oh my god! Jeremy!!
 Jeremy move!!!!
 He's gonna be alright. Are you all right?
 Who was that on the phone earlier?
 You were compelled, Jeremy! We've gotta get him inside- help me!!
 He's dead, but he had his ring. Klaus's hybrid hit him. Now we just wait.
 It was Tyler! It had to have been. That's why he was hanging out with you. To get you off the vervain.
 Coffins?
 Hey, Jeremy calm down.
 He said he wants his family back.
 If we give him Rebekah...
 Klaus's coffins...How many did you say they were?
 Klaus is looking for four coffins, just like in your dream. Guessing it's not just stress?
 Klaus won't let me. Bonnie, he tried to kill Jeremy.
 We need to find Stefan. Look, I know that you don't think that your locator spell still works, but we have to at least try.
 The dead witches were angry at her for bringing Jeremy back to life. I guess now they have something they want her to know.
 Stefan?
 What?
 Then wait outside.
 I'm not leaving until I know if he's here.
 Stefan?
 Stefan, I need your help. Bonnie said that you would be here.
 Listen, you need to give Klaus his family back.
 Klaus compelled Jeremy to stand in front of speeding car. Don't you get it? Stefan, he's not gonna stop until he gets what he wants.
 Are you listening to me? He's gonna kill Jeremy!
 And you can go to hell!!
 Don't even start, Damon!
 You can't get in! The witches won't let you!
 Ric, hey! When did you return to the living?
 Hating me. Hating life. Hating the fact that we can't even have a family dinner without somebody dying before dessert. Are you okay?
 Oh my god!
 Ric, hey.
 He got hit by a car and...he's coughing up blood.
 What?
 No, no, no, wait. No wait! You have to help him!! What are you doing?
 No. Why are you doing this?
 Ric! Oh my god! I'm right here.
 Jeremy!
 Where are you going?
 What are you doing?
 Aahhh!
 Thank you for coming.
 I couldn't find him. But I have something else.
 You have Rebekah. A deal is a deal.
 You should know I was the one that daggered her. When she wakes she'll come after me.
 I told you I don't know where he is.
 He doesn't care about me anymore. You made sure of that. You turned him into a monster. Now he's your problem. And just so you know I'm not the only one that Rebekah wants dead. She knows what you did to your mother. She knows that you killed her. You can let yourself out.
 Did you get rid of him?
 What about Alaric?
 I think I got most of the blood off the porch.
 I have to tell you something. I made a deal with Klaus. I gave him Rebekah.
 No she won't. Klaus won't let her because he needs me.
 No I don't trust him. But what other choice do I have? I don't trust Stefan. Do you think he's just gonna give up the coffins?
 Yeah. My brother just chopped off someone's head! It's not right. It's not fair. He's sixteen years old. He shouldn't have to live like this.
 There has to be another way. We have to fix it.
 Hey. Can we talk?
 I've been thinking about what you said earlier. About how we should pack up and go...
 But you were right. You shouldn't have to give up a normal life- just because of me.
 I feel like a horrible person.
 I just can't stop thinking about what happened the last time I asked you to compel him.
 Thank you.
 Not just for this, Damon. For everything...I don't know what I would do if you weren't here.
 What?
 What? Damon, if he did it to protect you then...Why would he even do that? What is it even mean?
 What? What are you talking about? Guilty for what?
 Damon...
 Nothing to talk about.
 I didn't really sleep last night.
 Are you okay?
 Yeah, that's another reason why Jeremy has to get out of town. If those rings have a shelf life, he is not protected, neither are you.
 I'm just channeling frustration. I need coffee.
 Have you talked to Damon today?
 No reason.
 It's okay. I just got here too. Can you pass me the balloons? Thanks. What got you running late?
 Working out with Alaric. So, I have something I need to tell you, and you're not gonna like it.
 Jeremy is gonna be leaving town for a while. He'll be staying with some old family friends in Denver, until this whole Klaus thing blows over.
 I know...I asked Damon to compel him.
 I know, Bonnie. But it's not safe for him here anymore. Leaving will give him a better life. The only reason I'm telling you is because I know that you two haven't really worked out your stuff. And I thought that maybe you'd wanna say goodbye.
 Well you blew off school and missed our work of birthday art, so...
 Cake! Like when we were little.
 You're not stuck, Caroline.
 Okay, well I think I have another idea.
 There it is!
 No, Caroline was right...technically, she's dead. Sorry. But you don't need a birthday, you need a funeral. You need to say goodbye to your old life, so that you can move on with your new one.
 Cheerleader, Miss Mystic Falls, third grade hopscotch champion...
 She was 17, and she had a really good life. So rest in peace, so that she can move forward.
 That's what you really need. What we all really need. Amen, or cheers or whatever. Bonnie?
 Nice! Okay, make a wish.
 Ah-ah. I need it more than you do, trust me. Caroline, what are you doing?
 Okay, you're a bad sober liar. You're an even worse drunk liar.
 Caroline...
 Wow.
 I'm doing it to protect him, Bonnie. I want to give him a chance to have a quiet normal life.
 Bonnie, you can't tell him.
 
 Is that how you see it? That we're stuck?
 Bonnie is right, you know, I have no business messing in Jeremy's head. I just don't know what else to do. He is in danger here. I can't lose anyone else that I love.
 Great, we've been abandoned. Okay, we're going on a search party, I don't trust that she won't get back together with him.
 Come on, Caroline we don't have anymore drinks! Matt's being haunted by the Fell ghosts.
 What are you doing, Stefan?
 
 
 So, what's the plan, Stefan? What's the big move you're making?
 So, what are you gonna do, huh? Are you gonna lock me in some cave and keep me hostage?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What if he hadn't?
 
 After everything, that's what mattered? Destroying Klaus?
 You had me!
 Is that what you're doing? Trying to make me hate you?
 Thanks for picking me up.
 I'll survive. Somehow, I always do.
 Well, his method sucked.
 Don't sound so impressed.
 You can't kiss me again.
 I can't. It's not right.
 Good night, Damon.
 Be safe, okay?
 Thanks for coming. I was just thinking about what you said, about us being stuck.
 I do feel stuck, Matt. I feel like, I've been holding on to the girl that was supposed to die here with her parents. The girl who had a normal life, and didn't fall in love with vampires.
 Is it? 'Cause I feel like I disappointed her a little like, like I disappointed them. My parents.
 I just can't believe that you guys kept this from me this whole time.
 So, these are the rest of his family?
 So what are you gonna do, Stefan? Are you gonna kidnap me, so that I won't tell anyone?
 Oh my god, Bonnie.
 Los Alamitos?
 Honolulu?
 A lot. I asked the sheriff's office to pull up every single Abby Bennett in the country.
 There's nothing more important, Bonnie.
 You know, you don't have to, right? Let Stefan obsess over opening up the coffin. It doesn't have to fall on you.
 Yea-No.
 You're not coming, Damon.
 Okay, Damon. Look. Bonnie hasn't seen her mom in over fifteen years. We don't need your snarky commentary narrating the experience.
 You don't really talk about her.
 I'm not talking about it. He kissed me. It's not gonna happen again.
 It doesn't matter.
 Ignore him. Bonnie, your about to see your mom for the first time in 15 years. I'm not letting anyone ruin that moment.
 Fine.
 What?
 Bonnie and I are gonna spend the night at the lake house, while we wait for Sheriff Forbes to give us new addresses.
 No, Stefan, I'm not. We need a night off from your insanity.
 Well, we're doing everything we can. So, could you maybe not call every five minutes?
 Cute house.
 You ready?
 Hey, we're looking for, um, Abby Wilson.
 Oh, good.
 How are you holding up?
 You have a really beautiful home.
 You knew my mom?
 Mikael. He was an Original vampire.
 Bonnie...
 I'll wait outside.
 Honestly, I didn't care.
 Yeah, because now you can't do whatever you want.
 Hey, Jamie, go back inside, okay? Please, trust me, it's better off for you there.
 I don't think you've realized how bad you've gotten!
 Oh, yeah, right. Out-villain the villain. I get it.
 Jamie, what are you doing?
 Why are you doing this?
 Jamie, let me go. Jamie, he needs help!
 Bonnie?
 Bonnie!
 I've almost got it.
 Jamie, please, just let us go.
 Okay, I won't. Who gave you that gun?
 What else did he say?
 What about me? What did he say about me?
 Are you sure? Because these ropes are so tight, that it is hurting me.
 What can I do to help?
 I'm just trying to help!
 Keep screaming, maybe I'll feel sorry for you.
 You're not the only one, who changed, Stefan. We all had to.
 There's something I have to tell you. And it's not because I feel guilty, that it happened. It's because I feel guilty, that you don't know.
 I kissed Damon.
 There. All done.
 Stefan...say something. Please?
 Thank you.
 I know. I just...I wanted to give Bonnie a moment with her mother...without everything else getting in the way.
 I didn't plan on kissing him.
 Oh. Umm, hey, umm, sorry.
 Please, it's okay.
 The minute that you slept on that couch it became your place too. We needed you and...you stayed. So thank you for that. Hey, look, I know it's hard. But Jenna's gone. And you're allowed to move on.
 Morning.
 They're in the vitamins.
 You're hungover.
 I told you you don't have to feel guilty about inviting Meredith over here.
 No you didn't.
 Oh, was she cool about it?
 Sheriff Forbes, hi. Is everything okay?
 What?
 She doesn't think that I did it. She's just trying to find out why somebody used one of my family weapons to kill a council member.
 It wasn't Meredith.
 It's not Meredith! Okay? I refuse to believe that your luck with women is that tragic.
 What if it was Stefan? He was crazy that night. And you know he was trying to get underneath Klaus's skin, he was capable of pretty much anything.
 Bonnie told me that you guys would be here. I need to talk to you.
 Did you kill the medical examiner?
 Maybe because I don't know what you're capable of anymore.
 I don't want to believe any of it, Stefan.
 Stefan...
 That was fast.
 He's my family. I have to look out for him.
 What?
 Hear what?
 Oh my god.
 Caroline...He has vampire blood in his system.
 I called your mom.
 Mr. Forbes, did you see your attacker?
 You have to. You died with vampire blood in your system. If you don't feed and finish the transition into a vampire then you'll die.
 What are you doing?
 You mean, did I steal evidence from a crime scene? Yes.
 That doesn't mean she stole it.
 Identical to the one that killed Brian Walters.
 Well, she was trying to save Bill Forbes, why would she turn around and try to kill him?
 So what should we do?
 I'm sorry, Ric. Please be careful.
 Did you hear back from Tyler yet?
 He doesn't know what to think.
 I wish the girl Alaric liked wasn't in the middle of all of this. He deserves to be happy. But yeah, she looks guilty. It's why I told your mom.
 What?
 No....no, I don't think Tyler did it.
 Hey....he doesn't want to, Caroline. The only thing your dad has is his choice.
 Of course you do, he's your dad.
 Realizing all the things that he wouldn't be there for. The things that...that you just need your Dad for, you know?
 Thanks for walking me home.
 We've all lost a lot.
 That's weird.
 Here.
 I think I have some candles over there.
 Oh my God!
 Matt?
 Ric! Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
 Ric, look at me. Who did this to you?
 Oh my God, there's a lot of blood, Matt!
 What?
 Wait, wait, wait, Matt, hang up, hang up. He's right. If he dies a supernatural death, then he'll come back to life and he'll be healed.
 That's what he's saying, we don't but...I'm the doppelgänger.
 That makes me supernatural.
 He's dying, Matt!
 Caroline called. Her dad died. Will you stay with me? Until he wakes up?
 I can't lose any more family.
 She has an alibi?
 Then who could it be?
 Resigned to spending the night in observation, so long as I promise to change the lock on the house.
 So I talked to Bonnie earlier. She and her mom are fine. Have you talked to Caroline?
 No, Sheriff Forbes said there's no real suspects at all.
 How are you dealing with everything? I mean, you keep getting dragged into all of this.
 Thank you, for everything today. Really.
 Thanks.
 What?
 Rebekah.
 It was their mother Esther who was sealed in that coffin.
 I don't know. I'm guessing she has a couple connections in the witching community. Elijah said that she wants to live in peace with her family, including Klaus.
 Well, not anymore...at least not according to Elijah.
 Look, Elijah promised me that his family wouldn't hurt any of us.
 I believe him.
 It's an invitation. "Please join the Mikaelson Family, this evening at seven o'clock. For dancing, cocktails and celebration."
 The Original Family.
 Wait, there's a note on the back. "Elena, I think it's time that we finally meet, Esther."
 If Esther wants to talk to me, maybe I should find out why.
 Stefan has a point, Damon. I should find out what she wants.
 Hey!
 It's all so weird. The Originals are throwing a ball. Like an actual ball.
 I have no idea. There's only one way to find out.
 I did, which is all the more reason why I need a drama free bodyguard.
 Uhh, I can't deal with either of the Salvatores right now. Whatever Stefan is feeling, he is channeling it all against Klaus. And Damon...it's just not a good idea.
 I was gonna tell you. Just, after everything happened with your dad....
 I'm sorry. It's just I, I don't even know how I feel about it yet. All I do know is that it just used to be so much easier.
 What are you doing here? I know your mom's rules. No hurting the locals.
 Probably to get this reaction from us.
 What are you doing here?
 Well, I am. And I'm not leaving until I find out what Esther wants. So, shall we?
 Is she here?
 They're protecting me. You may not know but your mother's already tried to kill me once.
 She wants to see me alone, Damon.
 I was invited.
 Why so that you can stop me?
 It is tradition.
 Thank you.
 Hmm. He dances, and I didn't even have to beg.
 He's just looking out for me.
 I need to talk to you.
 Not here.
 If Esther is secretly on our side, we need to know. But I can't get to her with two bodyguards.
 Because Damon won't let me anywhere near her without protection. And you care about killing Klaus more than you care about anything, so...
 What? Am I wrong?
 Make sure that I can get into that room with Esther. Alone.
 I can do this.
 When we were together you used to let me make my own decisions. You trusted me. After all this at least that hasn't changed.
 Uh, yeah. Why, is something wrong?
 Do you think that it's an act?
 Of course. I'll find you later, okay?
 How are you alive? Are you a ghost? Or...
 So that's why only Bonnie and her mother could open up the casket.
 So you've been on the other side for a thousand years?
 You're gonna help us kill Klaus, aren't you?
 She said you did it to protect them from the werewolves.
 How are you gonna kill him? He's immortal.
 What do I have to do with it?
 What do you mean "linked as one"?
 What?
 Intense.
 She just wanted to apologize for trying to have me killed.
 It's true.
 Actually, yes.
 Uh no, Damon let go of me. Look, I'm sorry that I had to cut you out of the plan.
 Do you think I like going behind your back? I don't. But if I hadn't asked Stefan to help, then you would've tried to be the hero, and it would've ruined everything.
 Now you're mad at me for including Stefan?
 Well, maybe that's the problem. 
 Yeah. And I got to look Elijah right in the eye and lie to him about it.
 I just signed their death sentences, Stefan.
 It's not that simple.
 I'll call him and let him know.
 Damon being self-destructive. I said something I didn't mean.
 Stefan. Did you really not feel anything?
 How do you do that? Act like you don't care, like you don't feel anything? Because I can't do that. I...I feel. I feel everything.
 I'm not going to stop, Stefan, because I don't believe that you feel nothing.
 Then show it! Do something, Stefan, anything is better than trying to convince me that you don't care.
 Stefan.
 Stefan, hey, umm...it's me. I really have to talk to you. Please call me back.
 Hey, I- I called you ten times last night. We need to talk.
 If you're mad at me, Damon, you need to get over it.
 Did you stop taking your vervain?
 What's wrong with you? She tried to kill me less than forty eight hours ago.
 So is that how it's going to be now? I hurt your feelings and this is how you lash out at me?
 You should know that Esther is planning on killing her entire family. She's linked them all together with a spell. Whatever happens to one, happens to all of them.
 Uh, because to kill Klaus she has to kill all of them, including Elijah. And he doesn't deserve this!
 Shouldn't you at least care about Rebekah.
 Why are you doing this?
 He was gloating. Like actual gloat. Like he was proud of himself for sleeping with her. Is it working?
 When Esther did it, she kept the sage burning. There was a lot more smoke.
 And all this time you let me vent about Damon?
 Okay, well, what did she want?
 Okay, well, is there a way to stop her from channeling you?
 I just keep thinking....Before the sun and the moon ritual, Elijah found a way to keep me alive. And now I'm in exactly the same position and I'm just gonna let him die? It just doesn't feel right.
 What?
 Elijah.
 I can't even imagine what it must have been like a thousand years ago.
 That's incredible.
 Do you know this place too?
 Elijah, I should probably go home.
 That's not true. I told you that all your mother wanted was a new start.
 I never wanted this to happen.
 We were told that whatever was going to be in that coffin was going to kill Klaus. When we found out that it was your mother....We didn't know what to think.
 When she asked to see me, I...I thought that maybe she could help. That she would find a way to kill Klaus. It's not just Klaus that she wants to kill.
 I'm so sorry, Elijah. I wish there was something I could do to help.
 What are you doing here?
 What are you doing?
 I guess you think I had this coming, huh? After what I did to you?
 This isn't my fault. I wanted to get rid of Klaus. At one point, so did you. I didn't know that your mom was planning on killing all of you.
 Sorry. No vampires allowed.
 What are you doing?
 Are you insane?
 I don't know, you tell me. You're the one whose mother's trying to kill you.
 You're still wearing her necklace.
 She's not doing this because she hates you, Rebekah. She told me that she...she just doesn't have another choice.
 You're not gonna do it.
 Because there's still a chance that you might be alive tomorrow. And if that's the case and you kill me now, you'll have used up all of your revenge. Wasted it and isn't that what you want? Revenge? Because I- I pretended to like you and then I stuck a dagger in your back. I mean, that's why you slept with Damon, isn't it? That's why you're tormenting me, because I hurt your feelings.
 I never said I was tough. But we both know that I'm right.
 How did they do that?
 What?
 Please, just let me talk to her.
 She's always been there for me, Caroline. Please. Let me just be there for her too.
 You know, you're right. I just...just tell her that I love her, okay?
 If you can't keep up.
 What did she say?
 She decided to become a vampire?
 Did Bonnie say-is there anything I can do?
 Damon turned her mom into a vampire to save my life. It's absolutely my fault.
 Sheriff Forbes, is everything okay? He what?
 Were you just..?
 But you're not going to. Are you?
 Your friend's in jail for murder. You have to do something.
 Stop it, Damon!
 You know, you could show a little compassion about Bonnie.
 Okay, now you're just being mean.
 You know if you keep pushing people away, you're gonna end up alone.
 I don't have to make a case, he didn't do anything.
 I know enough.
 Okay, you're making all of this up.
 How could you do this to him? He didn't kill anyone and you know it.
 Wow, nice job.
 Okay, look, I don't know how much longer Meredith is gonna be in surgery, so let's see what we can find.
 Yeah, I'm looking for the evidence that she didn't hand over.
 I know him, Matt. He's innocent. And I know that Meredith's a Fell, founding family.
 Which means...
 Skeletons in the closet. Just like a true founder.
 Brian Walters. Bill Forbes.
 She's got everything on him  medical records, old court documents.
 It's an old Gilbert journal.
 I...
 Yeah, why?
 I know that we had no right.
 But, we found something that clears Alaric. It gives him an alibi in the Brian Walters murder.
 What is that?
 I'm sorry.
 What are you doing?
 Stefan?
 What are you two doing?
 Just say it.
 I know it doesn't make sense, but at the beginning, after my parents died, there was something about being with Stefan that just felt safe.
 I know, believe me, just saying it out loud it sounds crazy, but it's like I knew that he would never stop loving me. Like he would never...
 Die. Like he would never die.
 Damon just sort of snuck up on me. He got under my skin and no matter what I do I just...I can't shake him.
 I'm sorry. This...this is weird. Talking about them with you.
 The journal?
 Are you okay?
 I'm good. Gonna head to bed in a few.
 If not for you, for who?
 Okay, well, how about we just agree to take care of each other then?
 Old family journal.
 It's hard to tell. I mean, at first I thought it was Johnathan Gilbert's journal, but it ended up being his granddaughter's, who apparently went just as crazy as he did. So, great genes, huh?
 Good night, Ric.
 Ric, I think she's right.
 What are you looking for?
 And if it's not?
 When did you suspect him? That it was Alaric who was killing all of those people?
 But then, why did you protect him?
 Meredith says that everything is normal.
 Look, I'm gonna call Bonnie, the rings were made by a Bennett witch so maybe a witch can reverse the damage.
 What is wrong with you? How could you just go out feeding with Stefan like some vampire pub crawl?
 You stood there and let him feed on an innocent girl.
 Why would you do that?
 Well, Stefan found a way around it before.
 He was able to manage when he was drinking my blood. Small amounts every single day.
 I'm just saying, maybe you're not the right person to be teaching Stefan about self-control.
 Hi.
 I'm sorry, Damon told Alaric that there was no one home, otherwise I would have....
 I just came by to pick up this book that you found, on my ancestor, Samantha.
 How are you doing? Damon said that you were...
 Yeah. Well, if there's anything I can do to help.
 Okay, well, I'm gonna let you get back to...whatever it was you were doing.
 Bonnie's not returning any of my calls.
 I know and I get it but, something really terrible has happened to Ric and...and I really need her help.
 No, no, no. Don't even think like that.
 We're all gonna be fine.
 Caroline?
 Thank you so much.
 Okay, yeah, I- I'll get it. Bonnie, I'm so sorry for everything, thank you for doing this.
 Bonnie thinks that she can help you with a spell.
 But she needs something that you wore before you put on the ring. Something personal.
 Okay, yeah, uh- that's a...that's a good idea.
 Okay.
 You made yourself perfectly clear this morning, Stefan. You don't want to be around me.
 So then, what are you doing here?
 So, she was a psychopath. I get it.
 Wait, so, your saying that the violent behavior can still happen even if the person isn't wearing the ring?
 I'm not gonna do anything, Stefan. I'm gonna keep looking until we find something that'll help him.
 It's my family's ring that's doing this to him. It's my responsibility to fix it.
 Are we talking about Alaric here or are we talking about you? Because I wasn't planning on giving up on either of you.
 What is that?
 "Jeremy, if anything happens to me, carry on my work. You have the other ring, let the ring make you strong. The council must be cleansed before the work can begin."
 No, Alaric didn't write this.
 I have to get back.
 Hi. Where's Meredith?
 What happened?
 No.
 I couldn't find it.
 Don't hurt him!
 Why?
 Meredith. Hey.
 You're gonna be okay.
 Yeah, I'm fine.
 How is she doing?
 I'm sorry, Bonnie, I - I didn't – I didn't want this to happen. If there was anything that I could do to make it different, I...
 Please say that you forgive me.
 Hey stranger.
 Do you need checking up on?
 Hey, have you talked to Alaric lately?
 Yeah, everything's fine – um- I just wanted to hear your voice.
 Yeah – um- of course, Jer. Go out, go have fun, and um- I – I just miss you.
 Hey, how's Alaric?
 So then, does that mean there were no issues last night?
 Then why do I feel like you're hiding something from me?
 They're not for you.
 Just take it and give it to him and tell him that I miss him, okay?
 Please.
 Dam...
 I can't expect you to be okay with this. But at least these herbs that Bonnie's giving him, they're healing him and they're keeping the dark side buried.
 No, Caroline, it's not okay. It's horrible and I feel horrible about it, but he's a victim of something supernatural, he didn't ask for this, it just happened to him. Just like Bonnie's mom, I mean, she didn't ask to become a vampire. And neither did Stefan or Tyler.
 Or you. None of you asked for this, but who would I be if I just turned my back on any of you?
 I don't know. Stefan just said to meet here.
 Hang on. White oak? You have a weapon that can kill Klaus?
 Okay.
 Don't worry about me. Not after what happened to Bonnie's mom.
 Bonnie, we're starting to worry about you. Call me back or call Caroline. Just call someone, please.
 Is it weird that Bonnie's not returning my calls?
 That's Finn. I thought he left town.
 Hey. Where are you?
 Klaus' brother, Finn is in the town square and he's with some ex-girlfriend or something.
 We have an opportunity. So how do we do this?
 Then get Damon and get down here.
 Stefan?
 Hey. How is he?
 Wait, wait, Rebekah has Damon; our next move should be finding him.
 Yeah, that was the plan before Damon's life was hanging in the balance.
 Yeah, and if the roles were reversed he would stop everything to save you.
 What he would want and what we should do are two different things.
 Then hurry up and - and tell me what to do.
 Damon. Come on, come on, we have to keep going. Damon.
 No. Look at me. Look at me.
 I am not going to leave you. Damon? No. 
 Hey. How's Alaric?
 Bonnie. Where have you been?
 Klaus should be dead. They should all be dead, we just killed Finn.
 Okay, Bonnie, where's Damon?
 Are – are you okay?
 No, Bonnie just....
 Stefan, stop. Klaus is stronger than you, we need another plan.
 Stefan, stop it! You're acting on anger!
 Or it'll get you killed! It'll get Damon killed along with you.
 She just died!
 But why? Were they bitten by a hybrid or..?
 No, that doesn't explain Troy.
 If the Originals die, so do all of you. The entire vampire species would...it'd just be dead.
 Trading the stakes for Damon.
 No, not all of them. We still have uh- enough to kill three out of the four of them. If we can figure out who to save.
 I have no idea. You were turned with Damon's blood, and Damon and Stefan were turned by Katherine, and we know that Katherine was turned by a vampire named Rose.
 We don't know. But it can only link back to one Original and if the odds are in our favor, hopefully it won't be Klaus. So that we can still kill him.
 Oh my God. Tyler. If we kill Klaus, then Tyler will die.
 Hey.
 You haven't said much since you got back home.
 You really scared me today. You wouldn't have survived if you went up against Klaus on your own, you know that, right?
 Why?
 That's not true. Yeah, Klaus dragged you through hell, but you came out the other side. You beat him by being better than him.
 Stefan.
 I...I can't, because it's not true, Stefan. I never stopped loving you.
 What are you talking about?
 What? No, Stefan, I...
 I- I don't know what I feel.
 Alaric?
 Well, you still need the basics. Toothbrush, clothes, some boring books to help you sleep.
 What? No, I grabbed....Damon. 
 Are you sure that you...? I mean you don't have to be kept in here.
 We looked everywhere. You....the other you, hid it well.
 It's the only thing that will kill him, so wage war, murder people, you know Klaus stuff.
 Listen, Stefan is gonna watch over you for a little while. Now that Klaus knows where Jeremy is, it's not safe so, Damon and I are gonna go to Denver to pick him up.
 I don't know. Me and Damon. Traveling across the country.
 Actually, it was his idea. He thinks that I have some unresolved feelings for Damon.
 I guess that's why I'm going on this trip. So I can figure it out.
 Who did you have to compel for that?
 Stefan...
 There he is.
 Hey Jer!
 Rose spent a long time running from Klaus as well. She and Damon were close, so maybe we can use him as a connection.
 Jer...
 Damon, it's Kol!
 Jeremy, get back! He's an Original.
 Not helping.
 Well, this should work, right Jer?
 Something that matters, Damon.
 I was with her on her last day and she definitely wasn't in paradise.
 Is she lonely on the other side?
 What do you mean? Nothing's up.
 What did she say?
 Yeah. It's fine.
 You never told me about that. What you did for Rose.
 Why don't you let people see the good in you?
 Don't.
 Oh my God, Jeremy. I...
 
 Who is this Mary person?
 And how do you know her?
 Of course.
 And were you her favorite?
 Are you okay?
 Yeah. I'll be fine.
 What do you mean?
 Stefan thinks that I have feelings for you.
 I- I don't – I don't know.
 No.
 Damon...
 It's what you do, Damon. You sabotage things, you...I mean, think about it, every time there's a bump in the road, you lash out.
 I just...I wish there was something I could do.
 Where do you want me to hang this thing?
 Yeah I asked Matt to help Jeremy readjust. He got him his old job back at the Grill.
 Jeremy has got a lot on his mind. The whole thing with Alaric has got him really stressed out.
 I didn't tell you that so you could torture me with it.
 What do you mean? I thought you, Bonnie, and I were going as girl dates.
 What?
 Hmm.
 I can't ask him on a date, I just made out with his brother.
 Yeah, but-
 Yeah and you're not biased or anything.
 Hey...do you, do you have a second?
 Yeah. Yeah, I just, um...I wanted to, uh...Caroline and I were talking about going to the dance and, um...Okay look, I know where we're at, you and I, and I know it would be stupid to even think that we could go back to the way things were, but I'm going to the dance and I'd like to go with you.
 Okay, great. Bye.
 Wow, you look very dapper.
 Thank you.
 Getting out of bed is dangeous these days. But we have to live our lives.
 Some guy I used to date said it once or twice.
 Shall we?
 Teach me some moves.
 Nice try!
 She's working on it.
 Yeah, you should, although I wouldn't expect her to forgive you. Or Damon.
 Listen, Stefan, about Damon...We should probably talk about the trip to Denver.
 How can you be so fair about this?
 If Alaric is sick then we need to find a cure. Something.
 So wait, what are you suggesting we do?
 What?!
 Jeremy...
 Jer, stop...
 No one is gonna hurt him.
 Hey. Hey...Look at me. I promise.
 Jeremy go inside and get Stefan and Damon, now!
 Just please don't hurt Alaric.
 Ric!
 What's going on? What are you doing with him?
 Remake him?
 You can't create another Original. What if he turns out to be an even bigger monster than your children?
 You don't know that, you don't know anything about him.
 Ric, this isn't what you want. It's not who you are.
 You don't mean that.
 No Ric, please don't. Don't do this. I won't help you, I'm not gonna give you my blood, you're gonna have to kill me!
 No Ric please, don't.. No!
 No!
 You said you wanted to undo the evil that you created, but this...This is just as evil!
 How, if he's immortal?
 Yeah, but you'll be killing the good along with the bad, you're no better than Klaus!
 Don't you dare use Jenna as an excuse for what you've done.
 Jeremy!
 Esther stop it!
 Hey, wait, Jer...Alaric this isn't your fault.
 This is all my fault. You moved out, you gave me your ring back, you didn't want any part of this and I, I forced you to stay and take care of us.
 No, I'd rather get it over with now before some janitor comes to clean out Alaric's stuff and realizes the history teacher was a vampire slayer.
 I can't Stefan, okay? I can't think about the fact that Jeremy and I don't have anyone to take care of us any more or that we've lost another friend, I just, I can't think about any of it.
 I'm not done!
 Who gave you that horrible advice?
 I don't have anyone any more.
 It's the only color we had.
 We have to keep moving. Otherwise we'll start thinking and we don't want to think.
 What? No, Jer, we're just...
 He didn't mean that.
 Whoever this is, it's not funny.
 Ric?
 Caroline. 
 You said that you would let her go!
 Alaric stop!
 Why are you doing this?
 What?! No!
 This isn't what I want.
 Why are you doing this?
 Look at you. How is this right?!
 You don't know anything about them.
 You did.
 Get help!
 So then, why am I still alive? There's obviously no humanity left in you, so what's stopping you, Alaric? If you want me dead then kill me.
 Do it! Kill me!
 Stop!
 Let him go or I'll kill myself.
 Why? Because you still need me alive? There's a reason why Esther used me to make you, isn't there? She didn't want you to be immortal, so she tied your life to a human one. Mine. That way you have only one life span to kill all vampires and then you'll be gone. So, when I die, you die too. That's it, it has to be!
 Am I?
 What are you doing?
 Tyler, help me!
 Tyler, please. Get Stefan, please.
 So, that's it? You're just gonna bleed me dry.
 What about your hybrids? You'll need more than this to create your army.
 If you believe that, then why take my blood at all? You want a backup family. You know that your siblings will never trust you again.
 Rot in hell.
 What are you doing?
 Tyler.
 Huh, you two are really gonna walk me all the way to the door, aren't you?
 Yeah, I know, but I told you I'm fine, I just – I have a little headache.
 Yeah, but he can't hurt me. It's you two that we should be worrying about.
 I know it's selfish.
 I – I know that it seems like I'm stringing you both along. But I don't – I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I mean, if I choose one of you then I lose the other and I've lost so many people. I just – I can't bear the thought of losing one of you.
 Just...be careful. Both of you.
 What are you guys doing here?
 What victory? We failed. Alaric's still out there.
 I know.
 Thank you for standing up to Klaus like that.
 I do not condone this, by the way.
 Okay.
 
 And to all of you. My family.
 It's just us.
 Me too. Mom and Dad were right. Alaric should just kill all the vampires and put an end to all of this. But then that means that Caroline dies and Bonnie loses her mom, the Mayor loses her son, and I lose Stefan and Damon. So, if it makes me the bad guy for wanting to keep those people alive, then fine, I'll be the bad guy.
 Good night.
 Jeremy locked himself in the bathroom again. Does he think we don't know what he's doing in there?
 Morning, mom.
 I'm fine. I just...I want something to eat first.
 Uhh, I told you I'm fine.
 No, it's-it's nice.
 Caroline Forbes told me that my ponytail lacked 'zhuzh'.
 That doesn't make you psychic, Bonnie. It means that you watch too much Top Model.
 It doesn't matter because I can't go.
 I know, but Jenna's in town and my parents want to do family night.
 What?
 Where is everyone?
 Sophomore year.
 It was. I'm sorry that I strung you along. I should have figured out what I wanted and just been honest about it. I'm now making the same mistakes with Stefan and Damon. It's not right what I'm doing to them either, I – I have to let one of them go.
 Stefan.
 I'm being over coddled. I feel completely fine.
 And do what? Go on the run for the rest of my life? No thank you. 
 Stefan.
 We've finally stopped him, Elijah. After everything that he's done to us, I can't just let you bring him back.
 Why do you want Klaus' body?
 
 Stefan, make sure that Alaric doesn't lay a hand on Jeremy.
 Lately, I feel like every time someone walks out of this house, there's a chance they may not make it back home.
 Stefan.
 
 Mm, thank you.
 He saved my life, you know. I never told you that. The night that my parents' car went off the bridge, Stefan was the one that saved me.
 No, it's not that. It's – after the accident, I kind of felt like I didn't know how to live anymore, like I didn't want to, but then being with Stefan...it just...somehow I figured it out. And that's what love should be. You should love the person that makes you glad that you're alive.
 The problem's Damon. When I'm with him, he just consumes me. And I know that I can't love them both, I know that it's wrong, but I – when I choose one then I'll lose the other. And I don't want to lose anyone else. I – I just – I wish that I had my mom here to give me some advice.
 Hey, it's me.
 Listen, do you think someone could come pick me up?
 Matt and I got into a fight. He was talking about college and marriage and all the stuff that he always talks about and I just, I couldn't.
 I don't know how I feel.
 Yeah, but I don't want to lose him.
 What's going on?
 The tea. You drugged me?
 What the hell is going on, Matt?
 We have to go back. Listen to me, Matt, if Klaus is the one that turned their bloodline, then they're all gonna die. 
 What?!
 What?
 How are you feeling? Are there any symptoms?
 Yeah, I'm – I'm sure we will.
 Matt's taking me home.
 Not just to Stefan, Damon. To Tyler, to Caroline.
 Yeah, of course.
 I love him, Damon. He came into my life at a time when I needed someone and I fell for him instantly. No matter what I feel for you, I – I never unfell for him.
 I can't think about always. All I can think about is right now. And I care about you, Damon, which is why I have to let you go. I mean, maybe if you and I had met first.
 
 You too, Care.
 It's Tyler, he um...he's...
 Matt, Matt! No. Stop it.
 I need to call Stefan, but my phone is dying.
 Thanks. 
 Dad?! Dad!
 Dad!
 I know Bonnie, you're right. You and my mom both are. I just can't bring myself to tell him. At least not tonight. I'll call you later.
 No – um – I 
 Not to be rude or anything, Damon, but it's kind of creepy that you're out here in the middle of nowhere.
 It's Mystic Falls. Nothing bad ever happens here.
 Got into a fight with my boyfriend.
 Life, future, he's got it all mapped out.
 I don't know what I want.
 What, mysterious stranger who has all the answers?
 So, Damon, tell me. What is it that I want?
 So, what do you want?
 It's my parents.
 Stefan?
 Wh-what happened?
 Oh my God. Matt is he...?
 Thank you. I thought that I – how did you...?
 Oh my God. Does - does that mean that I – am I dead?
 No, no, no, no! That wasn't supposed to happen!
 
 Jer!
 I'm fine. I'm not Vicki.
 
 Yeah, but the consequences were horrible.
 We're gonna find a way out of this. Everything's gonna be okay.
 
 Yeah, I'm gonna puke.
 I never thought I'd be saying this, but I can't stop thinking about blood.
 No, if you had saved me, then Matt would be dead. What do you think I'd be going through then?
 Stefan, listen to me. You did the right thing. You did what you always do; you respected my choice.
 Well then, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
 Oh my God, did - did I just say "cross that bridge"?
 
 I'm sorry. I...
 I thought you left?
 I'm tired, Damon.
 I thought that was gone. Thank you.
 Why do you have to say it with my necklace?
 Damon, don't go there.
 Stefan?
 Why did you bring me here?
 Where's Stefan?
 He would never hurt me. You have no idea what you're talking about.
 No.
 Yeah.
 No, I've got to get out of here.
 Where am I?
 Where's Stefan?
 Stefan.
 I didn't feed.
 Stefan. Stefan, something's happening.
 Stefan.
 I'm out of time. I need blood. I'm dying.
 Stop!
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm here. I'm okay.
 Don't be. You had hope. That's all I ever wanted you to have and you had it.
 Do you know why I was even on that bridge? I was coming back for you, Stefan. I had to choose and I picked you.
 Because I love you. No matter what happens, it's the best choice I ever made.
 God. It sucks that I can't see you right now.
 Me too.
 Leave him alone!
 You were gonna kill him.
 It was my choice to save him. Why aren't you seeing that?
 I remember everything.
 One of the highlights of my transition  remembering everything that you compelled me to forget.
 Like how you and I met first. You were a stranger that told me you wanted me to get everything I wanted from life. Damon, why didn't you tell me?
 You asked me to make a choice, Damon. So I did. If you're gonna be mad, then take it out on me. Not on Stefan or Matt or anyone else. Me.
 If it had been you at the bridge last night and not Stefan and I begged you to save Matt....?
 That's what I thought. And then Matt would be dead, because you couldn't let go. Matt would be dead!
 The whole Council knows who we are now. Everything's about to change.
 You don't have to convince me that everything is gonna be okay.
 But I'll get to live. 
 I'm gonna get through this. Just like we get through everything  one day at a time. We should get inside before sunrise.
 Daylight ring?
 Hi.
 Woah, what's going on?
 You're still not on board with the animal plan.
 
 Yeah, but I was a cheerleader. I sucked at track.
 I can't. All I can think about is your hands on my body.
 No, no, no. I - I didn't say to take them off. It feels good.
 It feels like you're touching every nerve on my body.
 Hey, Care, it's me. I'm back, I um- can you call me? I've been having some 
 Hey.
 What's that for?
 Celebrate what?
 Well, um, I wouldn't say I survived it. It actually kind of made me sick.
 You're so cheery.
 Okay.
 Oh my gosh.
 Did you do it?
 But there's no one here.
 Did you set off the explosion that killed the Town Council?
 Did you?
 Yes, something's wrong. I can't keep any of the animal blood down.
 I think I need your help.
 No. No, no human blood. Stefan's right, I have to at least try to get through this without hurting anyone.
 What are you doing?
 What?
 Why not?
 What do you mean it's personal?
 I'm fine. It's just my emotions are all over the place. Everything's heightened. I mean 
 People died. People we've known our whole lives, so yeah, I did.
 Is that?
 Oh, wow.
 Hey there.
 My parent's funeral.
 Are you gonna survive this?
 You say what you want to say or you don't say anything at all. And don't worry about your dad, everyone in this town loved him.
 Even still.
 I'm sorry, I...I have to go.
 I'm in the basement bathroom.
 Is that you at the door?
 Sorry, there's someone in here! 
 Oh, Damon, thank God.
 Sorry, I – I spilt coffee all over my dress.
 Yeah, just a minute!
 
 Did you bring the blood bag?
 No, I can't. It tastes like....What's wrong with me?
 I'm dying, aren't I?
 No. No, I don't – I can't risk killing anyone, Damon. Maybe I'm better off dead.
 I have to get back inside.
 Where is she?
 I uh – when I talked to April earlier she was kind of nervous about coming up to speak. And now that I'm up here, I'm kind of nervous too.
 The worst day of loving someone is the day that you lose them.
 I um...
 The blood. Stefan, the blood, I can smell it. There's so much.
 Stefan, I'm losing it.
 Thank you.
 The blood. I can still smell it. It's got to be April. We have to help her.
 Then I'm gonna do it!
 What do we do?
 What about April?
 April!
 Let go of me!
 No, I – I can't, Caroline. You have to do it.
 No, I can't.
 April, listen to me.
 Everything's gonna be okay. You're gonna get through this. Just like I got through it.
 I'm going to help you. I promise.
 You watched the funeral from up here so that you could grieve alone. It was a beautiful service. People said really nice things.
 You're mad.
 I didn't lie. I just didn't tell you.
 You were just so happy that things were going well and – and...
 I just didn't want to ruin it for you.
 Yeah, because I thought that he would understand.
 Stefan, please.
 I didn't want to hurt you. I'm – I'm sorry – I – look I'm really, really sorry. Why am I crying?
 I'm so sick of crying!
 I feel like I've been crying since the day that my parents died. My life it's – it's like a never ending funeral. We keep burying people, Stefan. You want to know what's heightened? This grief, I can't stop feeling everyone's grief.
 All the hurt, I feel like it's trying to explode out of me.
 Where?
 This um – is for my mom, my dad, Jenna, everyone that you've all lost, everyone that this town has lost. And for me, I guess.
 Thank you for doing this. I can't keep anything else down.
 Yeah, but I didn't make Stefan save your life so that I could turn you into a human blood bag.
 
 Thank you.
 The vampire hunter knows that Damon's a vampire and that I know Damon. Hiding at home would be more suspicious. Besides, I want to be here. It's my senior year. I survived this long, there's no way I'm bailing before graduation.
 
 If only they knew the real story.
 First period, and I'm ready to bawl my eyes out.
 
 It's a pretty enormous hatchet.
 
 So, you left the only person on earth that actually likes you?
 I hate her.
 I didn't think I was capable of hate, but I hate her, and I hate that I hate her.
 That's the hunter.
 Jeremy. No.
 
 
 You shouldn't be here. This is my school. It's my life. And I'm not gonna let you ruin it!
 I don't want to go home. I want to take the white oak stake and kill her. That's how mad I am. She made me murderous!
 And-and then do what? Ignore her to death?
 Yeah. Okay, fine.
 Then, we'll go to her party and show her that she can't intimidate me. I just have to go home and change first.
 I need bourbon to get through Rebekah's party. Yours is better than Stefan's.
 
 You keep alcohol in your underwear drawer?
 What happened to you?
 
 Why were you talking to Jeremy?
 Damon, don't bring him into this.
 
 Or who died here.
 No, I'm just quietly hating.
 April's here. I'm gonna go say hi.
 
 Hey.
 I'm glad you came. 
 And now I'm giving you beer. Sounds about right.
 How are you doing with everything?
 So, you-you don't think that it was an accident?
 
 Did you blow up her dad's house to get revenge on the Council?
 My ring!
 Give it back!
 No!
 Yes. Reluctantly. 
 No. Not just yet.
 I never got a drink.
 
 No!
 Stefan. What's wrong with me?
 Oh my God.
 Why am I thinking about you?
 I already had this conversation with Jeremy. There's no way you guys could have known that I would go, I mean, I was surprised that I went.
 Stefan warned me that I would feel things more powerfully, but Matt, the hatred that I felt today? I almost–I almost killed her, in front of everyone, in the middle of a party. That's not me. At least, it didn't–it didn't used to be.
 Yeah, but it's not just about Rebekah, it's about my mind.
 I'm having these terrible thoughts  these violent images and I  it's all driven by one simple thing  this hunger.
 Oh my God. Matt, I'm sorry. I'm so-I'm so sorry. I didn't-I didn't mean to 
 What have I done?
 I know it's crazy but I almost killed Matt last night. Damon had to rip me off of him and then compel him to forget. Call it "Doppelgänger curse" or whatever, but I can't drink animal blood. I can't drink from a blood bag, I can only drink from the vein.
 That's why we're not using the wood ones for hunter defense class.
 She's too good. She doesn't understand how hard it is and you...well, I know what being around too much blood does to you, so...I can't put you through that.
 Don't be jealous. You know I wish it could be you.
 We're crashing Bonnie's trip to Whitmore College. The professor that took over her Grams' classes, he invited her. Listen to me. You are the one who's getting me through this, no matter who teaches me how to feed.
 I will. I promise.
 
 Something tells me that college isn't in my future anymore.
 Is that him?
 He's kind of...
 
 What if I am?
 Sorry.
 It's not a game, Damon.
 Hey!
 You're in my Anthro class, right?
 I totally spaced and forgot to get the reading list. Do you have it?
 This isn't going to hurt. Please don't scream.
 Who's that?
 Get out of here. Go back to class.
 I just...I saw the picture and I –
 I care because I'm still me. I still have the same feelings, Damon. Sorry if that spoils your master plan to turn me into a super vampire.
 
 I think I found one.
 Mhm.
 Oh.. I'm sorry...Drink? 
 Yea. 
 
 
 
 Don't scream. This isn't gonna hurt.
 Oh my God. Oh my God.
 
 Who am I? Why am I acting like this?
 I should be here with Stefan. I shouldn't be here with him. I should be going through all this with Stefan.
 Damon, I'm sorry. Things got a little heated at the party and I shouldn't have let that happen. It's just that I – I feel like.
 When you tell me what a vampire should be, deep down I believe you. I think that you're right and I – I hate that feeling. Because I don't want to be...
 Hey.
 Wait, what are you doing here?
 I learned how to feed without hurting someone. It was awful. You were right. I got caught up in it.
 But I don't want it to get easier. I can't live like this. Stefan, I'm feeling things that I don't – I don't want to feel and I'm becoming someone that I don't – I don't want to be. I don't think I'm gonna survive this.
 No.
 
 
 
 Excuse me? What are you doing?
 Okay, uh, good morning to you too.
 I haven't talked to him yet today.
 
 No, Damon. I didn't tell him that I got high on blood like some crackhead and then dirty danced with you. It was a mistake, okay? I wasn't myself and besides, he's already got enough to deal with trying to get me through this vampire stuff.
 I'm not in a shame spiral.
 I'm not in a shame spiral, Damon.
 Or something's wrong.
 Stefan!
 Damon's right. Connor's strong, but he's not going to be able to take all of us.
 He's got Jeremy. I'm going.
 Does he?
 Who was he talking to?
 What is that?
 The tunnels, like the ones in the Lockwood cellar.
 What did you find out?
 What?!
 We have to get them out of there.
 I'm going in these tunnels.
 Well, maybe that's it. I can offer to trade myself in exchange for the hostages.
 Stop treating me like I can't handle myself. Alaric trained me and I've been practicing with Stefan.
 Head shots no good, it has to be the heart. So, now you're dead.
 My brother is the only thing that's holding me together right now, Damon. If anything happens to him...
 Will it? I mean, haven't we already been here before with Jeremy? Isn't this why we sent him to Denver?
 Okay, what is with you two? We're wasting time.
 Stefan!
 Why are you doing this?
 If you can't count on him? You just vervained him.
 Then I'm coming with you.
 You need my help, Stefan.
 You don't think that I – I- I'm afraid of that? Of course, I am. Stefan, I'm barely holding it together. If Jeremy gets hurt....
 No.
 Stefan, call me! There was an explosion at the Grill. I need to know what's happening!
 Damon, hey. Can you get up?
 He took your ring? Why would he do that?!
 Then I need to get in there.
 So am I, Damon!
 Please!
 Don't hurt him.
 He's the only family that I have left. Just – just let him go.
 Jeremy?!
 I'm sorry – I....
 How did this happen, Jer? Why did Connor come after you?
 His what?
 
 I think I know who.
 Stay the hell away from my brother!
 You missed.
 I need to bury him. I killed him, I should – I should bury him.
 Don't! I heard you talking to him. Making some secret deal with Klaus? You said you were going to protect Jeremy! Keep me from this. You said that I could trust you, Stefan.
 No, it's not complicated, Damon! You want to know why? Because - because he's dead now. You told me to kill him, so I did.
 I –I killed someone. I – I killed someone.
 
 
 You're not here. I'm – I've got to be dreaming.
 Because you're...
 Because you're dead.
 You're a ghost. That's gotta be it. You're a ghost, that's what's happening right now. Jer...Jeremy. Jeremy!
 You're a ghost; you're haunting me. You're a ghost; you're haunting me.
 Oh my god!
 Jer! Jer! Jer! Jer! No, no, no, no, no, no.
 No, no. Jer! Jeremy!
 I can't believe this happened. What am I going to say to him?
 I don't want to talk to him. He's been lying to me and hiding things from me. He compelled Jeremy to forget God knows what.
 I don't trust him right now, Damon.
 I just - I need to go upstairs and shower. Clean all the blood off my hands.
 I don't want your help right now, Stefan.
 Don't make this about Damon. You've been working with Klaus doing God knows what, and don't insult me by trying to deny it.
 I don't know what to think, but I do know that I don't want to talk to you and I don't really wanna be around you right now.
 No! 
 I wasn't myself. I was angry.
 You staked me.
 No!
 Damon....
 No!
 Let go of me.
 I'm not gonna kill myself. I would never do that.
 You went through this?
 So, you knew that this would happen if Connor died? That's why you got involved. Did Stefan know too?
 What else does Stefan know?
 How did you make it stop?
 Just...please go away.
 It was horrible. It was the worst thing that I've ever done.
 No, I'm not.
 I am telling the truth.
 Fine! I liked it. I loved the taste of your blood. Are you happy?
 I'm sorry. I'm – I'm really sorry.
 Don't.
 I'm not going to let you do this to me.
 Katherine?
 Shut up!
 I made a mistake. I can do better.
 I am nothing like you.
 Shut up!
 I never wanted that.
 I'm not gonna kill myself!
 No, no. 
 Mom?!
 
 Because I'm a monster. And I deserve to die.
 I can't do this. I can't leave Jeremy.
 But Mom, he won't have anyone.
 
 Damon?
 How did you find me?
 You were right, Damon. Vampires kill people. Stefan was right too. I can't live with myself.
 He's gone.
 
 My head's clear. I can remember everything, but not like I lived it, like it was a really bad dream. 
 I just can't believe that I almost...
 Yeah, but if it wasn't for you...
 I'm sorry that I stabbed you.
 You didn't kill him, did you?
 Stefan, why did you send Damon to come look for me instead of you?
 I didn't mean to not...
 You've been so strong for me. Helping me, fighting for that girl that chose you, the girl that I was when I died on the bridge, and I love you so much for wanting to find this cure. Because I'd like nothing more than to get her back, because the – the girl that she's become, that – that I've become is different, somehow. Darker. Who I am, what I want...
 Something's changed, between Damon and me. Much more than it ever used to be. It's like – it's like everything that I felt for him before I was a vampire...
 I'm sorry. I don't want to lie to you.
 I know.
 It's not like I don't love Stefan anymore, but I can't deny that ever since I turned, my feelings for Damon have become more intense.
 He did?
 Is he okay?
 Well, what was I supposed to do? Lie to him?
 Well, he did and that's exactly what I am. Confused. I need to figure out what these feelings actually mean.
 You're Professor Shane.
 He's the one who told Damon how to break the hunter's curse.
 And now he's judging Miss Mystic Falls?
 Jack of all trades or kind of creepy?
 Yeah, please, this clasp is tricky.
 Hey, I, uh, picked up your clothes from the dry cleaner's. They should be hanging on your door.
 Blue.
 Safe is good when it comes to the judges.
 The red is pretty.
 Whichever one you want to wear, April.
 Damon.
 We need to talk.
 What did he say?
 So, he didn't tell you why?
 You.
 He's probably up there with the escorts.
 What nightmares?
 I'll find him, but...
 April's about to get abandoned.
 Okay.
 I'm calling him right now.
 He's not picking up.
 Matt said that Jeremy's been having nightmares about killing vampires and he's been hiding it from me.
 I don't know. I have a bad feeling.
 Okay.
 Maybe Damon's right. Maybe he grabbed a bottle from the bar and snuck off to the woods.
 I don't know, but why do I think that you won't hesitate to tell me?
 Wow, Caroline, thank you for making this very difficult time so much easier.
 Jeremy.
 Hey, where have you been?
 What are you doing with that?
 Put it down.
 You're nothing like Connor.
 Why would you say that? It's me, Jeremy.
 Yeah, but I'm also your sister.
 Jer, I would never do anything to hurt you.
 Get – get it away from me.
 Jer, Jer, hey, Jer, wake up. Jer, please wake up.
 I have to find Jeremy. This shouldn't be happening to him.
 What are you talking about?
 Tell me that Jeremy hasn't been with you this entire time.
 Tell me that you haven't been making him kill vampires, Stefan.
 If getting my humanity back means stripping Jeremy of his, then I don't want the cure.
 You mean me. The only way to fix me. You don't have to love me like this. This is who I am now. The old Elena died when she went off that bridge. Let her go.
 I can't stay at home anymore.
 Thanks.
 My brother wants to kill me.
 Jeremy can't live with me, Stefan wants to fix me, and Caroline flat-out admitted that she doesn't like me this way. I think it's safe to say that I'm not so great at this vampire thing.
 That dance that they did today kind of reminded me of when...
 I wanted to dance with you today.
 Hey.
 No I don't have to be at school for....
 That face.
 I got it. Ahem.
 What - oh! 
 You didn't even know what I was gonna say.
 He should know.
 Well, he knows that something is going on between us. I mean, it's the reason that he and I broke up.
 Maybe we shouldn't  
 
 Hey.
 See you in history?
 Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?
 Matt is at the house staying with him right now to make sure he keeps all of his hunter stuff in control. He's OK.
 Oh   I was in a rush. I mean   look, do you girls have any plans tonight? I'm in desperate need of some girl talk. 
 We're not judging.
 Don't listen to her. So, girls' night? We can raid the Salvatore wine cellar.
 
 You being here makes your selfish, secret day a little difficult, don't you think?
 I can't. You know I can't.
 
 
 One for you.
 One for you.
 Actually, it's for me.
 Thanks to Damon, I am now a functional dysfunctional vampire.
 Well, he suggested that I try it again. So I did and it worked. No more snatch, eat, erase.
 "Out with Stefan for the night, don't wait up. Brother bonding."
 I know that you're not the biggest fan, but he kind of just changed my life. Would you mind laying off on all the hate?
 
 
 
 So, what exactly was it about him that made you jump right into bed with him as soon as you met him?
 He's always been there for me when I needed him.
 Well, maybe I did.
 Yeah, I did. Look, I know you two have issues with him, but I'm happy, and I wanted to spend tonight with my best friends so that I could tell them about it.
 Party is over. You guys need to leave.
 Do you think it makes me happy that you guys hate him? I get it. His track record has been kind of spotty but I don't hate him. I can't. He's - I think I'm falling in love with him.
 What are you talking about?
 No. There's no way, I...
 
 
 Now!
 I said leave.
 Caroline?
 Bonnie says no luck with the locater spell.
 Well, what do they want with Caroline?
 But Adrian doesn't, does he? I mean he's still sired to Klaus.
 No, wait, wait, wait, wait. If you really want to hit Klaus where it hurts, then torture me instead. He's fixated on keeping me alive. You want real revenge or not?
 You've got my hands pinned down.
 Just please don't tell Stefan about me and Damon.
 I promise that I'll tell him. I just - I need to figure out some stuff first.
 Thankfully we had our good witch. You know, your hottie-creepy Professor really knows his stuff, Bonnie.
 Hey.
 How was your night?
 Same.
 I know that I'm sired to you, Damon.
 Caroline told me. That's what you and Stefan were doing, isn't it? Is there a way to break it?
 Tyler told me the bond doesn't affect how I feel, just the way I act. My feelings for you haven't changed, Damon. Nothing has changed.
 Okay, fine, yeah, I mean, I've changed. So have you, Damon. And I'm happy. Just like you were yesterday morning before we knew about any of this.
 It is real. I know that it is. Damon, I know what you're about to do. Please, don't do this to me.
 Does this feel wrong?
 Does this feel wrong?
 That was your call, not mine.
 I know.
 I know.
 I know, Damon, but it feels real.
 And I'm not ready to let go of that.
 So do it.
 So, what do you want to do?
 So do it.
 I have to meet Bonnie. She's teaching Jeremy how not to kill me.
 Wanna come?
 I invited him.
 This is your house now, Jer.
 You have to invite me in.
 I'm not sure what to say.
 Every holiday, we came here. This place was family. And when mom and dad died, Jenna made us come here and we thought it was an awful idea, but it was like they were here with us.
 They would have wanted us to stick together, Jer. To fight for each other, no matter what.
 It didn't work. I shouldn't have put so much hope into reprogramming someone's mind. If it were that easy, then you and I wouldn't be in this situation.
 Right? 
 It's complicated.
 Any ideas how to hypnotize me out of it?
 Damon.
 What? How?
 So, it's a cure for immortality?
 And what's in it for you? If not the cure, then what?
 Jer and I should take these decorations home with us. We could use the holiday cheer.
 I think Shane's gonna get us through this. I trust him.
 But you clearly don't.
 What?
 
 Jenna used that to make out with Logan Fell.
 Of all the drama, you're missing the actual fun part.
 Damon, you can't keep telling me that this isn't real. I know how I feel and that you feel it too, so stop fighting it.
 You're thinking about how upset he'll be when he finds out that you and I are together.
 No, you were helping me with Jeremy.
 What? No, Damon.
 Damon, please.
 I was ready to fight you on this, but suddenly every part of my body is telling me that I need to get in this car and leave you.
 Be right back.
 April, what's wrong?
 But you're crying?
 Wait, what?
 What the hell is going on?
 Rebekah isn't who you think she is, April.
 Listen, we can figure this out, but we have to get out of here.
 "Hey, it's me. Look, I know why you sent me away. You think what I'm feeling for you is because of the sire bond. But I hate not being near you. And I"-
 -"being near you, and I miss you, Damon. I wish you would just let me come to you."
 Stefan...
 A map.
 I think you're sad and bored and in desperate need of a hobby.
 I didn't sleep with Damon because of the sire bond. I slept with Damon because I'm in love with him.
 Dare.
 Being with Damon makes me happy.
 When I'm with him...it feels unpredictable, like...like I'm free.
 Lately, I feel like I'm a project, like I'm a problem that needs to be fixed. I think I make him sad, and I can't be with someone like that, because when he looks at me, all he sees is a broken toy.
 Yes.
 No.
 What?
 That door's not gonna hold him!
 Bonnie, what's going on?
 And you couldn't control it?
 No, we can't leave. Rebekah's compelled us.
 Stefan...
 Stefan, we have to talk about this. Please.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry about all of it! I'm really sorry, Stefan. I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't want that.
 Stefan? No!
 Stefan, wait.
 Stefan knows about us.
 How do you think?
 How's Jeremy?
 You know that I trust you.
 Thanks for looking out for him.
 Not yet. Something happened today. I realized something about you...about us. And you can say that it's the sire bond, and you know what, maybe-maybe, it is. But I'm telling you, it's the most real thing that I have ever felt in my entire life. I love you, Damon. I love you.
 Damon-
 I'll be there soon.
 Are you okay?
 Oh my god...
 Jeremy, what's going on?
 What the hell were you thinking? 
 I don't care about the cure, Damon. Not if it means putting the people that I love in danger.
 He killed someone. These were innocent people.
 
 I'm sorry? Are saying I should leave him here with you?
 I'm so sorry. Listen. When I asked you to stay with Jeremy, I never thought 
 I never wanted anyone to get hurt.
 Sire bond doesn't work like that.
 Jeremy?
 Whoa whoa whoa, slow down. Where's Damon?
 This is your fault. You started this when you forced Jeremy to kill those vampires.
 Call him off, Klaus.
 Whatever our differences, we want the same thing. Please, Klaus, I'm begging you.
 Jeremy, it's over. You can put all this away.
 Okay. Well, Damon's gonna be back soon and then we can figure something out.
 He saved your life.
 I care about you. 
 
 What happened? Are you okay? 
 Thank God you both got away. If Kol had taken Jeremy-
 He's at the Grill. He wanted to check on Matt.
 
 Damon. 
 
 
 Then he can listen. I know you might not care about me right now, Stefan, but Kol compelled Damon to kill Jeremy. They're somewhere in the tunnels, and-it's one giant maze down here, and I can't find them, so if you still care about the cure or about Jeremy, then maybe you can come help. 
 
 Yes, you can. You're strong enough to resist the compulsion. I know that you are.
 Because I love you. Because you love me. You'd do anything for me, so please...do this for me.
 Damon! 
 I need to talk to him.
 I won't let him out.
 Stefan, what are you doing with Rebekah? She tried to kill me.
 Are you trying to punish me? I don't know how many times I can apologize.
 You're hurt. You're hurt, and you're acting out. Stefan, this isn't you.
 What do you want, Klaus?
 Sorry, but I think we'd rather take our chances.
 
 Where are you?
 I know, I'm sorry. I had to, though. I have Jeremy under house arrest because Kol wants to kill him, and Klaus wants to take him on some vampire-slaying road trip. And since neither of them are invited in, it's the only place I can keep them safe.
 Apparently I'm living in a fraternity house now.
 Train yourself to do some dishes, and put these weapons away before someone tries to use one on me.
 Listen, I have a plan to end all of this. I want Jeremy to kill Kol.
 Think about it. Kol's sire line must stretch to the moon by now. If Jeremy kills Kol, every vampire that he's ever turned, not to mention everyone that they've turned, will die, which means the hunter's mark will be complete and we'll have our key to finding the cure.
 
 Sorry.
 I don't know. There's something in the water.
 That's not why I called. Kol just tried to kill Bonnie.
 Yeah, she's just shaken up. She managed to hold him off, but Kol seems pretty intent on murdering everyone who's looking for that cure.
 I don't want to just dagger Kol. I want Jeremy to kill him.
 Bonnie has all this crazy new power. She thinks she can hold him long enough for Jeremy to get a clean shot.
 That's why you need to find the dagger and use it on Rebekah. She can't come looking for revenge if she's laying in a box.
 I know you can't because vampires can't use the dagger, but Matt can. It's not like she doesn't deserve it. And Bonnie thinks that she can get Klaus out of the picture, too, at least temporarily. Once we get this cure, none of this will matter because we can use it against them.
 Actually, it's Elena Gilbert.
 I need to talk to you – in person.
 I wanna call a truce, in the name of Silas.
 I'll meet you wherever you want. I'll come to you.
 Wouldn't that be kind of stupid to invite you in?
 If I let you in, my brother goes. You're not getting near him.
 Sorry, I had to dig up the old people alcohol.
 You lived in New Orleans?
 Why? What did you do?
 I don't have an alliance with Klaus. We had a mutual interest in finding the cure – that's all.
 Yes. And I'm willing to give up looking for it if you promise to leave my brother alone. 
 I'll get some ice.
 Here you go.
 Sure, why not?
 You're really good at that game. Definitely considering you've been locked up in a coffin for a hundred years.
 I've killed. Once. I'm guessing your number's a lot higher than mine.
 Nobody else seems to think Silas exists, so why do you?
 Yeah, but why Silas? Why are you so afraid of him?
 That's pretty biblical.
 So we're out of gin, but I think this is a good year.
 Okay, you caught me. I don't know anything about wine.
 I would do anything for my brother. And if what you're saying about Silas is true, what does it matter what I want if it puts everyone else in danger?
 Is there any chance that you could be wrong about Silas?
 I'm sorry. He left. I mean, I – I tried to stall as long as I could.
 
 Jeremy, now!
 We didn't have a choice. He was trying to cut off Jeremy's arm!
 You said you were going to put him down too.
 I'm just happy to see you.
 We're just waiting for Jeremy's mark to grow.
 Klaus is trapped in our living room.
 We'll find it. Now that we've got Rebekah taken care of, all we need is professor Shane, and then we'll have everything we need.
 What? Why not?
 On our side? Did you really just say that?
 Why would you possibly think that we could trust her?
 Stop it, both of you.
 Oh, my god...
 You know I can hear you, right?
 I'm not apologizing for not wanting her here.
 You know, you're right. With any luck, I'll only have to tolerate her for a few more days, and then we'll find the cure and I'll never have to deal with her again.
 You know, you've never talked about what you'll do with the cure, once we find it. Will you take it?
 Is anyone else a little creeped out?
 And what do you believe?
 Here. Take mine.
 I don't know. I mean...We've all lost someone. The chance to maybe see them again? I kinda get it.
 Jeremy!
 What the hell just happened?
 Shane doesn't know what he's talking about.
 Do you really think that I'm gonna take this cure, break the sire bond, and fall out of love with you?
 This cure is gonna change so many things. Jeremy's not gonna want to kill me anymore. We're finally gonna get rid of Klaus. Bonnie's mom isn't gonna be a vampire. And anyone who wants to take this cure is gonna have that option. Caroline, Stefan, you. If you want it. 
 No, not everything. That's what I'm saying. Damon, not my feelings for you.
 Jeremy! 
 Fine. We'll keep searching the island.
 Jeremy! Jeremy!
 I'm sorry, and how are you helping?
 Not disagreeing on the easy part.
 Technically, you didn't achieve evil status until you killed me.
 No, actually, thank you. This thing would've killed me.
 I'm gonna go back and check on Bonnie, see if she found anything. Be careful.
 
 
 Shane is the only thing that's keeping Bonnie safe, and you try to kill him? And you wonder why Bonnie hates you.
 How can you say that right now?
 I'm not fighting with you about this anymore. Being human isn't gonna change my feelings for you.
 So, things aren't easy and you're just gonna push me away now? That's what you do, Damon. You think that you don't  you don't deserve something, so you ruin it. I'm not gonna let you pull that this time.
 Take the cure with me. 
 
 Well, Bonnie's not here and Shane's stuff is all gone.
 What are you doing in my tent?
 What are you talking about?
 I didn't take it, but here. 
 Exactly, Rebekah. We're screwed. Bonnie's gone. Shane's got the tombstone. Jeremy's missing. Who knows if Damon's coming back. So, us three, right here, this is all we've got. So we're either in this together...or it's over. For all of us. 
 I wish I weren't.
 
 
 Meaning somebody probably jumped him and then grabbed him!
 No, I mean, he's not strong enough to take Damon on, even with the element of surprise. He must have someone, or at least a few someones helping him.
 Well, maybe there's something you can do from home.
 So Shane's looking for the cure. We think we can find him. We have pictures of Jeremy's tattoo, but we just can't translate the map.
 
 Thank you, Caroline.
 And once again, everyone's life is in danger looking for this cure because poor Elena can't deal with being a vampire.
 Stefan, why didn't you tell me that you wanted the cure for yourself?
 Yeah, I mean, I know why you would want to take it, but what I'm saying is...why didn't you tell me?
 Well, I'm glad you told me now.
 Between friends? I like that.
 What did Caroline say?
 Wait, wait. Um...maybe you should leave the map behind. In case you fall, you don't want anything to happen to the phone.
 There's only one cure? 
 Don't be. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.
 Things changed the minute that I went off that bridge, Stefan. Even if I could be human again, I wouldn't be the person that I was. 
 I guess we'll have to deal with that when I get home. 
 Pity party over. We have to go.
 We're not gonna leave you.
 Stefan? 
 
 You okay?
 
 Jeremy! Oh, no. No. No. Oh, god, no. Oh god...
 Come on. Let's get him upstairs.
 No. I'm fine. I'm just gonna sit here and wait with him until he wakes up. Let me know if you hear anything about Bonnie, okay?
 I'm not in denial. 
 It's possible, Caroline. There's a chance. It may be miniscule, but it's hope and I'm gonna hold on to that hope with everything that I've got because there's no way that m  
 Meredith? What are you doing here?
 
 No.
 No. He's  Stop, okay? 
 He's not dead, okay?
 
 No. No. No, Matt. It's fine. 
 You're not dosing me again, are you?
 We lost Bonnie on the island. Damon stayed back to try and find her.
 He doesn't hate her. I think he actually kind of loves her. You're mean to the people that you care about.
 Damon logic.
 I can't leave Jeremy.
 You brought me to the stoner pit?
 Vicki.
 
 Jeremy and Vicki. Did he do that?
 Is that really what you believe?
 If I compelled you to tell me the truth, is that what you would say?
 
 
 Thank god. Is she okay?
 She knows what to do, doesn't she?
 Okay. We'll be home soon.
 I'll get it.
 I said I'll get it. 
 Jeremy can't come to the phone right now. He's not  
 
 How? How are you gonna help me? How? 
 Just carry him down, please. 
 Okay. I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way.
 
 
 
 Why? Because you want me to not be in denial? You want me to face the truth? This is the truth, Stefan. I don't want to live here anymore. I don't want these sketches. 
 
 
 No, no, no, I can't. I can't. I can't. I  
 I  I  
 How?
 
 I won't.
 
 This is the first person I've seen in days whose body isn't laced with vervain and I'm hungry.
 I don't care.
 
 Sounds like fun.
 What? It's nothing you guys haven't seen before.
 And as for the, uh, "going to school" idea...I've got nothing better to do.
 I have an idea. 
 I did, but now I think it would be really fun to jump around and toss people up in the air. It's not like the routines are that hard.
 Yeah. Should be fun.
 I like your ribbon.
 I want it.
 I'm here, aren't I?
 
 I did, but who cares? I'll do whatever I want.
 
 So talk. You can help me stretch. 
 Maybe. 
 
 
 I don't know. Maybe this is the better version of me.
 Let's see you try and stop me.
 
 It wasn't that hard. You want me to be okay so badly that you hear whatever I want you to.
 
 
 
 So you're grounding me...because I dropped Caroline on her thick head.
 
 
 
 But you clearly do. 
 Look at you. Your whole world revolves around me. Maybe you're the one that needs to turn it all off.
 You were trying to keep me from joining the party, so...I brought the party here. 
 Look who finally joined the party.
 No. That would imply emotions, and we've already established those are useless.
 No. You guys look good together. 
 Just some underage drinking and drug use.
 He's actually busy flirting with your daughter. But I think he's a good rebound for her because of the whole Tyler thing.
 Liz, please. Why don't you just stay and have a drink?
 
 
 Not bad. Not technically good, but then again, Alaric didn't train you. You were probably too busy butting into people's business!
 Are you trying to make me feel bad for hurting your mom? Don't you get it? I don't care. I mean, maybe you should try to turn it all off. Who knows? You might stop whining about how Tyler left you. Added bonus  you won't have to feel guilty about all the dirty thoughts you have about Klaus.
 Make me.
 
 
 How much longer am I supposed to sit here?
 Are you judging me? 
 Don't. 
 Then how should I be? Should I go back to being the scared little girl who couldn't admit what she wants? Is that how you'd prefer me to go back to being, or  Look. For the longest time, you wanted to be with me, but you were scared that I'd find out how awful you are. But it doesn't matter anymore because I don't care. 
 He's gonna hate you for that.
 So where are we going?
 You dragged me all the way to New York because you were feeling nostalgic?
 I was hungry.
 Emotionless. There's a difference.
 So...we're just here to have fun? 
 
 
 How do you know?
 You got Lexied?
 Wait. What the hell are you talking about?
 
 So let me guess. After many dark nights with Lexi, she convinced you to turn your emotions back on, and that's exactly what you plan to do with me. Hmm.
 Not one bit. I know he's after the cure. I'm not stupid.
 
 No. He's playing me. I'm just returning the favor.
 Is this allowed? What would Lexi say?
 I'm hungry. 
 Don't scream.
 
 
 Work together? Don't you hate me?
 Do you remember what it's like to be human? Weak, fragile? Why would you wanna go back to that?
 And that's exactly why I don't want your help. 
 Let me guess. He's worried.
 You and Lexi? Here, on the bar? 
 
 
 It's beautiful up here. I could do this, you know. The Lexi method. Hang with you, party with you. It wouldn't be the worst way to turn my emotions back on.
 I do. Maybe I'm just looking for an excuse to...spend more time with you.
 
 
 What?
 So you pretended to have feelings for her just to get her off your back?
 
 So you're saying that you felt bad for Lexi?
 So you kill her?
 Here's what I don't get. You spent six months trying to get her to fall in love with you just so that you could hurt her. You were spiteful, malicious, borderline evil, and you say that you had your emotions turned off, but those all sound like emotions to me.
 
 
 
 
 I wish this could have gone differently, I really do, but we'll give Katherine your best.
 We've searched three cities in the last 24 hours, I'm sick of Top 40 radio, and I smell like leather.
 
 In a minute. I'm hungry.
 
 Did I?
 You know me?
 
 Me. How do you know me?
 
 Where do I live? Where do I work?
 Who do I spend time with? Do I have any friends?
 What secret?
 Hey, excuse me, um...Do I have any mail today?
 I cut it.
 I was here two minutes ago?
 Yeah, I'm  I'm fine. Um, thanks.
 
 Where's the cure?
 People die. We move on.
 Every minute you two waste with your yapping is another minute we give Stefan and Damon to find us.
 
 Who's "em"?
 It says here you're meeting at two.
 I guess I'll just have to meet "em" myself.
 
 Fine. Your bracelet, watch, earrings. Hand them over.
 And your other bracelet.
 Fine. I really am gonna need that jacket, though.
 
 
 
 Almost there. Something's missing. 
 Come on, Em.
 Elijah. You're a little late, aren't you?
 Thank you. It's actually gonna 
 And I've missed you.
 Do I have what?
 It's in a safe place. Why don't I go and get it and I'll bring it back?
 You're both idiots.
 
 
 And you think she's changed? She's playing you. She lied to you, Elijah.
 My brother's dead. Your girlfriend killed him. 
 I hate to say I told you so, but...duh!
 Just like you hope Katherine will find her way back? You still think that innocent girl you saved from Klaus ages ago is in there somewhere?
 She's not. She's a monster now, Elijah. The sweet peasant girl you fell in love with way back when is dead. And she's not coming back.
 You boys are all the same. Damon and Stefan still think that the girl they love is still in here somewhere, too.
 "Your compassion is a gift, Elena. Carry it with you always and forever." I remember reading that in a letter once.
 I'm sure he did. And it felt good to watch that letter burn, along with my old life and along with Jeremy's body.
 You know I don't want the cure. You need to know that I never will and I'm done talking about it. So...will you accept that and let me be who I am, or not?
 It is now. And you two really need to accept it. Because if you don't, there will be consequences.
 
 Like I said, consequences. That's one body you're responsible for. If you keep trying to fix me, there'll be a second, a twentieth, and a hundredth. It's your choice.
 You're gonna fail. You should be locking yourself inside all day, not shopping for prom.
 Death.
 You realize you won't even be able to compel yourself a date, right?
 Then I want to come with you. Yeah, I'll keep an eye on you to make sure that you pass Elijah's test. As soon as you've gotten the cure, it'll be gone for good and no one will be able to use it on me.
 Hey, Bonnie. Heard you got your mind wiped  that sucks. Pretty dress, Caroline.
 I thought it looked familiar.
 I don't need a babysitter.
 Got you to stop your search for the cure, didn't it?
 No.
 Thank you. I stole it.
 My mom took that when she dropped us off at school.
 I'm gonna get a seizure if I keep staring at these screens.
 You're overage, and honestly, it's kind of creepy.
 Please don't refer to yourself as my date.
 
 What are you doing? Trying to stir some feelings in me? Ironic, since you, my sire, are the one who had me turn them off.
 You're nothing to me, Damon.
 I told you I loved you because I was sired to you, and now that I'm not I know that none of it was real. But if you still think that it was, I mean, maybe you're the one who needs help with your emotions, not me.
 Uh-oh. Friend patrol.
 What are you gonna do, get me a job at the Grill?
 Spare me, Matt. If you had the choice, you would have turned your emotions off the second that Vicki died.
 I thought you were gonna bring Jeremy back, but it turned out you were just a brainwashed crazy-person, so technically you're a walking reminder of all the horrible things that have happened to me.
 Let go of me or I will bite you.
 Yeah, and now I finally see why.
 You think this is my cry for help? I'd be happy to show you what a real cry for help sounds like.
 I feel nothing.
 I don't care.
 Nope.
 Nothing.
 What heart?
 So how do I look?
 Thanks. I thought I'd do it a favor.
 You can't be compelled, but you can be killed. Rebekah wins prom queen. Got it?
 What you were about to do?
 Remember that time you tortured me until I told you how to find the cure? You ruined my relationship with Stefan and then you trapped us with a werewolf?
 So you're not a good person. You're not gonna win this cure by being yourself. So just stand there and refrain from talking, okay?
 Silas is appearing to Bonnie as my dead brother, which means he still wants her to do the spell.
 I'm not worried about my enemies. It's people like Alaric...and Jeremy. The Salvatore brothers are annoying enough as it is. Can you imagine if my brother came back to the living? He'd spend every waking hour trying to get my humanity back.
 Everyone's so worried about Silas, but there's an obvious solution to all of this. He needs Bonnie. He can't do the spell without her. So if you can't kill Silas, kill his witch.
 Maybe you can't, but I can.
 Congratulations, Bonnie.
 For you to stop being a problem.
 Remember when I told you to make Rebekah prom queen?
 You should have listened.
 Damon, help me.
 Bonnie...Please.
 
 Vervain?
 You boys wanna play games? Go ahead. Let's see who breaks first. Me...or you.
 Pass.
 Wait. Something's not right. I don't want to be here.
 What is this...
 We're not really here, are we? We're in my head.
 The last thing I remember...
 You starved me. You and Stefan-
 It's not gonna work, Damon.
 Go to hell.
 What makes you such an expert on who I am?
 I tried to kill you, Caroline. I'm not exactly BFF-material anymore. You should move on.
 This annoying, clingy thing that you're doing  did it ever occur to you maybe that's why both your boyfriends skipped town? I mean, I know that Tyler said he was running for his life, but maybe he was running from you. And Klaus? I mean, let's just say it  nobody likes a tease. 
 Are you seriously talking about high school graduation? Caroline, do you realize how pathetic you're gonna look in that cap and gown, pretending to be human while your mom fake-smiles and just counts down the minutes until you leave town so that you can stop being a reminder that her daughter is a repulsive, blood-sucking control freak monster?
 It's really too bad Stefan stopped me before I put you out of your misery, but hey, here's to second chances.
 You took my ring. I'm devastated. And bored. Can I go back to solitary now?
 Am I supposed to be scared?
 You're not gonna burn me.
 No. And even if you do manage to get my emotions back, I'll remember all this, and I'll hate both of you for it.
 I said, I'm gonna kill you.
 It's kind of funny, actually  you being the one to pull back the curtain. I bet part of you enjoys it, since, you know, I dumped you and all.
 Let me guess...this is gonna hurt you a lot more than it hurts me?
 You know what else blew? Being sired to you...going every day believing that I was in love with you. I remember every horrible moment of it, and you, so scared that it wasn't real. Well, guess what  it wasn't. You were right. So go ahead, keep trying to get the old me back. Who knows? Maybe Stefan and I will give it another go.
 I am the girl that you love. You wouldn't do anything to actually hurt me  you just proved that. So what do I really have to be afraid of?
 What the hell are you doing here?
 That's why you're here? He dumped you, didn't he? Now you're just looking for a scapegoat.
 I didn't have to say anything. Look at you  self-obsessed egomaniac on the run for five centuries. What good would you be to anyone? You're the definition of damaged goods. No wonder Elijah left you.
 Please, help  
 I'm a vampire, Matt. The thing about vampires is that we need to feed.
 Deep down, it probably does mean something. But I'm really hungry.
 Oh, come on, I barely drained an artery.
 Come on! Get up, I'm hungry. My head's fuzzy, I can't think straight. I need more.
 But you're so good!
 Let go of me!
 Seriously? You think this-
 You're bluffing.
 Oh, my god, Matt.
 No...
 No, no, no. It's not okay.
 What have I done?
 No, no. What did I do? I-I almost killed him-Matt, I almost...And Bonnie, and Caroline, I just-
 No, no, I mean, that woman, the waitress, I actually killed that waitress 
 No, I killed that waitress!
 
 No. I'm not okay. But I'll get better.
 The pain's still there...the grief and the shame. But I get it now. Shutting it off  it's a cheat. I mean, you put up this wall and shut out everything that makes you who you are. Nothing affects you, nothing matters. But things do matter, things that happen that can't be undone. And now I know that there's something I need to do about that.
 I  I'm done resting. I have to get ready. There's so much that I have to do.
 Think about it. It's so obvious. Go back far enough, there's one person who brought us to this, who ruined our lives. Look at you two. Everything that's happened to you, she did that! She brought Klaus to Mystic Falls, she turned Caroline into a vampire  she killed my brother. It all comes down to her. Katherine. Okay? Stefan said to focus on one thing, so I did. I focused on hate. And I hate her so much.
 Not if I kill her.
 That did nothing for me. How was it for you?
 Or we could skip the sublimating part, and you can tell me where she is so that I can rip her head off.
 Stefan, you're the one who told me to channel all of my emotions into one single feeling.
 Well.
 You wanted to kill Klaus when you got your emotions back.
 You don't think I can kill Katherine?
 Maybe you're right. Maybe I just want to feel the warmth of her chest cavity as I rip out her heart and watch her face as she realizes I took it from her. 
 You don't have to pretend to be nice to me, Caroline. I know this is just a ploy to keep me distracted.
 
 Wait, do you know where Katherine is?
 Yeah, but, Caroline, if you did, you would tell me, right?
 Caroline, listen to me, if you know where Katherine is then you have to tell me.
 It's not complicated. See that dart board? All I can picture is Katherine's face.
 Look, Rebekah. I get that we had our Thelma and Louise thing back when I had my humanity off, but let me make one thing clear  we're not friends.
 Caroline, I really don't feel like going down memory lane.
 If you're waiting for an apology, you're not gonna get one. I can't let myself feel bad, because if I feel bad, then I feel everything, and...we've all seen how well I handle that.
 Inside looking for Bonnie. I think we should split up. Damon and I can look outside while you and Caroline look inside.
 Where's Katherine?
 You know, don't you?
 Tell me that you don't want her dead. After everything that she did to you? Stringing you along for hundreds of years?
 I don't care about Bonnie. I care about killing Katherine.
 
 What?
 Are you kidding me?
 Is that really the reason?
 And if I can? What if killing Katherine takes away all that grief and guilt? What if killing Katherine finally lets me feel all the good things that I've lost? Damon, help me. As soon as I get over this hurdle, I'll be me. I'll be able to think clearly, I'll be myself, and everything will go back to normal.
 At least I'll die trying.
 Hello, Katherine.
 No. This is how I thank you.
 You have done nothing but suck the happiness out of my life. Well, now I get to kill you.
 Goodbye, Katherine.
 Stefan!
 How could you save her? She was as good as dead.
 How do you know that?
 I don't believe you.
 You never wanted me to kill Katherine. Why are you protecting her, Stefan?
 Do you still have feelings for her?
 Oh, but beating up cinder blocks will?
 So there's no hope? You're saying I'm hopeless?
 Oh, of course you can. God, Stefan! Always trying to help, and you're concerned for me, it's just like 
 I don't need to transfer anything. I can hate two people just fine.
 Just like the cinder block - nothing.
 "Brother and friend"? What genius came up with that one?
 I give up, Jer. I really wanted to kill her for you, but there's no point. 
 I can't - I can't do this. I can't  I can't move on. And I don't want to. If that makes me weak, then fine, I'm weak, but...I can't handle you  I can't handle you being gone. I can't handle feeling like this anymore.
 Go ahead, Kol. Kill me. You'd be doing me a favor.
 Jeremy.
 Bonnie? 
 But I was so horrible to you.
 Stefan, wait 
 There isn't enough time.
 Damon, I'm sorry that 
 No grease on the Other Side, huh?
 Hey, you wish.
 You both suck!
 I did some pretty terrible things.
 But the crying's good. It means that I'm finally feeling something, and right now I...
 It's the Grill – it must be Matt. 
 I don't know where they are, so I guess I can't help you.
 Please, don't hurt anyone. I'll find Silas and I'll get the cure.
 Hey.
 So, I think there's some stuff you and I need to talk about.
 Damon, I can't take that.
 
 I can't.
 What was that?
 Take off your shirt.
 Fine.
 Damon, why isn't this healed?
 We need Klaus. We need his blood.
 That wound will kill you!
 Jeremy's right. If you're human, the werewolf venom won't hurt you.
 Damon, wait.
 We have to do something. If those hunters give the cure to Silas–
 Okay, fine. We're stalling the hunters, but Damon is still dying.
 Gradua– no, Jer, I never even sent in my college applications.
 Jer, no. Not if you can't be there.
 Let's go graduate.
 I'm here. 
 I...kinda sorta missed the deadline. You know, being an emotionless bitch.
 Thank you.
 Are you feeling better?
 So it's all healed up?
 Good.
 Anyone seen Jeremy?
 Yeah. Stefan, can I, um...can I have a moment?
 Honestly, Stefan, I just wanted to thank you. For sticking by me when I was at my worst, for believing that I was still in there. Even after everything I put you through, you...you never gave up on me.
 Here.
 It's yours. I want you to have it.
 Stefan. The only person worse at being a vampire than me is you. Human blood is your downfall. You got the raw end of the vampire deal. The rest of us will be fine, we'll survive. I mean, you taught us. You deserve whatever you want out of life. 
 Good.
 You would rather die than be human, and you expect me to be okay with that?
 Fine, then I'm not sorry either. I'm not sorry that I met you. I'm not sorry that knowing you has made me question everything, that in death you're the one that made me feel most alive. You've been a terrible person, you've made all the wrong choices, and of all the choices that I've made this will prove to be the worst one. But I am not sorry that I'm in love with you. I love you, Damon. I love y–
 Bonnie, Jer, are you guys here?
 What are you doing?
 Of course, because Katherine Pierce can't be happy with good old vampire-caliber immortality.
 I stole your happiness? You killed my brother!
 Kicking someone while they're down...classy till the end, Katherine.
 You deserve whatever you want out of life. You deserve this.
 Have a nice human life, Katherine.
 
 
 Hey, um, sorry, I - I thought you left.
 All right, well, there's pizza in the fri-
 Yeah, I've just got this weird feeling like something bad's about to happen.
 Can't you just be a normal boyfriend and support me as I attempt to have a normal college experience?
 Really stress the drug thing. And I'd definitely say that the fire was an accident, because there's crazy, and then there's...well, me.
 I-I can't leave. I should stay and at least wait until Jeremy settles in to school–
 Okay, well at least Whitmore is only a few hours away, so if there's anything you need, Jer, just call me–
 So, how do you think this whole long-distance thing is gonna work?
 I love you.
 They're not dreams, it's more of a...feeling. Maybe you should call him.
 So I should just live with this nagging pit in my stomach?
 Nice try. Besides, Stefan and I left things in a good place.
 We're in college, Caroline.
 You brought a panini press?
 
 So? Roomie, I think we should drink to something.
 To us, and college, and being functional vampires.
 There must've been a mix-up at the housing office.
 That's exactly what Caroline said.
 Damon, what's the point in going to college if we're just going to recreate what happens in Mystic Falls?
 Did Jeremy get to school okay?
 So, what you're saying is that me being here, you being there...this could actually work?
 Damon.
 Stefan.
 Do you think that I should call him?
 Assuming he registers. And picks a dorm. And buys books.
 Great, then we agree on everything.
 We'll be there.
 I love college.
 What happened to privacy?
 Because we're trying to be functional, and being functional means we need friends.
 Caroline, no–
 Yeah, she's, uh, she's fine.
 That doesn't mean she knows about us.
 Don't you think that, if she was a hunter, we'd be dead by now?
 Caroline, I'm not kidnapping our roommate! The best way to convince her that we're normal, is to act normal. And do normal, human, freshman-y stuff.
 Hey. Flyer Guy.
 I'm Elena, this is Caroline.
 You can't be nice to the guy?
 Are you? Because he hasn't called.
 I'm just saying, I don't want you to get your hopes up thinking that he's coming, when he hasn't really shown much interest.
 Someone must own this place. We have to be invited in.
 Go ahead.
 We were just...Caroline?
 She's late.
 Hey, Megan, it's Elena. Just calling to let you know why we left, so call me when you get this. Bye.
 Or we could just let her know you weren't feeling well.
 There's no way that out of the thousands of freshmen, we were randomly paired with someone who knows about vampires.
 Megan's calling. Hey, Megan.
 Megan, who's chasing you?
 We can't come inside – the line's too long. If you come out – where are you?
 Oh, my god!
 This was a vampire.
 What is happening? Our roommate is dead, there was a vampire at the party...
 
 What?
 I mean, I think so.
 Wait, what do you mean you found a note?
 What is going on?
 Someone's been in here.
 Along with her so-called suicide note. Can I see the phone for a second?
 Whatever's going on, it's not just about our roommate. It's about me.
 That's Megan – with my dad.
 You okay?
 I'm sorry, Caroline.
 I'm really glad you're here, too.
 Wait. Stay with me, Stefan.
 I know this is torture, but stay with me. Your humanity is the one thing that makes you who you are. Don't let go. Please, Stefan. For me.
 What happened?
 I can't. And especially if my dad's connected to this somehow...I need to know why.
 I love you, Damon.
 "I love you." (to Damon)
 "To us, and college. And being functional vampires."
 Yeah, I've just got this feeling like something bad's about to happen.
 Can't you just be a normal boyfriend and support me as I attempt to have a normal college experience?
 We could be doing anything right now, Stefan. Be anywhere. Why here? Why this?
 This can't last forever. You're just distracting yourself.
 Megan's memorial outside is growing by the minute.
 Caroline, she's dead. You can stop competing with her.
 You talked to Tyler?
 How's the snooping going? Any explanation why our vervain-laced, 
 Oh, um, I went by the hospital this morning — Megan's death certificate. It says she died of suicide. No mention of the gaping vampire-bites on her neck. So, whoever signed off on the cause of death was part of the cover-up, just like the Founders Council back home.
 A.K.A., our Applied Microbiology professor. I switched our classes around, so that we could—
 You're not going to be an Anything major if we get exposed as vampires!
 We are still gonna have our fun year, Caroline, but we have to protect ourselves. The way Damon kept his secret in Mystic Falls was because he infiltrated the Founders Council. So, bust out those alleged acting skills, and let's get on it, okay?
 She'll be there.
 What? You said you wanted to make bad decisions about boys. He's cute, he's interested, and most importantly, unlike Tyler, he's here.
 But hott-ie.
 Uh, that's the, um...um...I don't know.
 It was mortifying. We just sat there in silence.
 Not yet. Whatever he knows, I'm gonna get it out of him.
 No, because chances are, if he knows about vampires, then he also knows about vervain.
 No, I didn't threaten him.
 Damon!
 What would a hero do?
 Stefan?
 Stefan's here, right now.
 Never do that again, okay? I thought something terrible happened to you.
 Ouch.
 I know. Where did you go?
 You talked to Damon? Because I just spoke to him, and he didn't really say anything.
 What Jeremy situation?
 Expelled?
 Wait, how do I not know about this? Where the hell is Jeremy?
 Why are you so worried about him?
 Did he really think that I wasn't gonna find out?
 I just figured we were at a place where he wouldn't have to lie to me. I probably shouldn't be talking about this with you.
 Route 9? I mean, there was this old campsite that we used to go to when we were kids.
 Wait, who texted you?
 Boyfriend drama.
 What is his deal, anyway?
 Yeah, him.
 Okay.
 Brilliant and creepy.
 What, like middle-aged men at an elk lodge?
 Damon? What the hell?
 Mad can wait. Sit.
 Get you alone, weaken you, and then kill you.
 Damon, I'm so sorry, I— What the hell is happening?
 Silas? But I—
 How is that possible? I was in a crowd full of people. I hugged him, I was talking to him about my life, and about—
 Wait, if that was Silas...where's Stefan? What happened to Stefan, Damon? 
 You're right. Every time I look at you, all I wanna do is kill you.
 I can't.
 
 Tell me what's going on.
 Poor Bonnie...she must have tried to call me right after Silas stole my phone. Has anyone talked to her, is she okay?
 My best friend's dad died. It's pretty damn important.
 I just left. What the hell is wrong with you?
 My brother got expelled! You've got him playing white knight to Katherine, who's tried to kill me — repeatedly. Stefan's been — he's been suffering, for months, while I've been rolling around with you, a self-proclaimed serial killer. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
 I can't okay! All I can think about is killing you!
 What? I — no, I can't...
 It's...it's like a chill, but I can't explain it...It's like I can feel him. He's trying to reach out to me, but I don't know where he is, and I can't understand what he's trying to say. All I know is that he's scared, and he's lonely, and he's in a lot of pain. He's in a lot of pain. We have to find him.
 The rage...It's gone.
 I'll be back, roomie. I don't know when, but I will be back.
 I will, I promise.
 Yeah, I know.
 Bye.
 You knew my dad?
 So, does that mean that he forged death certificates, too?
 Um, yeah, I would, but I've got other important things on my plate right now.
 Caroline'll take over. I can't stay here knowing that Stefan's out there somewhere.
 That's Stefan's daylight ring.
 I love you. We're gonna save Stefan, and I'm still gonna love you, okay?
 Oh, my God. That's not Stefan.
 Stefan's been reaching out to me. He's in a lot of pain. We have to find him.
 Stefan's been reaching out to me. All I know is that he's scared. He's in a lot of pain. We have to find him.
 Stefan.
 Stefan's here, right now.
 Megan's memorial outside is growing by the minute.
 Caroline, she's dead. You can stop competing with her.
 You talked to Tyler?
 How's the snooping going? Any explanation why our vervain-laced ... vampire-slaughtered roommate had a picture of my dad on her phone?
 I had a dream about Stefan.
 It was more than just a pit in my stomach this time, though. It was real. It was like I was there with him.
 You're right. It's weird. Sorry.
 It was just so vivid. I saw Stefan walking out of this bar. It had a red awning and this broken neon sign, and he was screaming in pain.
 I had a feeling that there was something wrong all summer, and I ignored it. But I was right, Stefan was in a safe, and probably killed whoever it was that found him...I know it sounds crazy, that I'm following some psychic dream, but it's the only lead that we have.
 Please tell me that she's not coming?
 Can't we just stash her in the cellar? Or maybe a deep, dark well with a pair of water wings?
 You were trying to kill me!
 I'll know when I see it.
 They weren't dreams. It was just a bad feeling, like something wasn't right with him.
 Are we really just gonna leave her in the car?
 It is. It looks exactly like it did in the dream. Isn't that a little freaky?
 
 What did you do?
 Katherine, run!
 I've never seen her before.
 I'll go chase after her. You find Stefan.
 We don't have time for a detour. Damon, Stefan's hurt. Find him.
 Let's go before she doubles back.
 If Silas wants you, that means you're leverage.
 You think that because we share the same dreams and both care about Stefan that we're alike, but we're not. I value my humanity, which is why I let you live—to give you a chance to find whatever shred of humanity's buried underneath five hundred years of bad behavior.
 Nah. That was just a happy accident.
 Stefan!
 Stefan! Hey! Oh, no. Stefan, hey. Stefan, can you hear me? Stefan! Wake up. Oh, god.
 It's me. I just wanted to let you know that we found Stefan. Unfortunately, we lost Katherine along the way. Hey, are you okay? You sounded weird on the phone earlier. I was worried.
 You called and asked me if we'd found Stefan, and if Katherine was safe. I told you where we were headed. You don't remember?
 Okay.
 He's lucky he has a brother who looks out for him. Otherwise, you might have pawned it for a pinball machine.
 You're suspiciously quiet. Tell me what Qetsiyah said back at the cabin.
 And what does she know about us?
 The universe?
 So, she's crazy?
 Look. I know I spent the last couple days focusing on trying to find Stefan, but that has nothing to do with how I feel about you, and I'm not gonna let Silas' two thousand-year-old ex-girlfriend screw things up between us.
 Stefan...we missed you.
 Please tell me I wasn't out of my mind leaving Damon in charge of Vampire Amnesia 101.
 One text – "So far, so good." Which, in Damon speak...
 Caroline!
 Okay, Dr. Forbes. Since when do you know so much about amnesia?
 You did all that for Stefan?
 Jesse? Dr. Maxfield's incredibly hot, funny, and miraculously single lab assistant?
 As in creepy first date?
 I hope so, I really do. It just depends on how Stefan's handling the whole download of his dark and stormy past.
 And there I thought catching up on nearly two centuries would be a drag.
 Elena.
 
 Right. Well...
 So, Mr. "So Far, So Good," Mr. "I Can Handle My Brother," Mr. "I Know What I'm Doing."
 Hmm.
 Bonnie. A witch did this to him. Maybe a witch can undo it.
 That guilt came from a blood addiction that might still be hard-wired in his brain.
 Hey. Where'd he go?
 Well, let's see. In the last three years, I lost my adoptive parents, my birth parents, my aunt, our guardian Alaric and my brother Jeremy died, although he came back to life, so there's that.
 Yeah. After I had a breakdown and burned my house to the ground.
 What?
 I surround myself with amazing people who help me through it. Like you. You're one of those people.
 Well, no. Officially, we met somewhere else first, but, um, you want to see?
 Anything?
 Actually, I think you were coming from that direction 
 This is where we collided. Let's try again. Shall we?
 Yeah, I know. Right. I'm sorry. I...It's just that seeing you like this is so...strange.
 Let's just say I was having a pretty horrible first day.
 I want to show you something. Come on.
 Come on.
 Close your eyes.
 
 All right. You can open them. The view's great! Come on up.
 Jump. Just push off with every ounce of strength that you have.
 You're the one who whooshed me to the top of a Ferris wheel once before I was a vampire.
 I thought Damon hadn't gotten to that part.
 Uh, yeah.
 Actually, no. You were the most compassionate person I'd ever met. You hated the idea of hurting anyone. The guilt would overwhelm you. You were always in control.
 No. Stefan, it wasn't you. It was me. Becoming a vampire changed me.
 Why don't I show you? 
 I don't know. Maybe it was fate drawing me back, saying that I cheated death the first time.
 Because the second time you saved my best friend Matt because I asked you to.
 No. You were the perfect boyfriend. You valued what I wanted even if it wasn't what you agreed with.
 Fair enough.
 You're remembering?
 Good.
 You were never a monster.
 Well, you never scared me. The first time I saw you for what you were, I touched your face like this 
 I'm with Damon.
 Yeah.
 We weren't hiding it from you. It's not that—I'm sorry. I just...
 I'm sorry, Stefan.
 Hey! Where are you? I've been calling.
 Damon, Stefan's gone.
 I told him about you and me, and he just—he stormed off and said that he was hungry. Damon, there's an entire graveyard full of people here tonight.
 Stefan. There you are. We've been looking everywhere for y–
 Stefan, wait.
 But...
 We need Bonnie. Why hasn't she called us back? It's so unlike her. He can't stay like this.
 Did you talk to her? What did she say? There's got to be something that she can do. I mean, she'll figure it out. She always does.
 What?!
 
 I can't believe this is happening.
 I can't believe she's gone.
 
 
 
 I wouldn't miss it. 
 
 Hey.
 Avoiding you? What? We've been talking.
 And you never replied. So I'm guessing this special, in-person visit means yes?
 It's at eight o'clock. Caroline got us costumes. 
 To class. I'm late.
 Hey.
 I'm Elena. Megan used to be my roommate. Did you know her?
 Oh, wow. I'm sorry.
 Everyone mourns differently. Some do flowers. Others do what their loved ones would've wanted.
 They said she committed suicide.
 So then, what do you think happened?
 Hey, do you have a name?
 Uh, you, my king, my not-so-loving husband.
 Yeah, maybe. Maybe later.
 Bonnie died three months ago, and what was I doing? I was having the summer of my life with you.
 I know it's not my fault that Bonnie died, but it is my fault for not figuring it out sooner.
 I should've figured it out, Damon. I know that it's not the same, but I'm not gonna let Megan's death fall through the cracks, too.
 It's Megan's hometown friend, i.e. the latest person of interest in the Whitmore mystery. I'll be right back.
 Hey, whatever your name is. Nice t-shirt, understated.
 Anne Boleyn, pre-beheading, obviously.
 So, does a costume compliment earn me, like, a formal introduction?
 
 Then why are you acting so shady?
 
 Actually, she was beheaded with a sword.
 And you are Abe Lincoln?
 Okay. Yeah. I can see that. So, where's Mr. Hyde?
 So, would it be totally inappropriate if a student asked you to dance?
 Major points for the dance moves, but zero points for lying on my roommate's death certificate.
 Huh.
 What's that?
 What do you know about vampires?
 And why is that?
 Oh, my God. Stefan.
 Silas? Damn it. What the hell is going on?
 So, if that's Silas, then he's not a problem anymore. This is a good thing, right?
 He said that if I don't drop out of school, the wrong people are gonna start asking the right questions.
 I don't know, but all I do know is that finding out the truth about Megan isn't gonna bring Bonnie back.
 So, the only way for Silas to trade in his life for Bonnie's is if he's a witch, but the only way to become a witch is to have the cure.
 What?
 You've got to be kidding me.
 This is nice.
 Quiet, still, peaceful. I like our life when it's like this.
 Ughhhh. 
 
 
 Damon, it's a good day.
 You said that now that you're a witch again, you would bring Bonnie back from the other side.
 And you promised Damon you would do that if he helped you.
 But you're kind of evil. No offense.
 So I'm just trying to figure out how I can trust that one of your last acts in the world will be to bring my best friend back.
 The anchor?
 
 Are you serious? 
 This is ridiculous. We're bringing my best friend back from the dead. I'm going.
 Who's this?
 Tessa. Where's Stefan?
 Yeah. Remind him that you're a crazy bitch.
 He's with Tessa. Why does he keep going back to her?
 Tell me what?
 As if he didn't hate us enough. Damon, oh, God. I'm going over there.
 Sounds like he's more mad at you. Maybe he and I can find some common ground.
 Where is he?
 I'm really sorry. I wouldn't have let Damon do what he did to you.
 Look. I get that you're upset with us for pretty much everything, but do you really think that sleeping with Tessa is gonna solve anything?
 Okay. I just came by to make sure she that hadn't done some, like, fatal attraction spell on you. Now that I know you're good, I'm gonna go.
 Damon.
 How did you get here?
 Here, alive, from the Other Side. How did you come back to life?
 Well today, Silas was going to bring her back to life after he got the anchor, but you told my boyfriend, who has never put anyone's life before mine, including his own, to kill Silas before he could do that. So no. I'm not sad about the pizza.
 Okay. I get it. You hate me. You might not have any memories, Stefan, but I do. This person, she's not the type of person you would like.
 Yeah. It's weird. Even with no memory, you're still you.
 Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Your instincts were always to protect me, so, thank you for  for just being you.
 Well, he, uh, saved my life, so I'll take that as not hate.
 Did I say anything?
 We're gonna keep trying, Bonnie. Okay? It's not over. We've dealt with much worse.
 We need to protect?
 
 Morning. I made coffee. How did you sleep?
 First night back in your own bed. Not as comfy as Tessa's couch, huh?
 I miss you. I feel like when you lost your memories, I lost a friend, and I was thinking instead of just describing how much we meant to each other, maybe we could just start fresh. Hi, I'm Elena.
 What?
 Wait. Hang on. How do you remember that?
 Really? Are you serious? How?
 
 Stefan.
 Stefan, where did you go?
 We have a situation.
 Yeah.
 We need to buy some more time, protect Amara. Maybe we should move her somewhere else.
 We can't let him anywhere near her until he brings Bonnie back.
 So, what, I should just give up? Come on, Stefan. You got your memory back. You know me probably better than anyone else. Do you really think that I'm gonna give up?
 So long as he's alive, I'm holding out hope that he can still help us.
 Amara exists in both places at once, here and the Other Side?
 You're right. Jeremy, you're right. So, all we would need is someone who could do that spell.
 Think about it. Silas wants Amara to die, and Amara wants Amara to die, so who, besides us, in the one person with the biggest stake against letting that happen?
 Haven't you heard is bad luck to kill your doppelgänger?
 And what if he kills you first? Witches aren't exactly easy to take down. We just got you back, Stefan. Don't do anything crazy. You and I have been down the revenge road, and it's not worth it.
 I'm so sorry.
 It's Bonnie's grimoire.
 What is happening?
 Silas is here.
 And where's the other crazy?
 No way.
 It's a flesh wound. Get up. 
 That's because Stefan took her. You have to go find him before he gets himself killed.
 He's hurting. Damon, he's not thinking clearly. Okay, Silas may have been the one that put him in that safe, but we were supposed to get him out of it. Please go find him. We can't lose him again.
 Bonnie?
 You're here!
 So, he's dead. It's over.
 Are you okay?
 Look at me and tell me that killing Silas worked. That you'll be okay now.
 Because I know how much he stole from you.
 And because while you were suffering in that safe, grasping onto hope, fighting every second so you wouldn't lose your humanity...I was happy. I got everything that I wanted, Stefan. I got to be in love, I got the summer of my dreams, I got Bonnie back. So I need to know that this worked. I need to know that it's gonna take away all your suffering. I need to know that you're gonna be okay.
 "Technically, I'm a ghost, that people can still see, and touch, so..."
 Well, let's see. Silas and Tessa are gone, and you finally aren't.
 Which equals a massive party. Hopefully. I mean, since each of us have only made one friend in college so far.
 All right. So, Augustine wants us gone. Who cares? It doesn't matter. It's not gonna happen. We're moving on with our lives, together, as functional vampires,—
 
 Okay. I know this is going to sound lame, but 
 This is for Bonnie, and you had a really big part in bringing her back, so, I think you should come. 
 Long time, no see. Hey. 
 I know what you're doing. You like to push people away, but the thing is 
 Forget I said that, forget that I know anything. We're starting over. You're coming to my party. There will be free beer, and it will be really good for you.
 See you tonight!
 The only moody mystery guy that I want to make out with is you. Oh, and speaking of which, invite Stefan.
 Just try, okay? I bought bourbon, so he can just get drunk and hate us from afar.
 Not for long. I brought our stash.
 How are you doing?
 You say it like it's a bad thing. First rule of being a vampire is realizing how awesome you are.
 You been keeping an eye on Jesse?
 And I sent Damon to question Wes.
 He's not going to kill him. He's getting information.
 Okay. Look. I know you're not crazy about Damon and I being together 
 Aaron, hey. You made it.
 Weird. Well, this will make it better. 
 So, hey. How do you know Wes anyway?
 Really?
 What about your parents?
 Mine, too. Birth and adoptive.
 Uh, our car went over a bridge. I lived, they didn't.
 You?
 Bite marks?
 Wow. I think both need another Jell-o shot. I'll be right back. I'm glad that you came.
 No.
 To call Damon, to make sure that he doesn't kill Dr. Wes.
 Jesse feeds on...vampires?
 Hey. Um, the fact that he told you this means that he's still alive, right?
 Good. Please don't kill him, Damon. 
 Damon! 
 He was gonna kill Damon 
 Caroline, I'm so sorry. I 
 I know, and I wouldn't have killed him if I could have done something. He was dangerous. I need you to believe that. 
 
 Aaron. Hey!
 Heard what?
 
 
 
 I don't wanna bother you, especially not right now.
 Okay. Well, um, last night, you told me that Wes was your legal guardian.
 Um, the thing is my boyfriend Damon went to talk to Wes last night, and no one's really seen or heard from either of them since and that kind of worries me, you know? So I  I know how bad the timing, is but I just  I was hoping maybe you could help me find Wes.
 So, you believe what campus security told you?
 Don't you think it's weird that both of your friends committed suicide before the first semester was even over?
 Which is why none of this makes sense. 
 I did some digging. Wes is part of something much bigger than anyone even realizes.
 Oh, um...
 Mmmhmm.
 So, who owns this place? 
 Wait. Hold on. Your last name's Whitmore? So you, like, own this school?
 That's my dad.
 Damon? 
 
 Did he tell you that?
 How long were you here?
 Damon, how did you not go crazy?
 How did he end up here?
 Damon, Wes knew my dad. They worked together. He said that my dad was an Augustine, too. I know that my dad was a vampire hunter, but he was also the town doctor. He was kind and gentle and loving. He wouldn't be part of a place that would cut your eyes out.
 Damon, how did you survive all those years?
 
 But you were here for 5 years.
 Yeah, but you did escape. How did you do it?
 So, did it work?
 How did you get out?
 
 Why? You think I'm gonna judge you?
 Damon, I love you. I love you, and these people tortured you for five years. Whatever you had to do, I don't care.
 
 Aaron, you have to help us.
 What are you talking about?
 No. Megan was inside this house. I hadn't even been invited yet. You just 
 No, Aaron. That's impossible 
 Damon, what are you doing?
 
 
 But we were together a few months ago.
 
 No!
 What's happening? 
 
 
 
 My friends are gonna find me.
 And this, holding people against their will, torturing them? How do you justify that?
 You're a monster.
 What? 
 This is my dad's clinic. We're in the basement.
 
 Do you know if he ever brought a vampire down here?
 I remember coming down here as a kid. 
 Wes, I saw Enzo when I woke up. I know he's alive. Where is he?
 
 Enzo is the Augustine vampire. He killed my roommate Megan, didn't he?
 Let me guess. You're not gonna tell me what phase two is, are you?
 Why did Megan have a picture of my dad on her cell phone?
 They knew about Augustine, too?
 Vampire blood.
 She found Enzo in his cell.
 I heard someone screaming.
 Why?
 Okay, dad.
 
 Oh, my God. That's what you did to Jesse. You turned him into some rabid vampire who only wanted to feed on other vampires.
 Yeah, but he couldn't stop feeding. He tried to kill Damon.
 What? No. No, you can't do that to me. 
 No. Please. You can't do this to me.
 No! Let me go!
 No. 
 Stefan! 
 I'm right here. I'm here.
 I'm here.
 Get me out of here.
 Wait, wait, wait.
 It's weird. Even as a kid, there was something about that basement that creeped me out.
 And I remember my dad talking about this little girl. I think he was talking about my roommate Megan. Look. "January 1999. Saw Megan King today. Megan is seven years old. She suffers from a congenital heart defect with a life expectancy of two months. A single injection of vampire blood appears to be an effective life-saving solution." That's why Megan had a picture of my dad on her phone   because he saved her life.
 My dad used his research to save people, Damon, children, families.
 I don't know. He was my dad. I can't not defend him. 
 I'm not defending you. I'm not defending your decision to kill Aaron's entire family, to go out of town and kill the aunt while we were still together.
 
 What? No, Damon 
 Stop acting like I'm perfect. Damon, I've done horrible things, too. You think I'm gonna stand here and judge you after I find out that you've been tortured for five years?
 No. I'm not leaving this bed.
 What's all this?
 My what?
 You memorized my break up?
 I just have to face reality. When Damon makes up his mind about something, it's done.
 Tell him I don't feel like talking.
 Seriously?
 I know what you're doing. 
 If anyone is drinking to Katherine's last days, it's going to be me.
 She impersonated me...repeatedly. 
 Klaus followed her to Mystic Falls and because of that, we lost Jenna.
 She tried to kill me at least twice.
 What?!
 I think my mind just exploded. Okay. Katherine's upstairs.
 What?
 Congratulations on your intuition. We're here. We volunteered. Now, tell us where Matt is.
 Like your boyfriend, Gregor, hopped a ride inside Matt's body, until Katherine killed him, of course. Your mother killed your boyfriend! Why are we saving her again?
 Oh please. Don't defend her. Especially now...
 So we're just supposed to help you let Katherine take over someone's life?
 What's going on?
 I'm sorry, okay? It's not my place to judge. Especially after everything you've been through.
 You don't happen to speak Czech, do you?
 It's okay. I guess they want doppelgänger blood.
 Right. Blood it is.
 Why aren't we healing?
 That's what Katherine helped you with...Silas aftermath.
 Can I just hate her anyway?
 Thank you.
 So...that's it? All you needed from us was a bucket of blood?
 Let's get out of here.
 Wow. You really don't want to die, do you? I swear, I just heard your heart stop.
 Still alive...sadly..
 So do I. I had this whole speech that I was preparing to give your unconscious body.
 Yes. Uhh...Plus, one more thing. I forgive you.
 I forgive you...You weren't born evil. Your life made you that way...You lost everyone that you cared about way too young and you didn't have a family that looked after you. Sound familiar?
 I'll save it for the funeral we probably won't have for you..
 I just wanted to get the forgiveness part out...It's a part of me that I never want to lose.
 You're welcome.
 Hello?
 What's going on?
 Oh my god.
 Katherine....
 You.. you put Katherine inside of me instead of you.
 Save your daughterly concern. I'm fine.
 Uh.. Where.. what I wanted to go?
 What was that? I couldn't quite hear you.
 Oh my god. No!
 Katherine, GET OUT OF MY HEAD.
 Hi!
 Yeah. Yeah, it's me. I'm here.
 Jeremy, come on!
 To friends!
 Am I seriously that easy to impersonate, or do you guys not know me at all?
 When have I ever danced on a bar half-naked? You think I would come to a college bar, with my under-aged brother and do tequila shots?
 I'm not Elena, Matt. I'm Katherine. It's not me.. you guys know me. I-I-I would never do that, guys! Katherine has taken over my body! This isn't me.
 Hello?
 Hello?
 Stefan.. What are you doing here? Where is everyone?
 Oh. O-O-K. That makes sense. I thought I was going crazy.
 What's going on? Wh-y-y...
 The last thing I remember, I was running through the woods.. m-my head felt like it was being attacked by Katherine's whole life. I saw Damon and I threw my arms around him.. and.. nothing.
 Three weeks ago? Wow. Three weeks... yet it took just one second for Katherine to infect me with some virus that makes me want to kill all my friends.
 Do you really think this whole lock-down is necessary? I mean, I feel fine.
 Well, how did you...
 Liv?
 I need to talk to Damon.
 A little confused, but good. I miss you.
 Hey you.
 Nope! So far, I am symptom free, although Stefan still has me on the, uhh, Damon diet (just in case)
 Maybe.. Katherine put a password on my cell, so I can't use it.
 What?
 Damon! That's not funny! I have no idea what I've been doing for the last three weeks.
 How did she do it?
 Break your heart..
 Ahh.. I'm so sorry. I really am. The last thing I remember, I was running into your arms.. and-and I felt so safe.
 I wanted to fight for you. I still do.
 I think I could schedule you in.
 One question  How exactly do we cure this?
 Oh no.. I'm flunking, aren't I?
 Hahaha. Yeah. You're probably right. Let's add that to the list of the things I need to fix, starting with Aaron.
 I haven't seen or talked to him since he found out that I was a vampire and thought I wanted to kill him.
 Why?
 Uh.. Stefan just got here. He brought me a new cell phone. I'm going to call you right back, okay?
 Uh.. not feeling so good, all of a sudden.
 Yeah..
 Thank you.
 I need more
 I feel fine, Stefan. I just need a little more.
 Come on.. Trust me. I can handle this.
 Yeah.
 She's turned me into a monster! I'm a ripper, aren't I?
 I hate her. No.. you know what? I hate myself. Because I was dumb enough to sit next to her while she was dying and-and actually forgive her!
 Please tell me that's some good news.
 Oh my god..
 Stefan.
 Why did she stay?
 Katherine.. why didn't she run like she normally does? Why did she stay?
 You mean you? She wanted you?
 Did we... ever..
 Oh. Okay. Um. And then?
 Oh my god!
 This isn't me Stefan? Can't you tell? After everything we've been through,  I wouldn't lead you on like that.
 Damon?
 Stop it, okay? Both of you! This is what she wants. Even dead, she is ruining our lives!
 About what? About what, Stefan?!
 What the hell is happening to me?
 I mean, I'm deteriorating slowly. I seem to be hallucinating all of my worst fears. So.. that's been fun.
 You can't. We would tear each other apart, remember? Besides, I look gross.
 Distract me.
 Damon.. Come on. Tell me, what else have I missed?
 What gossip?
 No!
 Are you serious? Caroline and Klaus? I mean...
 Wait.. Does Tyler knows about this?
 Katherine? Katherine is such a bitch.
 Sorry.. I..
 Um.. I just don't understand why Stefan's off at some mystery location. Why don't we just hunt down Wes and force him to make us an antidote.
 What?
 What about Aaron, Damon? He didn't deserve that. Wes was pretty much the closest thing that Aarom had to family.
 Yeah. Okay.
 Aaron?
 I thought you were on spring break.
 I'm sick. It's a long story. Look, I really wanted to talk to you about everything. Because the last couple of weeks, I haven't been myself. Literally. Katherine Pierce has been inside my body and.. uh..
 Why? Did I do something?
 Why is none of your stuff here?
 What do you mean? Are you another hallucination?
 Are you dead? Did I do this to you? Aaron.. tell me that I didn't kill you. Did I kill you? Tell me that I didn't kill you. Please. Tell me that I didn't kill you.
 Uhh.. how did you get in here? I thought the door was closed.
 Do I know you?
 No. Uh. That doesn't sound like a good idea.
 I'm just so thirsty.
 Don't touch me.
 No. What I need is to feed.
 Don't move. I need vampire blood.
 I have to turn you. Sorry.
 What is that? What?
 Or, your "friend" "Elena" was feeding on you. Listen to me.. forget this conversation. Go find Bonnie Bennet and tell her to come here and bring the witch. I need to get out of here right now. Go!
 I don't know what's happening to me, Damon.
 I feel like no one's telling me the truth. Damon, I can't tell what's real anymore.
 I did it, didn't I? I killed him..
 Aaron! That's what you're so afraid to tell me! Aaron! I killed him.
 Now is not the time? Damon, I'm dying! I almost turned a student today, who Katherine had apparently befriended, just so that I could feed on him. When would a good time be!!!? Huh?!
 Nuh uh. No, No, No, No. You're lying to me, Damon. You're lying!
 Why is everyone lying to me? Why are you lying to me? Why is everyone lying to me?!
 I'm cleansing myself of anything Katherine ever touched. Toothbrush, clothes, my sheets.
 Well.. that's ironic. Because I wasn't myself for weeks and yet nobody noticed.
 Are you Liv? I'm sorry if we've met before, I'm really going to need you to drop that seal and let me out right now.
 You think that's dangerous, Bonnie. If you don't drop the seal right now, I will kill you!
 Oh my god. Oh my god. You're right, Bonnie. I can't.. I can't. I'm letting her win.. I'm not gonna let her win.
 You will die if I don't give you my blood to heal you. So, you're going to have to drop the seal. Otherwise, you're going to bleed to death. So.. it's your choice.
 Oh my god. Aaron, are you alive?
 No. No. I'm good now. I'm good now! I thought I killed you.. I didn't kill you! You're right here! You're stll alive!
 She won.. Katherine won.
 Look at me, Damon. Look at me! Look at me! The plague of Katherine Pierce lives on. She's turning me into something that I'm not.  I mean, look at me; I'm a monster. Liv.. the witch, I almost killed her! And my friends.. I want to kill my friends. I think I want to kill my friends
 No! It's not okay! It's not okay, Damon! I... I killed Aaron Whitmore.
 I keep seeing him, he kees popping up everywhere. I'm hallucinating that Aaron's around.
 W-h-at.. What? Why.. was it because of the virus? Did you need to turn him?
 Why is Enzo here?
 No.
 You should've noticed.
 That I was Katherine.. Katherine was me. You should've been the one that noticed.
 If only you'd seen through her, Damon. There would be no vampire virus, Aaron would still be alive...
 And I'm still here! That's how much control you have over me!
 You want me to blame you? Easy! Done! You screwed up, Damon. Again!
 You put me in a position where I have to defend you, again, where I have to bend my morals, again. Where I have to go against every single thing thar I believe in, again, because I love you!
 I can't!
 I know..
 It just did. It's over.. We're over.
 Oh! Um, Did I wake you?
 Really? Because you didn't say a word.
 Well, I didn't really have much to say. Nothing has changed. We're still bad for each other and we are still broken up. Last night was a mistake.
 Oh. Seriously, Damon. Put some clothes on, or at least get out of my way. I need to go.
 Damon and I broke up. It's final.
 Last night
 Post breakup
 Was that irresponsible?
 No. He wasn't at the house last night; thankfully.
 I.. don't know. That doesn't really help with the whole irresponsible thing, does it?
 Bonnie?
 I think his name is Luke.
 Nice try, but, uh, I think Damon is more of his type.
 Hey, look Bonnie, I, uh, I gotta go. Thanks for listening
 Hey, Mrs. Douglas.
 You too
 Then who is?
 Is that why you're here?
 So no other reason?
 Can we just focus on Jeremy, please?
 What are you talking about? What girl?
 Jeremy wouldn't do that to Bonnie
 He learned his lesson. Jeremy's not a cheater.
 Can we not talk about that right now?
 We do care, we really do. We'll.. we'll do better
 Just because Jeremy's a bad student, it doesn't mean that he's cheating on Bonnie.
 And you keep trying to make this about us.
 You know what? Fine. But don't pretend you came here for Jeremy. If you wanna talk about last night, talk!
 Right
 Shut up.
 Shh, I said no talking.
 I need some air.
 Liv? Hey... What are you doing here? Is this about Jeremy?
 I don't know what you're talking about.
 ENOUGH!
 Damon, stop!
 This is exactly why we broke up. Please tell me you understand that.
 If you do, then what? Am I suppose to hate you, or resent you? Or forgive you?
 Jeremy
 Jer, after all of the things you've been pulling at school, how can I trust you? You haven't exactly been making good decisions. Okay?
 Let's go, Damon.
 I trust him, okay? And right now, I really need you to trust me.
 I'm thinking Ms. Douglas is right.
 She spelled it out for us, Damon. It's not that we're bad for each other. We're just bad for Jeremy.
 What? No, Jer. You don't have to do that.
 Jeremy, I-I know things have been a little crazy lately, but..
 Okay. I'll call every day and I'll... I'll make sure to stay more involved.
 I'm going back to campus.
 It's not about Jeremy. It's about us. It's not just that we're bad for each other. It's just that when we're together, we do bad things for each other. And I can't live like that.
 If you do that, then I'm going to spend the whole car ride thinking about your hand next to mine and even though I'll try, I won't be able to stop myself from taking it. Or from letting you kiss me. And we're never going to get to where we need to go, we'll just end up back here, where we started. That's why I need you to let me go.
 No, Damon...
 Uh, yes. It's a particularly mortifying page from my journal.
 And I'm pretty sure that you're not the journal police. Trust me, it's really bad.
 And I'm officially not kidding. Thank you. I'm Elena.
 Yeah. I just  I just had a really crazy dream.
 Sure.
 I'm gonna need these. I'm so clumsy.
 No. I didn't hate it. I just wasn't exactly paying attention either.
 So do you want to dinner some 
 Sure.
 Sorry. That's my dad, waiting up for me. So embarrassing.
 Me, too.
 Good night.
 How did I get here? I was just standing at the doorway.
 It didn't feel like a dream, ok? It felt like it was real, like I was just there.
 Caroline, if you bite your tongue any harder, you'll bleed. Say it.
 It's not just about Stefan, ok? My parents were still alive. It was like a different life.
 They're not sex dreams.
 So where's,uh  where's Damon?
 Hi.
 Well, at least they're not being obvious. You got a pool table.
 Yeah. I went running today, 10 miles. Could have gone 20.
 Probably not a good idea. Inhibitions and all.
 Can we not do this?
 I mean, the whole strained, awkward, don't know how to act part.
 Can't we just be friends and do friendly things?
 Wow! Ok. Yeah, that's definitely one way to change the subject.
 Yeah. Look. I don't know what the visions mean, Damon. It's just random snippets of Stefan and me living in some alternate reality.
 Um...
 Where's Liv?
 Perfect. A dead old guy with a mysterious, evil plan. I'll take that drink now.
 For our doppelgänger blood. The Travelers need it for some prophecy.
 Being drawn to them.
 What are youdoing out here?
 Damon.
 Damon, they're just visions. As soon as we find Markos, they'll stop.
 Look. I know we're in a little bit of a weird place right now. Hey. Look at me. The universe doesn't control anything. It's not real.
 You're really trying to pull off this chef thing.
 I always forget. Where do we put the opener?
 Yes.
 I don't have to.
 I love you, too.
 Did I just 
 He's here. I know where Markos is. 4620 Walnut Drive.
 The only thing I think she would have liked more would have been a wine of the day thing.
 Oh. I talked to Jeremy, and he's bringing a girl home this year.
 Hmm. I'm sure they'll both be lovely.
 Do you know that she bit him this morning?
 Stefan, don't encourage that.
 Oh, yeah? I'll bite you.
 Did you feel that, too?
 Does that mean that it's over?
 They weren't real.
 We weren't vampires, my parents were still alive. It was a fantasy, like a movie. It was the life that we never could have had.
 Amazing?
 I died.
 You couldn't cook.
 I will always love you, too.
 Do you think Damon and I will ever be able to talk like this, like friends?
 I just  I just wanted to say thank you. Whatever you did, it worked.
 It was paradise, actually.
 But you need to know. I saw a perfect life. Stefan and I were married, and we had kids. It was everything that we wanted.
 But it's not real. You and I, we're messy and complicated, but we're real.
 Yeah, but I still need you in my life.
 Damon 
 If that's what you want...
 Ok. Yeah. Ok.
 Breakfast, Professor Salvatore?
 What am I doing?
 Scientific methods can be used to understand human behavior.
 Thank you.
 Volunteering to help me study, the day after Damon declared that we can't be friends and that he never wants to see my face again. Speaking of distracting tactics.
 Just that Stefan's the tutor from hell.
 Actually, I'm surprised that you're up for studying, you know, considering...
 The other side... Falling apart. She's in denial.
 Yeah. Look, Bonnie. I've already lost you once. We're not doing this again. It's not an option, ok? Not to mention what's gonna happen to Alaric and your grams and everyone else over there. So what are we gonna do?
 He is?
 Damon said that he never wanted to see me again. I guess we're both in denial.
 Your elusive girlfriend from the Augustine days.
 What's going on?
 In 1960, were you 
 How did you compel everyone here?
 That was Maggie?
 Bonnie!
 Stop. You made your point.
 If you were gonna kill me, I'd be dead.
 I know how you're feeling.
 You're just lost. You think cutting all this out of your life is the answer, but you're just biding time until it all comes crashing back.
 Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just still a bit confused about how I got here.
 No. She never came back.
 Did you...
 Does Damon know?
 Ohh. Stefan, I don't know if I can 
 This is a terrible idea.
 We should have told him.
 Because Enzo's dead or because you killed him?
 No, no. We're just, um 
 So where's Damon now?
 Helping Luke or avoiding me?
 Well, technically, he said, "I don't want to hear your voice, and I don't want to see your face," because it's too hard for him.
 Really?
 Well, that was an extreme circumstance. Enzo almost killed me.
 Stop it. You're the least helpful person I know.
 Yeah. Caroline used to invite me here Before her parents split. Her dad could tell a pretty good ghost story.
 Have a little respect for the dead.
 Is that still what you want?
 Well, Luke did the cloaking spell. Stefan and Caroline are here, so we should be good... But if it's too hard for you to be here, then 
 Yes. No. I don't know.
 It's not a big deal.
 Hmm? No. Nothing. I just, uh  I just remembered that Stefan asked me to help him bring some firewood in, so I'll be right back.
 I lied to his face.
 Look. I know that we're doing this for Damon, but it still just sucks.
 And you think Damon is just gonna forget and move on?
 Cocktails. Good call.
 I'll help. Ahem.
 Yes!
 Yes!
 Oh, I don't think I'm drunk enough.
 Pbbb. Mean. Never have I ever been fooled by my evil doppelgänger while she was pretending to be me.
 Mm-hmm.
 Are you implying something?
 This just got weird. I'm officially buzzed, so I'm gonna go and get ready for bed.
 Damon!
 There was someone in here.
 I don't know. I didn't I didn't see anyone, But I could feel someone pushing me under the water.
 Damon.
 Maybe Luke  You're upset.
 I was worried that if Damon found out 
 I just didn't want to put you In an awkward position.
 Actually, yes, it was. Where did that even come from?
 Well, are you over it?
 Good. Now let's go find Luke.
 Damon.
 Hey.
 I will. I just came out to see how you're doing.
 So that's it? We're not gonna talk about this?
 I'm sorry that I lied to you.
 Ok. I'm confused. Why are you being like this?
 But you're still mad at me?
 Ok. Now I'm really confused.
 What was that for?
 Let me go
 Stefan...
 God. I feel like an idiot!
 Do that thing again; the vamp thing.
 Come on! It's the only thing keeping me sane right now.
 How many, uh, you know.. are we suppose to have before we get our strength back?
 This is just depressing
 No.. probably not more depressing than that.
 I'm sure he was thrilled about that.
 I like that voice. You know, maybe his whole thing is a sign.
 My blood can literally destroy him. If that's not a sign that we're in a toxic relationship...
 How come you are so much better at controlling it?
 I think I just hallucinated a unicorn.
 Ha. If Caroline was here, we'd have a fully catered buffet on the side of the road... and a rainbow.
 haha! That's funny. You know, when we were younger, I couldn't decide what was more annoying  The control-freakiness, or her delusional positivity. RIght now, honestly, there isn't a single person I wish was here more.
 Yeah, but you didn't have to build a barbie castle with her in second grade.
 We are so pathetic. You know what? Let's put on our best Caroline Forbes hat, shall we?
 Alright universe! Enough screwing around! We're ready for the good stuff!  Theme dance, or block party maybe?
 What?!
 Oh my god! That is so weird!
 See?
 Well, seeing as how he's permanently passengered into one of our best friends, yeah. This isn't a three person kind of truck, is it?
 We're not together
 So... you want your husband back. I get it, but didn't he run from Markos too? Doesn't that make you guys both dead?
 I don't mean to be rude, but would you mind if I drained your carotid a few ounces?
 What the hell is she doing?
 What? Did your magic sputter out?
 We trusted you!
 Stefan! Our rings aren't working!
 Our rings aren't working.
 Thanks. Between the four of us, that'll last a day.
 Are you okay?
 I had a really crappy day and I needed it. I thought I was never going to see you again and I couldn't think of a worse way to die
 Oh, my God. Stefan! She sits on the coffee table in front of the body.
 A little tip. If you're gonna flee the scene of the crime, take back roads.
 You mean the part where you try to kill a doppelgänger? There's no point. Stefan's already dead.
 Good because you're gonna help bring him back.
 They're not gonna have a chance to start again because in order to bring Stefan back, we're gonna have to kill them, a lot of them, including Markos.
 Yeah, don't forget about us.
 We should be there.
 We're not blowing up our town. We just need to lure enough Travelers to one spot.
 Hey. Did you find a Traveler that's going to get us out of here?
  Thank you, whoever you are.
 Got it. Well, I'm going to go call Damon, and let him know that we're ready.
 So are you good?
 Okay... wait—you? No. Damon, no! Absolutely not.
 Look at me, Damon.
 Do you see a future with me? Because that's all I see.
 Then don't go on a suicide mission!
 Well, what if something goes wrong?
 That was a low blow...
 You said to respect your choice and I did. Now, I need you to respect mine.
 I know what I signed up for, Damon and I'm all in.
 What are you staring at? Drive!
 Hurry! We have to die while we're still vampires, or..
 Damon...
 Bonnie!
 Yes!
 Did Damon?
 Oh my god! Alaric, what are you doing he—
 But what about Damon? I need to find him.
 I can't!
 Okay.
 I can't find Damon!
 No I'm not leaving without him!
 No!
 No! Bonnie! Why would you do that?! I can't leave without him!
 Are you okay?
 Oh my god. Liv!
 Bonnie! We need to find them. We need to start the spell again.
 Yeah, but Damon is on the other side, we have to—
 No.
 Please, don't leave me.
 Please... please... come back to me.
 He's gone...
 Uh.. a pulmonary angiogram provides a clear picture of the blood flow in the arteries of the lungs, which is what we look for in a pulmonary embolism; a condition in which Mr. Weatherly's symptoms are common.
 Thanks..
 Some of us are still getting the hang of the whole "drinking other people's blood" thing
 That's alright. I had some on the way over. You know... this will never not be weird.
 ... that you're my college professor now.
 It's the opening game of the season, Caroline. Time to come home.
 ... On the border of a town that doesn't want you. That's not home.. That's sad.
 No, but I like drinking in the parking lot beforehand.
 Caroline, I'm picking you up at 6 p.m. sharp tomorrow. Okay? Bring your school spirit. Bye!
 But I don't have to. Anyway... that was my day. How was yours?
 Sorry.
 Luke, hey.
 Oh, no, I'll be quick. Really quick. I just... I've been really thirsty lately. Do you think it's because of the... you know.
 Oh, obviously. I don't... I was just wondering if maybe you could, like, I don't know... Add something to the next batch?
 Luke, it was your idea that I see him again, remember? You were all, Hey Elena, I'm sorry that I wronged you. I'm sorry that I'm the reason your boyfriend is dead, remember?
 Yeah, I know.
 Right...
 Luke, I'm fine. I'm okay, I promise. Just come by my place by 5, okay?
 Thank you.
 Why isn't Jeremy answering his phone?
 Doing homework? Put me on speaker, please. Jeremy, I know you can hear me. Get your butt off that couch and do something productive.
 Or I'll have the sheriff arrest you and drag you to the town border, where I will kick your ass myself. Matt, a little help, please.
 Thank you. (she hangs up)
 Hey. You're home. I thought you were coming over at 5.
 Is it because I told you that I was thirsty? It's fine. I can get more at the blood bank at the clinic. I work there. It's easy.
 Yeah.
 No, you're my friend. My frind in spite of the fact that my boyfriend got stuck on the Other Side...
 Because you decided to stop the spell that could bring him back. My friend that owes me.
 I know you have more.
 Where is it?
 Where is it? I need to see Damon, Luke, and I'm not asking.
 I kind of want to set up Ric How long do you think it takes after somebody comes back to life before they can start dating again?
 So, like, 3 months?
 You know, if I had to drive around with everyone that I've lost, I'd need a school bus. (smiles)
 Can we not talk about it?
 Technically, you were dead when we met.
 Damon, please, don't say that.
 Yeah. Ok. (turns up music)
 I thought I had— guess not. What's this?
 Hey. Are you okay?
 Hang on. I can help.
 Where you heading?
 I'm still hungry.
 I got it, Damon. I'm gonna let her go. I'm just— I just need a little more.
 Caroline. It's not 
 No!
 It's fine. I've compelled everyone else.
 The what?
 The herbs... Luke's been giving me. They make me so thirsty. I am not thinking straight.
 They make me see Damon. I can talk to him, and, and I can be with him, and -
 I tried to grieve him, Caroline. Trust me, I know grief. I've got grieving down to a science at this point, and I tried. But every time I let it sink in that I'm never gonna see him again, I feel like I'm gonna die.
 Like what? Like dropping out of school and having picnics with my mom, near the town border? Or maybe I could pull a Stefan and bounce from country to country, chasing some false hope that we're gonna find a way to bring Damon and Bonnie back. We're all getting through it. This is me, getting through it, okay?
 What am I doing?
 Stefan, is that you? I know it's been a really long time since we talked, but...
 I need you to tell me that you found something. A witch. A guy who knows a witch who knows something. Anything. I need you to give me hope and tell me that you're gonna find Damon and bring him back.
 But how do you do it? How do you wake up in the morning? How do you go about your day without falling apart? Tell me what you're doing to get through this, because I'm clearly doing it wrong.
 No, there's only forever. That's why I need you to give me hope. Because I don't think I can live forever without him.
 You just said that you were looking for him.
 What do you mean you stopped?
 You can't be here.You're not even real. It's just my subconscious making me see what I want to see.
 You know I want to see you, Damon. But it makes me reckless. I hurt people.
 I never got to say thank you.
 For saving Stefan and... For bringing back Alaric and Tyler. Thank you.
 No, I'm not done yet. I... I want to thank you for giving me everything I always wanted. A love that consumed me. And passion. Adventure. There's nothing more I could ever want other than for it to last forever, but... It can't. This is the last time I'm gonna see you. This is good-bye, Damon. I love you. I have to let go.
 I... no. I... I said good-bye, Damon.
 No. I told you. That was the last time, Damon. I... I'm done.
 Stop it, Damon. Stop it, stop it. You're getting in my head. Don't do this. Please.
 No!
 Do you like being a vampire?
 Because with all the funerals and the start of the year... We never really talked about how you're dealing with all this.
 I meant the blood lust. The heightened emotions and immortality.
 Me, too. At least I did. Then one day, I discovered the good part. You know... The promise that love could be eternal. And I had that with Damon. Which means for the rest of eternity, I'm gonna have a hole in my heart where he's supposed to be.
 I know how death works, Ric. Trust me. I have done it. A lot. There's no such thing as moving on. It's a lie. So, if I'm ever going to be able to fall in love again, and make eternity bearable, I need you to do something.
 You were created by the original vampire spell, which means you can compel other vampires. And since I can't take away my vampirism, I want you to take away Damon. I want you to compel me to forget that I ever loved him.
 Missing Bonnie, makes me sad, Jer. Missing Damon makes me dangerous. Alaric will compel away any memories and then make me forget that I had him do it. I need you to keep the truth from me too. Tyler and Stefan are on board.
 Somehow I doubt she'll take much convincing.
 Talk me through it again?
 Can't you just compel me to forget everything at once? Or we can go get a beer?
 I will answer everything honestly.
 Yes. But I know I have to do this.
 More sad than afraid.
 Because I don't want to stop loving him.
 I trust you completely.
 He was my boyfriend, I loved him and he died.
 I was in high school.
 No, I'm Elena.
 There was something different about him, dangerous. But not in a way that scared me. He was exciting.
 What?)
 Like anything was possible.
 Stranger, two people passing in the night.
 Hmm, yeah let's just keep going.
 I told him it was wrong.
 He was my boyfriend.
 I loved him, and...he he died.
 You're the last person I think would object to me erasing positive memories of Damon from my head.
 Then Alaric will bring back my memories.
 But what? Go ahead, Caroline say what you need to say. I don't want to...pressure you into agreeing.
 And?
 Look, I think it's great that you still have hope, I really do but for my own survival I need to let him go.
 I love you.
 It was the Miss Mystic Falls pageant. Stefan was supposed to be my escort but...
 I was embarrassed but I got over it.
 He was my boyfriend, I loved him and he died. Ric, I hate this. I mean, wha ? How much longer is it going to take?
 Well, that's easy. It was after I found out about the sire bond. Everyone kept telling me that my feelings weren't real but I knew that they were.
 He was my boyfriend 
 I-I- I don't know, okay I maybe it was when we spent the night at the motel together, I wasn't back together with Stefan yet and 
 And all I could think about was kissing him.
 I wanted to kiss him so badly.
 He was my boyfriend 
 I don't know, Ric!
 Maybe we should just forget about this entire thing, it was a stupid idea, okay I-I can't do this anymore, alright? I'm done. I'm sorry.
 Luke, where are you? I need more of that stuff like now, I'm starting to go  I don't want to hear it, Ric, okay? We tried, it didn't work. It's over.
 I wasn't are you crazy?
 I was being completely honest. Do you think I want to talk to you about my romantic life?
 I did everything 
 I stuck with him, even when he lost his humanity 
 After he left a trail of bodies from Florida to Virginia, I fought for him.
 No, I loved Stefan. The entire time, I never would have hurt him.
 It was the necklace that Stefan had given me, I'd lost it.
 My necklace.)
 What it meant about my feelings for Stefan. Even though he loved me.
 Do it.
 I'm sure, just take it away, please. (Tears are streaming down her face.)
 Jeremy. Damon killed Jeremy, he snapped his neck right in front of me.
 I am good, I had a good day. I ditched all my classes and hung out with Ric, and we um...we talked about Bonnie.
 I had a good cry, and I don't know I I really feel like things are taking a turn for the better. So get your ass down here and let's have some fun.
 Sounds perfect, love you.
 So I uh, volunteered at the hospital until like two. And then I figured we could carpool to the party at the swimming hole. Um, normally when you move back in you unpack.
 Momentary moment?
 Are you sure you don't want to come back to school?
 Caroline, needing your friends isn't a weakness, momentary or otherwise.
 What?
 You guys go on one road trip and all of a sudden you're breakfast buddies?
 Come on, I got Matt to take the afternoon of from his training and Tyler to give the practice squad a break, even Jeremy is coming. It's been forever since we've all been together, it'll be fun.
 Cause I will selfie bomb you. Every five minutes.
 Yay. (She picks up the tray of coffees.)
 That is a conversation to be had over jello shots.
 Hey cutebrag.
 Hey, I didn't come up with it. Another one of the volunteers did.
 What? Sometimes, you brag. At least it has cute in it.
 Brag.
 Just come.
 Wha for the record, four months is far too long for me to go without seeing you.
 Yeahh..Apparantly this colordisguises all bodily fluids that i get covered in throughout the day. So far its been only observation but i don't know..i love it there. Seeing sick people getting better..it's inspiring.
 And you? Are you happy?Caroline told me a little bit.
Which is an incredibly insensitive thing to say to somebody who just lost their brother.I'm..I'm sorry.
 Ohh she'll be there at the swimming hole today. You should come.
 Stefan they're your friends too. C'mon. I know that we can't hang out at the Grill anymore. But that does'nt mean we can't all spend time together. C'mon please. If not for that then atleast to convince Caroline that Enzo is not new best friend replacement material.
 Yeah..but i can easily uninvite him. I'd rather you come. (Stefan cuts in)
 Great.
 She's determined but sweet, eternal optimist, never forgets a birthday. What else?
 Yes. True. She's completely loyal.
 That's another one. Great at surpassing expectations.
 Totally.
 Us? No. I'm... we're... heh. We're not, but, I mean, we did at one point...
 Has it already been two years?
 Damon
 Swimming hole. Thanks for making me sound like a redneck. Why? Where did you party in High School?
 Yup. Now it's my turn to brag because I bet nobody at your pool parties could do this.
 Ahem. Um, ahem. Jeremy?
 Sorry to interrupt what I'm sure was a heartfelt display of true love, but I'm Jeremy's sister, and we were about to have a nice little family chat.
 You invited the girl that I attacked?
 Jer, why would you even risk it?
 He said he was here to apologize.
 Hey. Have you guys seen Stefan?
 You don't remember this place? We used to sneak off here and get wasted while our parents were outside grilling. Granted, we all have a few less parents, but we can still have fun. ( She offers them Jello shots)
 Ok. Well, I don't want to sound like an alcoholic, but I do want a shot, so will someone do one with me?
 Bottoms up.
 (Realising that Caroline is being sarcastic)Ok. Clearly, this was a big mistake. I just wanted to spend one afternoon where we pretend for just one second like we're not all drifting apart. ( She goes and sits besides Caroline)
 What's going on?
 I'm still here, Car.
Here take another shot and...(She realizes Caroline has already walked away)
 Ok. Not so much.
 So you're sure you're ok to find your way back home? Sorry. My friend Caroline's having a bit of a crisis. It's been a rough couple of months for her. She's normally really sweet.
 Heh. Kissing a girl who's trying
 No. Why?
 I think you'll live, Jer.
 Knows what I am.
 Okay, well, Caroline and I will go out and search her at the border then.
 Yeah, of course.
 Is this an official unpack? Because your moving method is so confusing.
 ... Bonnie's? Yeah. There we go. You just discovered my secret of moving on  Sometimes I don't.
 ... Stefan?
 Caroline, you and Stefan ... did you have feelings for him or something?
 No, Caroline and I combed the border of Mystic Falls three times already. No sign of Sarah.
 This is bad, Stefan. Her compulsion went away as soon as she crossed the border. She knows that Caroline and I are vampires.
 Where do you think you're going?
 Savannah is not your home, Stefan. It's an escape, a hiding place. This is your home.
 So, you're just going to throw in the towel and go back to your fake new life?
 By pretending like your life here never existed?
 But I'm not buying it. You lost your brother. There's no way that you're fine.
 Show me. Prove to me that your system works. If I believe that you actually are happy, then I'll let you go. But if I don't buy it, which I probably won't, I will keep harrassing you until you come home. And, I'm talking about, like, Enzo-sized harassment.
 Deal?
 Well, we can't step foot into Mystic Falls. So now, it's up to Matt and Jeremy.
 She's cute.
 I'm sorry.
 Stefan? Health insurance?
 Ah, okay. So, no vampire privileges, no baggage, nothing from our old lives whatsoever, huh? What's this?
 Yeah, your brother really did love to torture people with nicknames. And just plain torture people...
 So, your system for moving on requires both burning bridges and a dead-end job.
 Paying your utilities?
 Alright, Let see what you got.
 Caroline's laying low at the dorm. No sign of Sarah yet, which means she's either hiding out, or she's planning her Nightly News exclusive to out me.
 Right.
 Ready. (she takes a shot of liquor)
 What?
 Okay.
 Yes.
 So, according to Caroline, Sarah's still M.I.A., and now Enzo's missing.
 Dumbest lie I've ever told. Can I just take that one back?
 But, when I first met you, you said you'd been away from Mystic Falls for fifteen years. What made you come back ahead of schedule?
 So, then why auto mechanic for 200 bucks a week?
 Yeah, it must be hard. All that change without a constant in your life. We haven't talked about your brother.
 What else would I call him?
 Anymore? What does that mean?
 Who cares what people think, right? To change.
 So, if we were to run into each other in some random town in thirty years, do we pretend like we're strangers?
 Bye, Stefan.
  What the hell are you doing?
 I forgot my jacket. Stefan, what happened with that guy?
 Letting somebody kick your ass so that you can feel?
 You're not alone in your grief, Stefan. I lost Bonnie when you lost Damon, but I fought through it.
 Believe me, that's not what it is.
 I know that he's your brother, I get it. But why inflict so much pain to yourself for such a hateful person? He doesn't deserve your grief. I mean, there's gotta be another way that you can move on.
 No one's forgetting him.
 What are you talking about?
 I don't believe anything that you're saying. Why would I do that?
 Wow. Oh, God, what? No. No. Stefan, how can I possibly love Damon?
 How could you obliterate an entire chapter of my life?
 Can you hold on to that? And keep it safe, in case I ever need to read it again?
 You know, that cautionary tale would have had more of an impact on me about two weeks ago.
 Why do you say, "yet," as if I'm gonna wake up one day and realize that my life is over if I don't have the traumatic memories of loving a serial killer?
 You know, maybe you're right. Maybe I am making a huge mistake, or maybe I got a very valuable piece of advice from myself about how to be happy and I intend on taking it. Am I gonna see you at the party tonight?
 Come on, Ric. You are like one hoodie and 3 missed haircuts away from becoming Professor Shane.
 You're hiding. You're becoming a self-loathing vampire hermit. Tell you what. You've been given the chance to start over. Take it. Be happy.
 Exactly. I'll see you at 8 00 but not in that t-shirt. You've worn it twice this week.
 There you are, good.
 Are you going out tonight?
 Sarcasm. What an unexpected response. I think you should come to the corn maze with me.
 Mm-hmm.
 Hilarious. You know, there's an actual scientific word for why people go to these events.
 Fun. Do you feel like having some with me?
 That depends. Are you gonna kiss me out of the blue again?
 I got to go. More people to invite.
 I'm inviting multiple people to join in on the fun. As for who my date will be, well, that depends on you.
 I invited her (she leans forward, scrunching her nose secretly) it's kind of a setup, only neither party knows about it.
 Come on. It's time to get your Kansas on.
 Oh, I think I recognize this scarecrow.
 Okay, well then, we are officially lost.
 Oh. Competitive type. Got it.
 Honestly, no...
 But people can change, right?
 What?
 Actually, he died.
 No.
 Yeah. It's ok, it's ok. His name was Damon, but... tonight isn't about him, it's about you and me.
 See, I told you it would be fun.
 Oh god, h-ho-how bad is it?
 I got this.
 I'll do everything that I can, j-just go see if you can help someone else, alright?
 Come on. GO.
 Listen to me, you dove out of the way just in time. You were very lucky. Now get out of here and take as many people as you can, ok? Come on.
 Tyler?
 What?
 Tyler you don't understand, you drove right through the maze, there are injured people everywhere.
 Ah, just... listen. Just hang on. Um, make sure that you keep him awake. Assess his injuries while I go find Jo and Alaric.
 Dr. Laughlin, my friend Tyler, he's in trouble, and its sounds really bad, and... I don't know where he is.
 Ok.
 Hey. The ambulances have arrived. Jo said to let the paramedics take it from here.
 Her windpipe, it's...
 Liam, I can help.
 Have you ever done this before?
 No, Liam. That's not what I meant. I can actually...
 It worked. You actually did it.
 I don't know. Beginner's luck?
 And she didn't. There are crazy, mysterious things in the world, I mean, some things science can't explain.
 Ok. Um... Why does a baby take its first breath?
 You asked me what my type is. You were a hero tonight, an absolutely jaw-dropping and out-of-this-world hero. That's my type.
 How?
 What about Bonnie?
 Where is "there," exactly?
 I don't want to see him.
 You're unkillable.
 What do you think is going to happen when I do see him?
 He's a psychotic killer!
 I don't see anything that could balance out the bad. Promise me you wont lift the compulsion. Promise me!
 Thank you
 I have to go. I have a shift at the hospital.
 Since Damon came back, and I'm trying desperately to avoid him.
 What do you mean, "it didn't take?"
 Okay. Yeah, I will. Will you call Jeremy? I had to tell him about Bonnie over the phone. You can imagine how that went.
 Who is it?
 I can't. Not now.
 Those feelings are gone.
 I know, I know. I panicked. I don't know...
 Look. I get how I'm supposed to feel, but I know how I actually feel, and I'm happy now. What if I look at him and my old feelings break through the compulsion?
 Stefan, I kissed Liam last night.
 Because he's gonna kill him, right? Just like he killed my brother!
 I know, but I just don't think eventually can be today, all right? I got to go. (She hangs up, shoves the phone in her pocket and quickly walks toward the cart, lifting the lid off the coffee before she quickly takes a sip. She's surprised when she realizes it has no vervain in it, but when she sees Jo about to return, she quickly puts the coffee back and tries to play it cool).
 Hey...
 Yeah, no... I changed my schedule around.
 I like your bracelet. What is it made of? (She goes to touch it, but Jo jerks her hand away as she grabs a chart. Elena awkwardly pulls her hand back and rubs the back of her neck, trying to cover up what she was trying to do)
 Sure, yeah!
 Where is she?
 I don't get it...
 Yeah, you know, um, I think Liam was exaggerating how bad off she was. It was dark, and, yeah, there was a lot of blood 
 How did you know?
 So, what are you?
 That's it? You're gonna let me stay?
 You're a witch.
 Deal.
 Yeah, I figured that I'd press the Damon button and see what happened.
 I don't know. I don't even know what I'm doing. I just  I'm thinking we should meet face-to-face. I can't run from you forever, so... come by my dorm?
 Okay
 Damon!
 I want my memories back.
 I made up my mind. If Damon survives this, then I want Alaric to un-compel me. I mean, I can't imagine ever loving him, but I also can't ignore the parts I don't like just to avoid the truth. I mean how could I make any decisions if I only know half the story? (Caroline rubs her arm affectionately, and they turn to face the road ahead of them, waiting for Tripp's arrival).
 Stefan? Stefan, what's happening?
 Oh, my God.
 I was just on Route 9, and there was a crash, but they weren't there.
 What happened?
 What, Caroline? What?
 So he's okay? That means he's okay, right?
 Then why do you have that look on your face? What happened, Caroline?
 What? I don't know what that means, Caroline.
 Jo's a keeper. How does it feel?
 Well, it's too bad there aren't any vampires in Mystic Falls to help heal you.
 No, no, no, Alaric. I'm just glad that you're okay. I mean, up until an hour ago, I didn't even want my memories to return. I was the one who made the choice to lose them. Now I have to live with the fact that you can't give them back to me. I know how much you hated being a vampire, so I'm just glad one of us got what we wanted.
 To be able to look Damon in the eye, knowing all that I know and all that I don't, and see how I feel about him. I want to trust how I feel.
 I'm not sure what to say.
 I remember...pain.
 I remember all the terrible things that you did to the people I care about.
 I honestly don't remember anything good between us.
 I thought if I saw you in person it might change everything but...
 Damon, I know that I loved you.
 And I know that apparently I forgave you for all of the awful things that you did.
 But I just don't remember it. I'm sorry, I just don't...feel it anymore. I'm sorry.
 Damon, I-I really am sorry.
 I felt scared and guilty, and his eyes were really, really blue and pretty, but... no. I don't remember loving him.
 That's your advice?
 True.
 Bye.
 Hello to you, too.
 You're still obsessing over that.
 Wow! She must have been really drunk.
 When do volunteers have access to the patient labs?
 Yeah? Well, we have to go. Jo said that it's mandatory.
 Is that another one of your conspiracy theories? Super soldiers take over the world to carry out vicious fundraising schemes?
 When I win my trip to Fiji, you don't have to come.
 Oh. Ok. Maybe you can come.
 Can you grab us a couple drinks?
 Sorry. I didn't know that you were here.
 You know, um, it doesn't matter, whatever you want.
 Right. Yeah, um, that is what I... What I told you. Obviously, that's not true.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 Damon.
 I hate Chardonnay.
 What are you doing?
 Why are you doing this?
 You're trying to stir up memories. This isn't a good idea.
 Look. I'm here with someone, Damon. You can't just come unannounced and ruin my night.
 I know, but look. Do you want me to feel guilty? Because trust me, Damon. I do, ok? I feel horrible, and I'm sorry, but I don't... I don't know what to tell you. What do you want me to say? I don't remember us.
 I need some air.
 I want to remember.
 I mean, I want to try. Knowing that there's this whole piece of my life missing, it's... it's driving me crazy, ok? So I have to at least try to get it back.
 I know there's nothing we can do about the compulsion, but maybe if we unwind the memories backwards, something might trigger something, and maybe they'll all come back, right?
 Take me to the last place I told you I loved you.
 I don't remember being here with you that night.
 I remember that we had to stop the travelers.
 You had a plan, but you didn't tell anyone what you were doing, and the next thing I know, you're dead. I heard that you drove your car into the grill and then blew yourself up so that you could trigger some explosion.
 What?!
 Ok. Tell me more. Something happy?
 What else?
 Well, I did, so...
 This isn't working. I'm sorry.
 I am trying! I get that we had an amazing life together, and I know that I loved the fact that you were reckless and probably made me feel very free, but now when I look into your eyes, I just...
 I feel like... Like I'm looking at a stranger because I'm never gonna be able to give you what you want, because I just can't remember.
 I'm trying to undo the compulsion. It's the only way.
 I remembered something out there, just bits and pieces, but, um... There were these stars, and then it started to rain.
 It started to rain, and then what happened, Damon?
 What are you talking about?
 It started to rain, and then what?
 Hey. You're still talking to me. Sorry I ran out like that.
 What's this?
 No, no, no, wait. Just give it a second. It'll clear up.
 Promise me this is forever.
 I'm a vampire.
 I'm... a vampire. I mean, there's only so many ways you can say it.
 Or he'll keep digging, realize that I force-fed her my vampire blood, and then just bail.
 So lie, and lie – again, and again, and again.
 Jo.
 Where's Alaric?
 You can't miss Friends-giving. I mean, Matt and Jeremy are already cleaning up the whole Tripp mess, and Caroline's mom has to work. We're already low on friends as it is.
 What do you mean Bonnie's in the prison world? Damon said that she wasn't there, that she found peace with... Why didn't he tell me this?
 Bonnie's still alive? Oh, my God!
 This is amazing.
 Wait. What...
 Liam, hey. You're here.
 Getting there.
 Come on.
 Would you mind?
 Thanks.
 Hey. Um, did you...
 Yeah. Thank you.
 That kind of sounds like your voice.
 Hang on. You guys know each other?
 You knew Bonnie's grams?
 Kai? Wh... Kai as in Damon's Kai?
 Oh, my God. Liam... Is still here.
 Yeah.
 OK. I think I may have missed something. If you and Liv can both be the leaders of your coven, why did she just get so upset?
 Damon's gone, as in into thin air?
 I don't have feelings for him anymore. That doesn't mean I want him to blink out of existence.
 And to think we could have all been sitting around stuffed, playing board games.
 Friend code states that in matters such as yours and Caroline's I must, with no exception, take the side of my best friend.
 Can you two just kiss and make up? It's getting weird.
 How did you know that you could trust me?
 When you were honest with me about what you were. How did you know that you could trust me with such a huge secret?
 Jo? Are you OK?
 Jo, what's wrong?
 Jo, what the hell is going on?
 Ric?
 Something's happening to Jo. You have to find her dad and stop him from whatever he's doing to her.
 Invite him in.
 You have to get more ice.
 She's crashing!
 Jo, can you hear me? Jo!
 I don't know.
 Liam... Liam, there's not enough time.
 It's OK. My blood will heal her.
 Jo?
 I'll get you some water.
 I'm a vampire.
 It doesn't matter, because as much as I like you, my life is complicated enough. So you're not gonna remember anything from tonight or about Lady Whitmore or the fact that we even dated at all. You're gonna go home, get some rest, and I'll see you at work on Monday.
 You should have brought me with you. Well, first, you should have told me that Bonnie was alive, and then you should have brought me with you.
 Yeah. I deserve that.
 So you and Bonnie spent the last 4 months together?
 What did you do?
 Yep. I know this is gonna sound pretty strange, but I'm really happy that the two of you had each other.
 What did you talk about?
 I broke up with Liam.
 What do you think? Look. I'm at a crossroads right now, where I could go live my life the way I think I probably should and be successful and safe and probably very happy, or I could risk all that for this tiny glimmer of a feeling inside that I just can't shake.
 I don't know... But I do know someone who could give me some pretty sound advice.
 Any chance you'd be willing to help me bring my best friend Bonnie back? So, I could ask her?
 Two weeks without booze doesn't make you Iron Man. I can still vamp circles around you.
 Ha! Or I could pants you in front of the entire women's volleyball team.
 Ok. I give up. What did you do with my miserable half-drunk brother?
 It's about Bonnie.
 He thought Kai had killed her, but he just found out that she's alive, and he's doing everything that he can to 
 No. No, no, no, Jer. It's not hollow. Liv's looking for a way to send us over there so that we can find Bonnie and bring her back.
 Jer, this is good news.
 What does Matt want with Stefan?
 She told me a little while back, and whatever you're thinking, I want both of them to be happy.
 Hey. Thanks for doing this.
 Why?
 And how do we get back?
 I used to come here every day after the accident for months.
 Yeah, but not in 1994. In 1994, they were still alive.
 Yeah.
 Bonnie?
 No, and I looked in every room plus the basement.
 Damon, you you don't think that Kai...
 Ok.
 Oh, my god. Damon.
 Oh, my god, Damon. This is blood.
 What are you doing?
 So you're gonna call him?
 I know what a pager is. 
 And now what?
 Um...
 Oh. Hey! What was that?
 That was a video journal.
 Then why did you say you thought this was your own personal hell?
 Damon.
 Bonnie?
 Yes! It's me. I'm here. I'm at the Salvatore house in...in 1994.
 It's a long story. Just know that I'm here to get you.
 So Kai just left you in Portland?
 Where is he now?
 Hang on. You hotwired a car? Who are you?
 Liv's pulling us out in 7.
 You're coming home. We'll see you soon.
 You're worried about Kai.
 Hang on.
 What?
 Ok. Who mangled the crossword?
 This is about Kai and Jo.
 If Kai's out, he's gonna go after Jo again. Damon, he's gonna kill her.
 Then why would she give you the Ascendant?
 It was the one thing trapping Kai, and she just gave it to you?
 Damon.
 Alaric stole from her.
 Of course you compel your best friend. I mean, why would that be off limits?
 Oh, just just no. Don't. Damon, I want Bonnie back more than anything. She's my best friend, but to you, she's something else, isn't she? She's a chance for me to realize what a great guy you are so that I can fall in love with you all over again. It doesn't matter who gets hurt in the process as long as Damon gets what Damon wants.
 Damon and Bonnie. Who would have thought?
 She's probably passing Whitmore right now.
 You know, I could have sworn that this used to squeak.
 It's funny. I used to have so many good memories of this house, and after just one bad one, I burned it down. I just couldn't bear to look at it again. I just can't believe it's gone.
 Yeah. Yeah, I do.
 I'm sorry I compelled away the memories. They were only half mine.
 Do you feel that?
 No. No. We shouldn't be back yet. Damon, we have another hour.
 What did you do?
 No. Send me back first.
 Bonnie was on her way. Send me back!
 No. No.
 Bonnie's gonna get to the house, and we will be gone.
 No!
 Jeremy?
 She was on her way, but 
 Unh!
 You know you just declared war, right?
 No. I'm watching you drool all over Ric's textbooks, and considering you're already on his bad side...
 Time for Ric to get a new reference library. We've been looking all night. I swear I haven't found anything that even remotely resembles an Ascendant.
 Nope.
 It's just... Everything you've been doing for Bonnie. Thank you.
 Hello, Ric.
 No, not since yesterday.
 So I asked around the hospital. No one's seen Jo since last night at the ER. A bunch of stab victims came in, and one of them's missing, as well.
 Guys, if Kai has Jo, we need a plan.
 Kai was born without the ability to do magic.
 Ric's right. Even if Kai can't do the locator spell, he's gonna make it his mission to find it.
 Why aren't you more concerned?
 Well, maybe you'll meet a cute surfer.
 Nowhere. Bonnie's dad is dragging her on a work trip, so I'm gonna ask my parents if she can spend the holiday with us.
 Yeah. The 3 of us have never spent Christmas apart. I plan on keeping it that way, even though Jeremy will hate it. It's always fun to torture him.
 Hey!
 What happened?
 And when was the last time you ate, Caroline, as in fed?
 Not good. Damon and I spent the night researching.
 I don't know. It's probably better that she doesn't know, though.
 I know what you're thinking, and no.
 You're clearly malnourished.
 Caroline could really use whatever's in that cup.
 Is it just me, or does that look really bad for somebody who just fainted?
 Glioblastoma? No, but that... no. No, no.
 No, but that doesn't make sense, Stefan. Caroline would have said something.
 What's going on with Liz Forbes?
 C-can you operate?
 But that would mean... Does she know?
 Are you ok?
 I know.
 I know. I should tell her. It's only a matter of time before she compels a doctor, and I don't want her finding out from a stranger, you know?
 No, Stefan. You don't have to.
 He got you a snow globe?
 Looks like someone is missing the true meaning of Christmas. Come on. We're happy and healthy, and we're together.
 I'm at the medical center. Where are you? Reception's horrible. Damon, can you hear me?
 You mean home home?
 Let's just celebrate the fact that we can go home. I could really use some happy news right now. Today sucked.
 So look. I don't know what we were or are or what we're supposed to be, but all I know is that today was pretty horrible, and I just... I want to see you. I have something I need to tell you.
 Mistletoe. Clever.
 Damon, what are you doing?
 Are you gonna let me in or...
 Um... heh.
 Why am I here?
 I don't mean the Mystic Grill
 Why am I here, Kai?
 What the hell is wrong with you?
 (gasps and scoots back in her chair, horrified)
 We're in my high school?
 Again?
 Kai, you don't have to do this. Listen to me, you don't have to do this.
 Ow!
 Stop!
 My ring. Kai, you're melting my ring.
 Kai, stop it!
 No, no, no, no. No, no, no. No. No.
 Damon, Kai has me at the high school. I need your help.
 Nice shirt.
 So you can care about an inanimate object, but not the people that you kill?
 Have you really not cared about anyone?
 If the spell that you're going for is to creep me out, it's working.
 Ow. What are you doing?
 How are you here right now?
 My ring, it's gone. Kai melted it into nothing.
 Well, there's the tunnels under the school.
 You okay?
 There must be another splinter still stuck...in my heart. (Elena's breathing is labored)
 If there's any-anything you need to say 
 Now's the time.
 Oldest trick in the book.
 I've never felt more alive.
 So, um, assuming that I don't get kidnapped before tomorrow, maybe we can, um, try for that dinner again?
 Are you gonna keep sulking or are you gonna let me take you to dinner?
 You invented a stain remover?
 Calculator, calculator. Where is the calculator? Of course. Under the catatonic serial killer.
 Hey.
 I can't. I'm late for my volunteer shift at the hospital. (takes a bite of the sandwich Damon is holding out to her)
 Oh, yeah. Jo made me a new daylight ring. You like?
 Well, I'm here, aren't I?
 I know everyone has their doubts about Jo's magic, but she has an entire month to get stronger and win the merge with Kai, so a little bit of support wouldn't kill anybody.
 Look, Alaric's gone out of town to get some mystical thingamabob to give Jo an edge, and your job is to baby-sit Kai, not smother him with a pillow.
 And if he starts twitching or something, just give him 50 milligrams of pentobarbital.
 And I happen to have a weird eggplant obsession.
 Great. (smiles)
 I don't speak French, Damon.
 Damon, that's cheating, okay? You already know everything about me.
 I'm serious. Look, if we're going to do this, then we can't just pick up where we left off. Because I don't remember where that is.
 At the beginning. I'm off at six; you can pick me up then.
 Fine.
 Great.
 Bye.
 Should I call it?
 Well, in the magical win column, I just walked across campus without bursting into flame. So, there's that.
 Any news?
 Did you know that Caroline was going to give her mom vampire blood?
 And then you left and then he died, so it didn't actually heal him; it did the opposite.
 Yeah, but you didn't, Stefan. You're what? Like 165-years-old? You worked as a paramedic at hospitals...
 I just wish that you'd done a little bit more research. Or waited like, a day.
 Hey.
 I don't know. Jo's still running some tests to find that out. She should be out in a minute.
 Yeah.
 I can see how much you care about her, but we all do. So if there's anything we can do to fix this, trust me, we will.
 Caroline, where are you? Call me. Or better idea, just...just come back.
 Hey.
 How are you feeling?
 We're not sure yet, I mean, Jo's still doing some tests.
 They thought it was slow down the cancer cells from replicating. But it didn't work. I'm sorry.
 She's good. She just ran out to get some food.
 She just took off. And now I can't find her; I can't get ahold of her.
 Hey. I'll make sure that we find her. I promise.
 You're not a doctor, so stop playing games. Because I am a vampire and I will rip your head off if you screw this up.
 I have no idea.
 I'm gonna let Damon explain.
 I'm staying with you.
 Sheriff, hey. How are you feeling? Are you okay?
 Oh, my God. I think she's having a heart-attack.
 Kai, you have to fix this!
 Stay with me, Sheriff. Just...breathe!
 It's her heart. I'm losing her, Damon.
 So find one! Now!
 I-I don't know. Maybe I think it was a minute. It feels like an hour.
 No, no. I will not let this happen. Wake up!
 Come on.
 I need some air or some water or something. 'Cause...she almost died in my arms, Damon. Caroline's mom almost died in my arms.
 I don't care. Life's too short. Immortal or not, I don't want to waste another minute.
 Hey. You want to ugh... give me a hand, please?
 Ok. Fine. Then you are on decoration duty. It's Bonnie's birthday.
 Then you know how she would
 Or we could celebrate you
 Jer, I've seen your
 Hey.
 (takes of her jacket and sees
 It's worth the risk. (takes a
 You know, we never talked
 Right. Well, I just wanted
 Yeah. We we're good. Really
 Pretty much.
 No. That's
 Why would we give a letter to
 Why would we help you, Kai?
 You
 You mean you cried.
 Actually, what if there's something
 I tried to fix it.
 I thought you were the
 Ok. So we know that Jo stored

 Silas.
 I don't know. Silas was

 And what reminded
 Look. I'm not saying that we

 Probably?
 Will she be able to us or not
 (realizing where they are)
 What?
 Wait. Wait. What
 Bonnie is going
 We have to stop her. We have
 All right, but how do we open
 What? No.
 Jer.
 I didn't know you and Bonnie
 To you,
 I'm not, but do you ever
 It's just a question, Damon.
 "No" what?
 I'm gonna go check on Jer.
 Liv is trying to kill Kai.
 Oh,
 Jeremy, wake up. Jer, wake
 Bonnie, is she...
 I might be able to salvage a
 Jeremy, I know what you've
 Actually, I was gonna say
 I'll be fine. I promise. Just
 Don't be mean. He needs to
 Look.
 No, Damon. I don't care what
 Principal Weber, I know that graduation isn't for a few months, but Jeremy just got accepted into this great art school.
 What's wrong with it?
 Damon!
 No. Look. Jeremy has had a rough time here, I know, but that's part of the reason why we want him to go.
 We already compelled him into art school. Sorry that I wanted my little brother to actually get a degree.
 We helped the process along. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna get a drink. Jeremy  She ok?
 You know I'm a vampire, right, a big sister with nearly perfect senses who can sneak up on you without making a sound. Really sucks for you. Give it.
 Well, Damon is an idiot, and Alaric conveniently disappeared. So I can only yell at you.
 Right. That hadn't occurred to me. Our lives are so weird.
 Give me your lighter.
 Yes. I just decided that me smoking a joint with my little brother might be the most normal thing that we've done together in years.
 No way in hell.
 And it has to be mine?
 Oh, God, how many cars you think we've destroyed? Like, more than the average family, right?
 That SUV on my birthday.
 They really didn't give us many fries, did they?
 Hmm... Oh, my God, we're so busted.
 Dude, I am. Ha ha! Oh... it's official. I am the world's worst sister.
 I am. Mom and dad died, and what did I do? I let you be Jenna's problem because I couldn't deal. I shut you out. I shut everybody out.
 What, Damon? I'm bonding with my brother.
 I'm not so sure it's a good idea to be around a sheriff right now. Ha ha! Jeremy and I smoked your going-away present.
 No. I'm lightly buzzed.
 Ok. I'll walk over now. Whew. Hide the evidence. See you at home. Jeremy  Uh! Mm.
 Honestly, I don't remember why we took that route home, and I had no idea that there was luggage in the trunk.
 I was texting with Bonnie when it happened. Embarrassing, I know.
 I wasn't home that night. You really think there's something up with my parents' crash?
 No. You took care of Jeremy and I. I remember. Poor Jenna was trying and failing, but you let us stay at your place. You took us to school, made us dinner.
 You really tried. Ha ha! Ha ha!
 I'll see if Jeremy knows anything.
 Yeah.
 There you are. Oh, my God, what happened?
 Are you kidding me? Sit down. I'm gonna kick his ass.
 She wanted to talk about the night that mom and dad died. She thinks something else happened, like maybe it wasn't an accident.
 Mom had called her a couple of hours before the crash. She left an urgent message asking her to call back. Think. Do you remember anything out of the ordinary about that night? 
 
 Ah, you weren't supposed to hear that. Damon said that she's getting worse.
 No kidding, because the right time was a couple of years ago. Enzo could have killed you today, and the other day, Liv threw you across a room, and let's not forget the time that you actually died.
 You deserve a normal life, Jer. You deserve the life of a kid whose only baggage is that he lost his parents. Come on. Let's get you to the airport.
 Um... And in a couple days, expect an SUV-sized package from me.
 Just don't crash it, ok? (They hug, Elena Exhales)
 Where are we going?
 You drive. I sent my car to Jeremy.
 It's okay. I called him.
 Well, welcome to the world of awkward sympathies. That's why you have to be prepared with your responses. I recommend at least three.
 Your responses will be different for each category of people in your life  friends of circumstance, casual acquaintances, loved ones.
 Then talk to him about it tomorrow. You already have a lot on your plate.
 I'm worried about Caroline. I don't think she's handling this as well as she thinks she is. You're not done yet?
 Hey. Easy. You are nice... ish.
 This isn't about you, Damon. This isn't even about Liz. It's about Caroline and what she needs to hear. Okay? (kisses Damon on the cheek and leaves the room)
 Care. They're ready. Do you need a minute?
 Hey, are you leaving?
 I'll walk you home.
 I just don't think it's a good idea for you to be alone tonight, you know?
 You're welcome. But-
 I don't believe you. All day, something has been bugging me. You wanted to pack this all in so quickly like you had somewhere you needed to be. I mean, you were so concerned with getting through today without a hint of how you'd feel tomorrow. And then I realized. You don't want to feel tomorrow. That's the plan, right? You're not going to feel tomorrow because you're going it turn it all off.
 You listened to Damon?
 Better? Care, you're talking about flipping the humanity switch. There's nothing better about that.
 It's not gonna be different, Care. It's gonna be deadly. You saw what happened to me when I did it.
 You just mentioned two of the biggest mistakes that I ever made.
 And if Stefan had said the right thing earlier, would that have changed your mind? Yeah. I heard.
 No one should have to. It's not fair. It's not. I get it. I do. And I know you think that you have it all figured out, but please listen to me. I'm not gonna let you do this.
 It's like she never lived here. 
 So what? She just flips her humanity switch, came back to the dorm, took all of her clothes  
 Do you think she's trying to cut off all ties to her past?
 Okay, why are you getting mad at me? I'm not the one who did this.
 Okay, look. I'm just gonna look around campus, maybe someone's seen her just let me know if you find anything, okay?
 Oh, my god. Bonnie? 
 Oh!
 Suck it, 1994! 
 Okay.
 So, does that make you his muse? Because eww.
 Wait. You—you haven’t called him yet?
 
 Caroline! Um, you’re here.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Okay, not exactly the Welcome Home party I was planning for you but I think we should split up and look for Caroline.
 
 Did he have any bite marks on him?
 And he doesn't remember her feeding on him at all?
 
 Or she'll drink from the blood bags in our fridge that she just restocked.
 I'm just saying she hasn't actually hurt anyone, and there's no bodies that have shown up at the med center, no students are missing... What if she actually has this under control? You know, we give her her year, she's happy, and then 
 
 What's your plan?
 
 
 
 
 
 Look. I know that you can't feel it right now, Care, but if you kill Sarah, it's gonna haunt you forever. Trust me. I did it, and it sucks.
 
 He is not turning his humanity off.
 
 
 I can't find them anywhere. We're running out of time!
 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. Stefan! No! Stefan, no!
 
 
 
 
 
 Stefan, are you okay?
 Please don't tell me that you shut it off. 
 Damon. What are you doing?
 Yeah. Well, not to add to our growing pile of bad news, but we didn't just lose Stefan. We lost our chance to spark Caroline's humanity. Turns out, he was her emotional trigger. No thanks.
 Who is that?
 Your mother is alive?
 Your mother is alive.
 Damon, your mother is alive!
 How much of a mama's boy?
 This is our way to get Stefan back! You can't tell me that his mother isn't an emotional trigger.
 Think about it. If this works, we don't just get Stefan and Caroline back. We get your mother back. Aren't you even a little curious to see her?
 Is this presentable attire by 1903 standards?
 To meet the woman who gave birth to the two epic loves of my life? Me.
 But Kai just had the Ascendant. Why do we have to find another one?
 I don't want to leave you alone with him.
 Can we just take a second to acknowledge how insane it is that we're standing in the house that you grew up in? You were so adorable!
 Aw, you can give her another chance?
 Stefan was a Ripper. You never gave up on him.
 You've been in here for over a century...
 How did you end up here, Mrs. Salvatore?
 I don't know what to call her.
 That sounds miserable.
 The last memory Stefan has of you is a vision of an angel telling him "Everything is going to be okay."
 These vampires have been trapped here with you? The whole time?
 Or, maybe she feels responsible for them?
 Damon! Isn't this the Ascendant?
 Why isn't Bonnie here?
 Damon, look outside! Is that the Aurora Borealis?
 Yeah!
 Damon!
 You have her eyes.
 It's the only baby picture of my boyfriend in existence! Of course I brought it back.
 I liked seeing that side of you today.
 A mother's son.
 Look, I know that she's not the woman that you remember, but... give her some time!
 Well, I happen to know from experience that it's never a waste of time to look for the good in someone.
 Well, then it's a good thing we have forever!
 No, no, no, no, it's fine. I, um, I actually have to go check in on Ric to see how things are going with Stefan and Caroline, so...
 Do you smell something?
 Is that bacon?
 
 Have you seen my t-shirt?
 I'm not so sure your mom would feel the same way.
 Wow!
 
 
 It's Jo. Someone's been attacking people at Whitmore.
 That's exactly what I'm gonna find out. 
 He's unconscious, but I gave him some of my blood, and his vitals have stabilized.
 Yeah, I know. That's why I'm hoping that Damon and his mom find them soon.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You and Alaric are having a baby! I... 
 
 Actually, the reason why I'm not shocked is because I've been in their shoes, and I was just as bad. And this is all just one big, horrible reminder that there's always going to be a part of me that's capable of doing what they're doing.
 For a while, maybe, until little Stevie becomes teenage Steven and I haven't aged a day.
 
 
 I'm just happy for you and Alaric.
 He knows how I feel. But, he also knows that there's nothing we can do to change that, so there's no point in dwelling.
 
 
 Says the guy who pined for Katherine Pierce for over a century and a half!
 It's okay to feel hurt, Damon. She was the second woman to abandon you.
 
 
 Oh, my God! Matt! It's okay, you'll be fine.
 
 Matt!
 What just happened?
 
 Then why are you refusing my blood?
 
 
 
 
 Because, I think I was... I don't know.
 Yeah, a little. I mean, I've always wanted a family. Before, you know... So, it's kind of a bummer of a reminder that that's never gonna happen for me. 
 They're not, and I can't. Nothing's changed.
 
 
 
 But, that's not possible. Vampires can't be witches.
 So, do I need to remind you two that the last time Caroline thought that we were trying to flip her switch, she went on a killing spree?
 Fine, say she believes you  How do you know she's gonna even want to see you again?
 Okay, what am I missing here?
 Hang on a second. Did you and Caroline 
  Never mind...
 Yes.
 Caroline got rid of everything from her former life. Her mom had sent this letter, intending for it to arrive after she died, which it did, but Caroline had already flipped her switch.
 Oh! Um, ahem.
 Yeah. I can see that.
 Good news! Your shift's over. I'm here to relieve you.
 Supplies. Cards. Got it.
 Ric?
 It's really nice to see you happy.
 Phew. Okay.
 Knock, Knock.
 We really want you back, Caroline.
 I'm not here to preach to you, Caroline. I just came to show you this.
 This letter from your mom arrived at our dorm just a few days after her funeral. Apparently there was something she wanted to tell you.
 Stefan, don't! No!
 No!
 She burned the letter. That was my ace in the hole. I blew it.
 Well, at least Alaric and Jo can cross this off their list of honeymoon options.
 Mm-hmm. Jo's pregnant. They didn't want to have to fly anywhere.
 Of where I'd go on my fictional honeymoon before I give birth to my fictional baby? No. But not here.
 Really? What part of extreme floral patterns screams Elena Gilbert to you?
 Easy. With you.
 Okay. Uh, in a loft in Tribeca above the bar that you work at.
 Okay. You... You own the bar, and when you're not working there, you're... You're on the couch, pouring me wine and massaging my feet after a long day at the O.R. I'm in the surgical residency program.
 Yeah, of course, eventually, but we should, um, probably have two, you know, so they can keep each other company when we're, you know, distracted by other things. (They kiss)
 How about you? Your turn. Five years from now, where are you?
 Shut up, Caroline!
 I can't listen to this.
 I don't want to hear it, okay?
 Damon, Caroline's not right. I'm not settling.
 You said it yourself. If I was human, we wouldn't work.
 Why are you acting like this?
 What do you want me to say, Damon? You want me to say that I'm never gonna be 100% okay with being a vampire for the rest of eternity? Fine. But I'm okay with that, because then that means I get to be with you forever, and just the thought of that is good enough for me. Why isn't it good enough for you?
 I'll let you take that.
 Damon! Damon, is this...
 Is that true?
 So that whole five-years-from-now game, and all that talk about our future?
 I mean, I get it, but if I take this, everything changes. I just never thought I would see it again.
 Why not?
 Damon, it was just a stupid game.
 Then why would you keep it a secret from me for so many days and then try to have it destroyed?
 It's just... It's just too complicated. We're gonna give it to somebody else. Bonnie's mom, or Caroline.
 Fine. Then, I'm sure there's a long list of vampires who would give anything for a do-over.
 Well, I don't want it, Damon. I don't want to live without you either.
 What?!
 
 If Caroline were here, we would be planning a spa day.
 So, I figured we'd just stuff our faces.
 
 Right?
 Yeah, or mini-golf...?
 
 You do? 
 
 
 Damon Salvatore stands in front of you and tells you that he wants to become a human again. Wouldn't you freak out? 
 Yeah! 
 I said I would think about it. 
 What if I miss the perks, like compelling the owner of a diner to close early for us? Or what if I get sick?
 Speak of the devil.
 
 Very funny! You may have partied us under the table, but at least I'm on a junk food high.
 
 
 Want some?
 I love it up here.
 
 Did you mean it when you told me you'd take the cure? Or were you just afraid that you were gonna lose me?
 
 
 
 You only live once, right?
 Well, I guess if I had to choose one thing, it would be that I can heal people.
 Okay. Well, then, enlighten me!
 
 But, this isn't real. It's a fantasy. You put this in my brain.
 
 
 For you, there's no going back.
 And, you're impulsive! And reckless!
 I love you.
 I don't know. I... I kind of feel...
 It all looks so good 
 How about eggplant parmesan?
 Is that bad? 
 
 I think I'm... I'm okay.
 
 
 Yeah, well, wait...
 It's not healing. Damon, it's not healing. That means, it's... it worked. It worked!
 
 
 
 You don't want to feed on me.
 
 No. No!
 Ugh! Really? Come on!
 Focus.
 
 I remember everything. Every moment. It's like a million tiny, little pieces of my heart have fallen back into place. I remember the moment that we met, the moment that we fell in love... How much I didn't want to love you, but it was like... it was like, I was being swept up into a current. I-I-I was consumed by it.
 Damon, I remember everything! Every kiss, every conversation.
 We've already had this conversation, Damon. 
 Was it? Because I remember it like it was just yesterday.
 Take the cure with me. That's how much I know this is real. That's how certain I am that I'm gonna love you ever after this is all over. 
 You walked away from me because you didn't want me to change your mind, because you didn't want this.
 You haven't thought this through.
 You're so afraid of losing me that you've convinced yourself that you can endure a human life.
 Okay, fine. What about Stefan? What does he think?
 Damon, I love you more than I ever thought was humanly possible. I'm not trying to hurt you, but I can't let you do this.
 Not before you've let everyone in your life try to talk you out of it, including you.
 Up, up, up. Come on, no time to sleep in. We have to get Jo.
 Yeah.
 I hope so, considering she's walking down the aisle in t-minus ten hours. Come on Wedding bells await!
 What's wrong?
 Hey, hey. Come on. Don't waste all your panic now! You still have eight hours until the ceremony. Non-alcoholic mimosa?
 Cheers.
 Oh. oh! Jo's phone. Oh, huh. Okay.
 Danielle's got the flu.
 ...Yeah.
 ...It depends on how much vomit you want to have at the wedding.
 Caroline, I missed you!
 Yes, I can see it, Care.
 I'm human now, not blind. And I'm not fragile, either. You don't have to walk on eggshells around me.
 You know what? Given my luck, that actually seems possible.
 It's different, I'm slower, I have to look both ways before crossing the street, but it's nice to not...
 I was gonna say... not have to wear a daylight ring all the time.
 Care, I've wanted to be human from the day I became a vampire. Besides, I'm the last person that you need to apologize to.
 The dreaded "Amends Tour."
 Stefan's not a friend?
 Well, you're in the clear. He's got his hands full with Damon today.
 Not much... He just said he would take the cure with me...
 Yeah. Something tells me neither can he.
 Sounds like she's reached the full-blown crazy stage of drying out.
 It's hard for me to explain how awful it is but, yeah. Your mind starts playing tricks on you. You start seeing things, and people.
 Well, Stefan said that he has a plan. You know, to get her back on track.
 She has to. Bonnie, you already destroyed the Ascendant.
 We were just discussing the fact that there's a desiccating vampire locked in a cell less than fifty feet from where we're getting ready.
 I'm on my third glass, so speak slowly.
 Ha! It's Damon. He didn't.
 I want the perfect human life with him, too, Stefan! Trust me. But life isn't perfect. Okay, look  you have a few more hours, so push him. Make him see that.
 Heh, I do. Right before I told my ex-boyfriend how to get my current boyfriend to give up hope for our relationship. What if I made a huge mistake by taking the cure?
 Yeah, okay.
 Jo, are you okay?
 Hey, Jo. Jo. Jo. Jo!
 The doctor got the test results back. The babies are fine, you're fine. He thinks it was just...
 Yeah.
 Of course.
 You can't tell her that I told you.
 Not 'til the wedding.
 Ric, if there's anywhere that you should be superstitious, it's Mystic Falls.
 The doctors think that she had a panic attack.
 No, as in it's her wedding day and she has two small humans growing inside her, and she can't self-medicate like you, Bourbon-Breath. Sorry, I just... I saw her fall, and my first instinct was "Vamp to her," but I couldn't, and then I saw her hit her head, and I wanted to give her vampire blood, but I couldn't.
 No, because then I thought, "What would a human do?" So, I called 911, got her to the hospital, and then I let the doctors do their job, and it felt oddly empowering. Why didn't you tell me?
 How amazing it feels to be human again! At first, I was worried that it might take the edge of my senses, but it's the opposite. I feel...connected to the world again. I feel...
 Yeah.
 You're still up?
 Just... long. I keep having to tell myself, "A couple more years of residency, and I'll be free."
 I'm actually kind of tired, I'm gonna go to bed.
 You're drunk.
 I wanted you to own it, Damon, not pass out on it every night.
 Hey, I just finished my residency, Damon. I'm working my butt off to build a career.
 If you're that unhappy, then just sell the bar!
 I don't care, Damon. Whatever it is you want to do.
 You're right, Damon. You can't do any of those things anymore.
 Just say it.
 You're right. This was a mistake.
 She's fine. They discharged her.
 Okay, I'll tell her.
 Stefan!
 Okay.
 People are uncomfortable around Salvatore's in tuxes, it stirs... feelings.
 Is he with you?
 That sounds very ominous. You don't want him to take it, do you?
 Stefan, I'm not him. You can tell me how you really feel.
 Yeah, I know. So, what do you think he's gonna do?
 Hi.
 Uh, Jo went easy on me. I talked to Stefan.
 You can't take it just for me.
 What? No! What time is it?
 Oh my god. No, no, no, no, we're so late.
 Damon, put your tux back on.
 They're not here yet?
 What are you doing?
 On the ground where we first met?
 It's bad, isn't it?
 Damon, just tell me. How bad is it?
 You're going easy on me. Come on. This is supposed to be a special moment.
 Don't do that. Don't give up like that.
 Here. Say it.
 Fine.
 I'll say it. Here lies Elena Gilbert, a fun girlfriend and an amazing friend.
 I have to find humor in this, Matt. Because the alternative... The alternative would be to say good-bye, and I'm just... I'm not ready for that yet.
 Hang on, hang on. I just... I just need two seconds. Heh.
 This isn't goodbye Stefan. Besides, this hike is where I told you I didn't want to be a vampire. I thought it would be fitting considering 
 You knew that I never wanted to be a vampire, even before we took our first steps up that mountain. You just wanted to hear me say it out loud.
 I guess what I'm trying to say is that you knew me better than anyone. You always have, which is why you already know how impossible it is for me to  to find the words to say goodbye.
 Tell me, Damon. I can see it all over your face. How bad is it?
 What?!
 What are you gonna do? Damon? Damon?
 Take care of everyone while I'm gone, okay?
 Promise me something, both of you. Write it all down, everything that you accomplish in your life, every crush, when you fall in love, when you start a family, every time you fantasize about wanting to kill Damon..
 Write it down, so that one day when I wake up, I can read all about my best friends' lives and feel like I was there.
 This isn't your fault.
 Hey. We'll both get everything that we want. We just can't have it at the same time.
 Aw, hey. Bonnie Bennett. You have spent your entire life making sacrifices for me. Now it's my turn to do it for you. I just have one more favor to ask.
 Okay.
 Can you do it one last time?
 Very. Now it's your turn to be.
 That's my hope for you, Matt. In our crazy lives together, you've always stayed the same  human, loyal, and good. My hope is that you spend the rest of your life fighting for people like you.
 Matt. Look at everything that the two of us have survived.
 I like our odds.
 You're gonna think that the pain will never end, but it will. But first, you have to let it all in. You can't fight it. It's bigger than you. You have to let yourself drown in it. But then eventually you'll start to swim, and every single breath that you fight for will make you stronger
 And I promise that you will beat it.
 You made it!
 Oh, and I was doing so well. Ha ha. I'm sorry, I wanted to at least pretend to be strong for you.
 Not here, not in Mystic Falls.
 You need to get out of here, Tyler. You need to figure out what it is you want to do, who you want to be, and then just really fight for it. You're gonna be fine, Tyler. You're a wolf now, embrace it. Don't fight it. Let it be that thing that makes you extraordinary.
 Thank you for bumping into me that day in the hallway. I thought I would never be happy again, and then  and then I met you. You changed everything for me. You  you quite literally saved my life. I love you so much, which is why I can't wait to find out what new life you  you've chosen for yourself in sixty or seventy years when I see you again.
 Just be happy. I'll see you soon.
 I knew what you were going to do.
 I knew that the love of my life would stand by his best friend, even if it meant having to live without me for a little while
 No they're not, Damon, because you're not gonna sit around waiting for me.
 Damon, this isn't gonna work out if you just shut down. I need you to live your life, enjoy yourself. i want you to be happy. Now, how about that dance?
 Are you ready for this?
 I love you, Damon Salvatore.
 
 Right here.
 
 Um... no. I... I'm Elena.
  I'll call you later.
 Um, no, uh... I'm Elena.
 Got into a fight with my boyfriend.
 Life. Future. He's got it all mapped out.
 I don't know what I want.
 Tell me. What is it that I want?
 I know, Bonnie, you're right. You and my mom both are. I just can't bring myself to tell him. I'll call you later.
Um... no. I... I'm Elena.
 The most real thing that I've ever felt in my entire life. Promise me this is forever. I love you, Damon.
 I'm Elena.
 Dad?
 (more worried and alarmed] Dad!
 My necklace. I thought I'd never see it again. Thank you.
 My necklace. I thought I'd never see it again. Thank you.
 Bonnie?
 Hi!
 No. No, wait. This isn't how it's supposed to be. No. You can't die. Not yet. You have to live and, and grow old and have children, and grandchildren.
 No, this is wrong.
 Hi. What happened? Why am I here right now?
 I don't understand.
 You what?
 So Damon's okay?
 But you, you're...?
 No. Stefan.
 Dear Diary, today will be different. Today I will smile. It will be genuine. Because today is that day that I get to live again.
 Am I?
 How?
 Where is he?
 
 I need you to know that Stefan said something to me before we parted.
 And life goes on.
 After med school I came home to Mystic Falls. It felt right. It's where I wanted to grow old and, I did. And that's my life. Weird, messy, complicated, sad, wonderful, amazing and above all, epic. And I owe it all to Stefan. When I met him I had lost my parents and I was dead inside, but he brought me back to life and I'm going to live it as best I can, for as long as I can.
 Even after our long and happy life together, Damon is still worried he'll never see Stefan again. That he'll never find peace. But I know he's wrong, because peace exists. It lives in everything we hold dear.
 That is the promise of peace. That one day, after a long life, we find each other again.
