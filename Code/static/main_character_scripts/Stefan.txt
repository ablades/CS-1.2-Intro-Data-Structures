 
 I shouldn't have come home. I know the risk. But I had no choice. I have to know her.
 Please look again. I'm sure everything you need is there.
 Thank you.
 Uh, pardon me. Um...is this the men's room?
 You okay?
 No, I-a, uh, I-a just â€” I saw you fall.
 I'm visiting. I have family here.
 I'm Stefan.
 And English and French.
 Oh. Um, It's a family ring, yeah. I'm kinda stuck with it. It's weird, huh?
 Did you hurt yourself?
 Did you hurt yourself?
 You should go. Take care of that.
 I lost control today. Everything I've kept buried inside came rushing to the surface. I'm simply not able to resist her.
 Sorry, I was about to knock. I wanted to apologize for my disappearing act earlier. I know it was...strange.
 Um, something like that. How's your leg?
 It's a small town. I asked the first person I saw. Um, I thought you might want this back.
 Don't worry, I didn't...read it.
 Well, I wouldn't want anyone to read mine.
 Yeah, if I don't write it down, I forget it. Memories are too important.
 I'm fine. Sorry, were you going somewhere?
 Hi. Stefan.
 Mm-Hmm. And moved when I was still young.
 My parents passed away.
 None that I talk to. I live with my uncle.
 This was an animal attack.
 And I do.
 It's not my intention.
 I don't have to explain myself.
 Where do I belong?
 There were 346 casualties. Unless you're counting local civilians.
 Salvatore.
 Distant.
 Actually, there were 27, sir. Confederate soldiers, they fired on the church, believing it to be housing weapons. They were wrong. It was a night of great loss. The founder's archives are, uh, stored in civil hall if you'd like to brush up on your facts, Mr. Tanner.
 I did.
 Well, I'm 
 Hi.
 I did it again, didn't it?
 I'm sorry. You're upset about something.
 I'm here.
 Am I?
 Well, you have the mysterious thing going, too. Twinged in sadness.
 Well, we did meet in a graveyard.
 Well, I've never really been very good at, uh, chit-chat.
 You won't be sad forever, Elena.
 I like Bonnie, she seems like a good friend.
 And Matt, he can't seem to, uh, take his eyes off of us.
 And?
 Passionate?
 Oh, um...Yeah, no. It's, um, it's nothing. Um, are you thirsty? I'm gonna get us a drink.
 I think you've had too much to drink.
 Caroline. You and me, it's not gonna happen. Sorry.
 Is she like that with, uh, all the guys?
 What is it?
 The drunk one?
 Need some help?
 Someone else was attacked tonight, Zach, and it wasn't me.
 Damon.
 Crow's a bit much, don't you think?
 When'd you get here?
 It's been 15 years, Damon.
 Why are you here?
 You hate small towns. It's boring. There's nothing for you to do.
 You know, you left that girl alive tonight. That's very clumsy of you.
 Why are you here now?
 She's not Katherine.
 I know what you're doing, Damon. It's not gonna work.
 Stop it.
 Stop it!
 I said stop!
 You know, it's all fun and games, Damon, huh? But wherever you go, people die.
 Not here. I won't allow it.
 Damon, please. After all these years, can't we just give it a rest?
 Just stay away from Elena.
 I had a plan. I wanted to change who I was; create a life as someone new, someone without the past.
 Someone alive.
 They follow you.
 
 I know it's late. But, uh...I needed to know that you were ok.
 What do you tell them?
 Do you ever mean it?
 Yes.
 I'm awake. For the first time in a long time, I feel completely and undeniably wide awake.
 I welcome the day...
 I will see her again.
 I brought it. 
 All the Bronte sisters used pseudonyms. It was the time. Female writers weren't very accepted then.
 Uh, it was passed down. Through the family.
 I have lots of books. Go ahead. Keep it.
 Ok.
 It was an animal that attacked you. It came out of the night and jumped you. You blacked out. It's all you remember.
 An animal attacked you. You blacked out. It's all you remember.
 Elena. I didn't know you were coming over.
 Thank you for stopping by, Elena. Nice to see you.
 Someone had to clean up your mess.
 How long was Elena here?
 I'm not playing any game.
 What kind of game are you playing, Damon?
 'Cause I came home. He wants to make my life miserable. That's how he enjoys his.
 She won't. I took care of her.
 I'm not sure, Zach. I don't know how well it worked. I'm not as strong as Damon.
 I don't know. I'll deal with it.
 Thank you. Hi.
 You know, that comet...it's been traveling across space for thousands of years. All alone.
 I think it's just a ball of...snow and ice, trapped on a path that it can't escape. And once every 145 years, it gets to come home. I'm sorry about yesterday. I wasn't myself.
 Well, I have a lot to apologize for. Yesterday, that wasn't about you, ok?
 We're not close. It's, uh...it's complicated.
 What did he say?
 That was a long time ago.
 Elena...
 Hey.
 No, sorry.
 I'll keep an eye out for her.
 Did you?
 Visiting.
 Excuse me.
 Let her go.
 No, no, no!
 Don't.
 Don't.
 Please, Damon. Please don't do this.
 That's what this is about? You want to expose me?
 Why? So what, so I'll feed? So I'll kill? So I'll remember what it's like to be brothers again? You know what, let her go. Let her tell everyone that vampires have returned to Mystic Falls. Let them chain me up, and let them drive a stake through my heart, because at least I'll be free of you.
 You Okay?
 What are you up to, Damon?
 Yeah.
 Excuse me. Hi.
 Um, have you guys seen Elena?
 Thank you.
 You ok?
 Hi.
 Would you like to come in?
 No, no. I'm glad you're here. The way we left things...I didn't like it.
 What would you write?
 Do you want to know what I would write? "I met a girl. We talked. It was epic. But then the sun came up and reality set in. Well, this is reality. Right here."
 Good morning, Elena. Good morning, Bonnie.
 She doesn't like me very much.
 Yes.
 I used to. It was a long time ago.
 Yeah, I don't think so.
 No, I love football. I think it's a great sport. But in this case, I don't think football likes me. You saw Tyler over there, and we both know how Matt feels.
 Says the girl who spends her alone time writing in a cemetery.
 Well, I look forward to meeting her. And when will that be?
 Can't.
 I'm a loner.
 December 7, 1941.
 Anytime.
 1989. I'm good with dates, sir.
 1964.
 1963.
 '68.
 1865.
 1973.
 1954.
 1863.
 1950 to 1953.
 Uh, actually, sir, it was '53.
 Years and years of crossword puzzles. It's a loner thing.
 I wasn't here then, sir.
 Mr. Tanner, I realize that you and I didn't get off to the best start, and I want to apologize for that. I've played football before. Wide receiver, mostly, and I'm pretty good.
 '71 was the...Sorry. I...I understand that, sir.
 Yeah.
 It's all right.
 What are you doing here?
 You know, it doesn't have to be this way, Damon.
 Well, he let me on the team, so I must have done something right.
 Well, it's certainly interesting. I'm not too versed, but I do know that there's a history of Celtic druids that migrated here in the 1800s.
 Really? Salem witches?
 I would say that's pretty cool.
 Salem witches are heroic examples of individualism and nonconformity.
 What are you doing here?
 No, no, no. He can't, uh...he can't stay. Can you, Damon?
 We're just...finishing up.
 We don't need to get into that right now, Damon.
 That's a really nice scarf.
 Can I see it? I mean, would you mind taking it off?
 Why not? You ok?
 I was just commenting on her scarf.
 They are people, Damon. She's not a puppet. She doesn't exist for your amusement, for you to feed on whenever you want to.
 All right, you've had your fun. You used Caroline, you got to meet Elena, good for you. Now it's time for you to go.
 Hmm. That makes one of us.
 There must be a shred of humanity left inside my brother. Somewhere. I keep hoping. But how do I make him see it? And how do I protect her?
 What happened? No more cheerleader?
 No, hey, you're not a quitter. You suffered a great loss. You're not the same person. You should be looking ahead. You should be starting over. Ok? I hope you don't think this is too soon or too weird, but...I, uh, I wanted you to have this.
 It's something that I've had forever, and, uh, I've never wanted to give it to anyone until now. I'd very much like it if you'd wear it for me, for...good luck.
 No, it's, uh...it's an herb. It's nice, huh?
 And, uh, I wanted to thank you for pushing me to try out for the team. It feels really good.
 Right. We're a work in progress. We'll figure it out.
 Hey, he's down! Enough!
 No, no, no, it's fine.
 He missed. It's not my blood. See? I'm fine.
 It's ok. I'm ok. It's almost kick-off time, all right? So, um, I'll, uh, I'll see you after the game.
 Oh, yeah, I'm good.
 Ah, he's a messed-up kid. Somebody's gotta look out for him.
 Had your reasons.
 Not tonight. I'm done with you.
 Does it matter?
 No. You're not gonna hurt her, Damon.
 Because deep down inside, there is a part of you that feels for her. I was worried that you had no humanity left inside of you, that you may have actually become the monster that you pretend to be.
 Then kill me.
 No, you're not. You've had lifetimes to do it, and yet, here I am. I'm still alive. And there you are. You're still haunting me. After 145 years. Katherine is dead. And you hate me because you loved her, and you torture me because you still do. And that, my brother, is your humanity.
 No!
 I don't know. I don't know.
 I'm fine. I'm fine, ok? We're fine. That's what matters.
 I thought there was hope that somewhere deep inside, something in Damon was still human, normal. But I was wrong. There's nothing human left in Damon. No good, no kindness. No love. Only a monster Who must be stopped.
 Ahh!
 What are you talking about?
 Why would you cover your tracks?
 Can't touch her now.
 The real animal is still out there, waiting for me, challenging me to fight back, to stop him. But how do I stop a monster without becoming one myself?
 Hi.
 I'm good. Sorry.
 Yeah, you're probably right. That was getting a bit...
 Yeah.
 I can pull one off.
 They still do that?
 No, the Salvatores don't get invited anymore.
 I would be honored to accompany you, Miss Gilbert.
 What's going on?
 Hey, are you okay?
 I see it. All right, Zach, I see it.
 I can't, Zach. I can't. It would take human blood. It's the only way that I could stop him, and I can't do that.
 Vervain hasn't grown here since 1865. Damon saw to that. The little I had, I gave to Elena. What?
 You've been growing it.
 But you're telling me. Why?
 Why are you even going?
 I think it's better if we don't draw attention to ourselves.
 Can't seem to rid myself of you. What else am I supposed to do, besides go about living my life?
 Yes, being a 150-year-old teenager has been the height of my happiness.
 My happiness was short-lived, as you well know.
 I wasn't counting on it.
 Did what I wanted. It lowered his guard. He won't expect me to try again so soon.
 Thank you.
 Your parents?
 We don't need to bore them with stories of the past.
 I don't really dance.
 Damon told you to ask me to dance. Didn't he?
 Would you like one?
 Thank you.
 We were just chatting. Drink, Damon?
 Absolutely.
 I hope Damon didn't drive you too crazy.
 Hmm.
 It's not something I like to talk about.
 I know. Thank you.
 Damon said something, didn't he? He likes to play games and cause trouble, Elena.
 Let it go. I don't want to talk about it.
 Don't you see what Damon has done here? He's trying to get you to turn against me.
 What did he do?
 Um...I'm handling it.
 Elena, please. I...I don't expect you to understand.
 Look, there are things that you don't know, okay? Things that I want to tell you, but I can't. And I may never be able to. And I just need you to trust me.
 I'm so sorry. I have to go.
 You know, I couldn't spike your drink...So I spiked hers.
 I did what I had to do...To protect Elena, to protect everyone. Yes, Damon, the headline reads "Deadly beast captured. All is well in Mystic Falls."
 Won't be needing it anymore.
 Three days.
 During the dark ages when a vampire's actions threatened to expose or bring harm upon the entire race, they would face judgment. They sought to reeducate them rather than to punish them.
 You'll grow weaker and weaker. Eventually you won't be able to move or speak. In a week your skin will desiccate, and you'll mummify. A living corpse. Unable to hurt anyone. Ever.
 I've injected you with enough vervain to keep you weak. Once your circulation stops, I'll move you to the family crypt, and then in 50 years, we can reevaluate.
 You always have been. But you're not stronger than the vervain. And we both know it. I'm sorry. Didn't have to be this way.
 He's awake. He's weak, but it's probably best to stay out of the basement. He's Damon. I'm not sure how dangerous he still might be.
 Came here to live a life. It's about time I get back to that. And Elena, if she's still speaking to me.
 What am suppose to do, feed her another lie? I hate lying to her, Zach. I'm not good at it. She already thinks I'm hiding something.
 Hey.
 I'm so sorry I haven't called.
 I was dealing with Damon.
 Yes. Yeah.
 You have every right to be upset with me. But can I explain it all to you? Please.
 I gotta be home after school, but The Grill, around four o'clock?
 Thanks.
 He's gone, Caroline.
 He's not coming back. I'm sorry.
 Keep it up, Damon. The more energy you expend, the faster you'll go.
 Talk to who? I'm so sorry that I'm late.
 I got held up.
 There was this thing with my uncle.
 I'm really sorry. It was unavoidable.
 Oh, uh, Elena, please...
 I'm sorry?
 I think you have the wrong person, sir.
 I'm sorry. Excuse me. Hey, can we...can I take you home and we can talk about it? Is that ok?
 I I don't know. uh, nothing.
 Dinner. Jeremy told me that Chicken Parmesan is one of your favorites, and I happen to be a good cook. The Italian roots demand it. I can even make my own homemade mozzarella. Only tonight, it is unfortunately store bought. Sorry.
 You want to know me, right? Well, I figure if you're going to dump me, you should at least, um, know who you're dumping. So let's start with Katherine.
 She was...the most beautiful girl that I had ever met. She had this perfect olive skin. And she had this laugh. It was ridiculous. I mean, her laugh made you laugh. And she was fun. She knew how to have a good time. But Katherine was also very impatient and entitled and selfish, and, um, impulsive. Enter Damon. He claims that he was with her first. I don't know. I do know that I did some things that...I'm not proud of. And my biggest regret...is not being able to make it right before she died. I miss her, but...I'm no longer crippled by her loss.
 I'm an avid reader, a huge Fitzgerald fan, "The Great Gatsby", his masterpiece. But I'm no snob. I love some good Grisham. I think "Seinfeld" is the best American television show for the past 50 years, but "I Love Lucy" is all-time. "The loving cup" episode was the best, I think. Huge Scorsese fan. I can watch "Taxi Driver" over and over again.
 As far as music, it's pretty much across the board. Um, Dylan, Hendrix, Patsy, Willie. A little Kanye. You know what? I even like that one Miley song.
 Easy.
 Are you kidding? I love garlic.
 You ok? um...
 I I, uh, I think I got something in my eye.
 Part of your charm.
 Not particularly.
 The beauty of you in there and me out here...is that I can walk away.
 Hi.
 Did we just get scolded?
 Wow.
 I think you have to go first.
 I disagree.
 Oh, it's fine.
 Yeah, it's the family crest from the Italian renaissance.
 It's called lapis lazuli.
 No, it's...it's fine, really. Thanks, though.
 Ok.
 Caroline finally freed you, huh?
 No? Last name Salvatore didn't do it for you?
 My uncle Zach.
 Kinda just spread out.
 Why?
 Hmm.
 Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Hey.
 You were in some kind of a trance.
 I think so, yeah.
 Hey, have you seen Elena?
 You think she went home?
 Thanks.
 Zach! Oh, no, Zach...
 You must be Miss Pierce.
 You know.
 Yes, you do, or you wouldn't be here.
 Everything you know...And every belief that you have is about to change. Are you ready for that?
 I'm a vampire.
 No. Please.
 Please don't be afraid of me.
 No. Elena, there's things that you have to know and understand.
 Elena, please.
 Elena.
 No. That was Damon!
 Yes. I don't drink human blood. That's not how I choose to survive, but Damon does! I'll explain everything to you, but I beg you, Elena, do not tell anybody.
 Because you knowing this is dangerous for so many reasons. You can hate me, but I need you to trust me.
 I never wanted this.
 Hello?
 Where are you?
 I don't have it. Where are you? What have you done?
 You're being careless. How many more animal attacks is this town gonna believe, huh?
 I gave it to Zach to hide. Probably shouldn't have killed him.
 I'll get it back, but I need time.
 I already want you dead. Don't give me another reason to make it happen.
 Yeah? Is that gonna be before or after you get your ring back?
 I can tell you whatever you wanna know.
 Yes.
 We have rings that protect us.
 Decorative.
 Drinkable.
 Myth.
 Animal blood keeps me alive, but not as strong as Damon. He can be very powerful.
 Forcing Damon not to do something is much more dangerous, believe me.
 He was feeding on her. He was able to take away her memories of being bitten using a form of mind compulsion. She never knew what was happening to her. If he wanted to kill her, he would have.
 No. No, none of this is ok, Elena. I know that.
 Not in Mystic Falls; not anymore.
 There was a time when this town was...very much aware of vampires, and it didn't end well for anybody. That's why it's important that you don't tell anyone.
 Elena...Give me today. I will answer any questions that you have, and when it's over, you can decide for yourself what you wanna do with what you know. It'll be your choice.
 Stop here.
 I want to show you something.
 This...Didn't used to be nowhere. Used to be my home.
 Old? It's because they are.
 I've been 17 years old since 1864.
 You said you wanted to know. I'm not gonna hold anything back. Half a century before the boarding house was even built, this was my family's home. Damon and I...We were both born here. The Salvatore brothers, best friends.
 Wait. Where did you learn this game?
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are the rules? What are the rules?
 Uh, well, you could, uh...you could get hurt. My brother likes to play rough.
 Damon was trying to make you think that...I was still heartbroken. He saw that I was happy with you, and he wanted to ruin it.
 She wasn't just any girl.
 
 Your commitment to the confederacy is inspiring.
 With pleasure. I would be honored.
 She chose me. I escorted her to the ball at the original Lockwood mansion.
 I didn't care that I had gotten something that my brother wanted. I didn't even care if it hurt him. I only knew that I wanted her.
 That's the thing about Damon. He doesn't get mad. He just gets even.
 What Damon wants, Damon usually gets. I didn't know it at the time, but...Turns out that night...Katherine was with him, too.
 Turns out she wasn't ours to steal.
 I will love you forever.
 Not long enough.
 Your face, it was like a demon.
 Get away from me. Get away.
 I...
 Yes. We will go on.
 She could control my mind; and Damon's. She compelled each of us to keep the secret from the other. She wanted all of us to be together. Forever. Didn't work out that way, but...Damon and I, looks like we're stuck with each other...Like it or not.
 I took it from him, but I have to give it back.
 Elena, if I don't give it to him, he'll retaliate in the only way that he knows he can hurt me.
 By hurting you.
 No. That necklace, it contains an herb called vervain. It protects you from being compelled. I wanted to protect you from Damon's influence. But I also wanted to...Protect you from me. Elena, you should never take that necklace off...Because no matter what happens after today, no matter how you feel about me...You'll know that you were free to make your own choice.
 Elena, back up. Vicki, look at me. Focus. You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Guys, take her up to bed. Shut the blinds. She's gonna be ok. Come on. Come on.
 Yeah.
 She's transitioning.
 A vampire.
 Damon must have gotten to her. She's new. She hasn't completed her transformation yet.
 She has to feed on human blood.
 She'll die. She may only have a few hours.
 It's ok. She doesn't know what's happening to her yet.
 Right now, she doesn't remember anything. A part of her is still human, but slowly, the deeper she gets into the transition, the memories will start to come back, and then she'll know she has to make the choice.
 I can track her.
 Vicki.
 I'm so sorry. Damon had no right to do this to you.
 You'll fade quickly...And then it'll all just be over.
 Hey.
 I know. It'll be ok. You're gonna be ok. I can help you.
 Ok.
 Ahh!
 No! No! Vicki!
 No, it's ok. It's ok. I'm ok.
 I couldn't stop her. I tried.
 She fed, and then I lost her.
 I'll take care of it. I'll find her, and I will show her that she can live like I do. I will make sure that she does not hurt anybody, Elena. I promise you.
 We'll come up with a story.
 I'm so sorry.
 Damon, don't!
 Because you're changing, Vicki, and it's not something you wanna do alone.
 Well, if you're so worried that somebody's onto you, why don't you just leave town, Damon?
 Here.
 It's what you're craving.
 Go on. Give it a try.
 Because it's wrong to pray on innocent people, Vicki.
 No, no, no. There's no guarantee that you can control yourself, okay? It takes years to learn that. You could easily kill somebody, and then you have to carry that with you for the rest of your life, which, if I haven't made clear, is eternity.
 Hey, look at me. We choose our own path. Our values and our actions, they define who we are.
 Yes.
 She's upstairs.
 I'm working with her, but it's gonna take time. She's a very volatile and impulsive personality. She's a drug user. I mean, all that's gonna play a part in how she responds to this.
 I'm gonna keep her here with me until I know that she's safe.
 We can talk about that later.
 Coffee is our friend. It's the caffeine. It circulate through our veins, and it warms our body so we're not so cold to the touch.
 You're gonna have to learn to live with that urge and fight it on a daily basis one day at time.
 It can work. It's your choice, Vicki.
 Not in a long time.
 Years and years. I'm not proud of my past behavior.
 I'm going to, uh...I'm gonna get her some more. All right. I'll be quick.
 She's on edge. Imagine every sense in your body operating at super speed. I mean, she's uncomfortable in her own skin. And then when you throw in her other issues...
 There's no rule book.
 A while, But I didn't have anybody helping me. I had to do it on my own. The thing is it's hard to resist certain people especially when you're new, it's difficult to separate your feelings. Love, lust, anger, desire...it can all blur into one urge, hunger.
 It means that Jeremy can't see her, not now. She might not be able to resist him, and she could hurt him.
 I'm not gonna let anybody get hurt.
 Elena...
 What are you doing?
 No no. Hey hey...Now's not the time for this.
 She could hurt someone.
 Bad idea Damon.
 Is Vicki home?
 Can I see her, please?
 Just let me come in so I can explain myself.
 Matt...
 You didn't really give me a much of choice.
 You shouldn't be here Vicki. Crowds like this, it make it even harder for you to keep yourself under control.
 Really?
 No headache? Your stomach's not screaming at you? You're not feeling lightheaded or anxious or cranky like if someone looks at you the wrong way you could just rip their head off? Do you wanna know what that's called? It's called hunger and it's only gonna get worse and worse every minute that you pretend like it's not controlling you.
 What's the matter?
 Hey. uh, everything's fine.
 I'm trying to help her.
 Go. get inside. Go!
 I Need your help.
 Inside.
 I, uh...I wanted to help her. But instead, uh...How's he doin'?
 Elena, what can I do? I...What can I do to help? I'll do anything.
 Elena...
 If I did it, there's no guarantee that it would work...Because of who I am. Because of how I live. I don't have the ability to do it right.
 Is that what you want?
 Damon?
 Lexi!?
 What are you doing here?
 I missed you.
 I don't know who knows about us. That guy did. There could be others. Do me a favor, while you're here, please be careful.
 Do you think he would actually remember us? That was a pretty crazy weekend huh?
 I told you, her name is Elena.
 
 Inflicting misery somewhere. You gonna be okay here alone? 'Cause I got some things I gotta take care of.
 Doesn't work that way and you know it.
 Hey Lex. I'm really glad that you came here.
 
 I was trying to help her, I knew that Elena was worried about her brother, he was dating Vicki and she had a drug problems, so I tried to help.
 No.
 Yes.
 I was trying to help her Matt. That's all.
 You okay?
 Thank you.
 Why don't we go somewhere and talk about it.
 No
 Yeah, but see, this isn't about sex or...or compulsion or any of our other tricks. She has to want to be with me on her own terms.
 I'm not getting any older.
 No. Thank you.
 It doesn't matter. Cause if I started again...I just don't know if...
 Lexi, I'd never judge you.
 Yeah, I don't want a Birthday party.
 Damon, stay away from Caroline.
 I can't believe you actually think that we should go to this thing.
 A party that Damon wants us to go to, you know? So my question is why? I think he's up to something.
 He knows how to keep a low profile, believe me.
 It's my birthday, yeah?
 (claps hands together] Fine.
 What are you talking about?
 No, it's not what you think. She's not Katherine.
 I don't know.
 No. Maybe. I don't want to know. I have no desire to tie Elena to Katherine. 
 No. Elena is...Elena's warm and she's...she's kind, and she's caring, and she's selfless, and it's real. And honestly when I'm around her, I...I completely forget what I am.
 Yeah. Yeah, I am.
 Hey.
 Lexi said that you came by and you seemed upset.
 The towel?...Oh no no no no not like that, she's not exactly a girl Lexi's just 350 years old
 And she's my oldest friend. Nothing romantic. Ever.
 Yeah well I've talk about you a lot so...I guess she felt like she knew you.So why'd you come by?
 Elena talk to me.
 I want you to know that I will always be here for you. You can come to me about anything okay?
 Hey, do you need a ride to the grill tonight?
 Lexi's dragging me and...it's my birthday.
 Thank you.
 Well have a...have a good night.
 Matt, just hear me out please. I was just trying to help Vicki. I went through something similar once, I'm really sorry.
 Yeah, not really interested in making a fool out of myself.
 Do me a favor. Tell me if you see Damon with his camera phone.
 Woo!
 
 Hey, you came.
 Oh my god!
 Excuse me, sorry.
 
 He killed her! He killed Zach; he killed Tanner; he turned Vicki; I have to kill him!
 Why are you trying to save him?! Elena he's never gonna change! Don't you see that?! He's never gonna change!
 Everywhere I've been, pain and death follow; Damon follows me. No more.
 No. You were right to stay away from me. 
 You never do anything for anyone but yourself. 
 No. You saved my life. I'm sparing yours. We're even. And now we're done.
 What? What are you doing?
 
 
 
 
 Hi.
 Yeah, I got your messages, and I'm sorry I didn't get back to you, but what I wanna say shouldn't be said over the phone.
 I didn't kill my brother, as much as he deserved it. He has you to thank you for that.
 I won't be coming to school anymore. I'm gonna back off and keep my distance. It's the right thing to do.
 It's better this way.
 You're angry. That's good. It'll be easier if you hate me.
 I know that.
 What would Damon want with Bonnie?
 Over a necklace?
 
 The first night that you invited me over for dinner, I made the connection.
 What does it look like?
  with an amber crystal. I know it. It belonged to Katherine. Emily gave it to her, which means that...
 
 I'll get it out of him.
 So, Stefan...You know, I've been thinking. I think we should start over, give this brother thing another chance. We used to do it, oh-so well, once upon time.
 
 You could always just leave, find a new town to turn into your own personal Gas 'n' Sip.
 I'm not here to keep an eye on you.
 Why not?
 More like a carefully honed skill over many decades.
 Yeah. It's because I'm better than you.
 You prefer the brooding forehead?
 That's a funny question considering the fact that I have been asking you that for months. It's frustrating isn't it?
 Bonding. Catch! Go on. Give it a try.
 Downside of my diet getting hit actually hurts a little bit.
 It wasn't real, Damon. Our love for Katherine. She compelled us. We didn't have a choice. Took me years to sort that out, to truly understand what she did to us.
 What do you want with Katherine's crystal?
 Come on. You knew Elena would tell me.
 I was the last one to see her, Damon. Now, what do you want with Katherine's crystal?
 We had other things on our mind.
 
 How can you bring Katherine back?
 I remember the fear and the hysteria.
 How?
 But I saw her go inside...
 Are you telling me that Katherine's alive?
 The comet had to return.
 Why would Emily...? Why would she do this for you?
 I remember. You saved her children.
 What's wrong?
 What happened?
 What did she say?
 Where do you think she went?
 Just stay there. I'm gonna go find her.
 Hello, Emily.
 What do you mean evil?
 Them? What part of the story did you leave out, Damon?
 Emily, tell me what you did.
 You saved everyone in the church?
 I knew I shouldn't have believed a single word that comes out of your mouth. This isn't about love, is it? This is about revenge.
 Damon, you can't do this.
 27 vampires, Damon. They were vampires. You can't just bring them back.
 You're blaming innocent people for something that happened 145 years ago.
 She's alive, but barely. I can save her.
 I'm not gonna hurt you.
 No, she has to die with my blood in her system. So, keep an eye on her tonight and make sure that nothing happens, and once it leaves her system, she'll be fine.
 You sure?
 You shouldn't have to.
 
 I have to. Coming home was...it was a mistake. I can't be a part of your life anymore.
 Good-bye, Elena.
 So any idea of where you'll go?
 You donâ€™t have any friends, Damon.
 We are not going anywhere. Iâ€™m gonna live my life as far away from you as possible.
 Mmmm, that's funny. Seriously, where are you going? Because we are not staying in this town.
 Uh, sure. Ok.
 What is wrong with you? You killed somebody?
 Thatâ€™s impossible.
 Then, who could it be?
 No, I canâ€™t leave now and you know that. 
 Hi. 
 None. But it must be somebody new because leaving a body like that, they're either sloppy or they're trying to send a message.
 Well, Iâ€™m never sure about Damon, but heâ€™s been trying to keep a low profile lately, so itâ€™s just doesnâ€™t make any sense to me.
 Damon is tracking them right now. 
 Not yet.
 Hope thatâ€™s ok.
 You know I wanted to be a doctor before everything happened, but, uh, then I couldnâ€™t, 'cause...
 Yeah. Iâ€™ve dabbled in a bunch of different things, though.
 No, I...I loved it all. I just...I had to move on before anybody could notice that I wasnâ€™t getting any older.
 Few years, usually. Sometimes shorter.
 I didn't have a choice.
 
 Elena, itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t wanna be in it.
 
 Um, Elena, why don't you and Jenna go somewhere else?
 What are you doing here?
 Damon and I are the only two that I know of.
 You wanna know how you can walk around in the sun?
 You canâ€™t. Donâ€™t ever threaten me again.
 
 Well, there's no need. Heâ€™s here at the school.
 Heâ€™s working the crowd.
 Stay here.
 Sheâ€˜s ok. I took her home. She was shaken up. But all she knows is Logan attacked her. Nothing else.
 Damon's dealing with him.
 You saw what happened tonight, right? 
 Uh, I can get home.
 All right. That'd be nice.
 No, no. You had every right.
 This is different.
 I know that itâ€™s...that's it's hard to understand, but Iâ€™m doing this for you.
 Elena, I canâ€™t...
 Hm, well, it hasnâ€™t changed much over the years.
 Itâ€™s the only place that...that has remained constant. This room holds every memory that I've ever thought was important enough to hold on to.
 Yep. Are you thirsty or anything?
 Iâ€™m fine. Let me get you something to drink, ok?
 Elena?
 Elena. It's Stefan. I know that this picture must have confused you. But I can explain. I need to explain. So, please, when you get this, call me.
 Where is she? Why do you have her phone? Is she okay?
 Where are you? Let me speak to her.
 Damon, I swear to God, if you touch her...
 Argh!
 Bonnie.
 Hey.
 I haven't seen you lately. How are you doing with everything?
 Good. Yeah.
 No. Actually I came here to find you. I was hoping you could help me with something. A spell.
 I understand that. But I need your help. It's Elena. She's with Damon. I have Elena's necklace. I was just hoping you could use this to make some sort of a connection. I just need to know that she's okay.
 Because I've known a few witches over the years. I've seen what they can do.
 It's okay. Give it a shot.
 Okay.
 What is it?
 With Elena?
 Elena, is that you?
 Where are you?
 Not until I explain, please.
 Just tell me where you are, so that I can come get you.
 I honestly don't know.
 It's the truth. I  Listen...
 Hi.
 I'm Stefan. 
 Do you know where she went?
 I'm sorry?
 Can you?
 Bonnie!
 It's me! It's Stefan.
 It's okay. It's okay. Calm down. Come on, let's get you out of here.
 Just close your eyes. Trust me.
 You can open your eyes now.
 I didn't want to scare you.
 Well, your grandmother told me what you were doing. I guessed the where.
 In the beginning...yes. But not anymore. They've starved to the point of desiccation.
 That's not going to happen, Bonnie. They can't get out. Emily saw to that when she had you destroy the crystal. You're safe.
 You're welcome, Sheila.
 October 1969.
 And you were leading what was probably the only anti-war sit-in within miles of Mystic Falls.
 You know, when you spoke, people were mesmerized. I know I was.
 Your family has a very long history of keeping my secret. I knew that I could trust you if you believed I was worthy of your trust.
 Yes.
 I know that.
 Goodnight, Sheila.
 Hi.
 I wanted to tell you.
 You are not Katherine. You are the opposite of everything that she was.
 Before I met you.
 The first day of school. When we met. It wasn't for the first time, Elena.
 May 23, 2009.
 That was the day your parents' car went off the bridge.
 Every couple of years I come back here, to see Zach and see my home. Last spring, I was out in the woods, by old Wickery Bridge. And I heard the accident. All of it. I was fast getting there, but not fast enough. The car was already submerged. Your dad was still...he was still conscious. I was able to get to him, but he wouldn't let me help him, until I helped you.
 I went back for them. But it was too late. I couldn't  I couldn't save them. When I pulled you out, I looked at your face. You looked like Katherine. I couldn't believe the resemblance. After that, I spent months making sure that you weren't her. I watched you. I learned everything that I could about you. And I saw that you were nothing like Katherine. And I wanted to leave town, but, Elena, I couldn't. I couldn't leave without knowing you. I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you. I wanted to. But you were so sad.
 Elena, you've been through so much.
 It didn't make any sense to me. You were a Gilbert. She was a Pierce. But the resemblance was too similar. And then I learned the truth. 
 Your birth certificate from the city records. It says Elena Gilbert, Mystic Falls General. But there's no record of your mother ever being admitted. There's no record of her ever being pregnant.
 For me to go any further, I would've had to look into the Pierce family, and I couldn't do that. It's too much of a risk. If someone found out I was asking about Katherine...Listen to me, it doesn't matter. You are the woman that I love. I love you.
 I don't know. Do you remember anything else about him?
 I brought some vervain for, umâ€”for you and Jenna. 
 I know, but there's another vampire in town. So until we find out who it is and what he wants, we have to be careful.
 What are you lookin' for, Damon?
 No, but putting Elena in harm's way, that is my concern.
 I'm talking about Atlanta.
 I get it. You're just bitter because one of us gets to be with the person that we love, and poor Katherine is just out of reach. Unless there's another way for you to get into that tomb. Is that what Bree said?
 And you're transparent when you're deflecting.
 That's because we're predators, Elena. We hunt. We stalk. It's often as exciting as the kill. I want you to take this.
 I took it from Damon, who took it from Logan, who must have taken it from you.
 Well, it's not just a watch. It's a...it's a sort of compass, but it points to vampires.
 Gilberts were one of the founding families, and back in 1864, they were among those who sought to eradicate the vampires. The compass was used to find us.
 Yes. I want you to keep this. That way, you'll know if you're ever in danger.
 Cause you were looking for it.
 Gee, I don't know, Damon. Maybe you wanna do a little bit of posthumous bonding. Go ahead. Enjoy it. Read it. I have. Nowhere in it does it say anything about Katherine, or the tomb, or how to open it.
 I'm really sorry that it won't be of any help with your diabolical plan, the sequel. 
 I'll do anything to get you out of this town, even release Katherine.
 No, no, no. They can't come. They have to stay put, but Katherine, I would consider that.
 Think about it.
 See that's your problem, Damon. You apply all of your shortcomings to everybody else. If history's any indication, there's only one liar among us.
 Elena!
 Are you ok? Are you ok?
 He posed as a pizza delivery guy last night.
 And you have no idea who this is?
 Damon, he was invited in.
 That's a bad idea.
 What did you say to them?
 No. Doesn't work that way. See him anywhere?
 Heh. Wow. Not one of the better fashion trends.
 No. Burned. Buried.
 Well, that and, you know, McCarthyism and segregation and nuclear arms race.
 There were poodle skirts.
 No. That's not gonna happen.
 You mean we did all this dancing for nothing?
 I'm really sorry for all this.
 Uh, no.
 Now you remember that, because it's never gonna happen again.
 Uh, no.
 Get Damon.
 Where is he?
 Now you feel like talkin'?
 Wrong answer. Why are you doing this?
 What do you want with Elena?
 Who else is working with you?
 Elena, he's been invited in.
 Go. I got this.
 You are. 
 My offer still stands.
 No. Nothing hidden about it. No lies. No deception. I'm there when you open up that tomb, you and Katherine go, and the other 26 vampires die.
 I'll help you.
 Because I'm your brother.
 Because I want you gone.
 Doing ok?
 Is it true?
 It's the adrenaline. You'll crash soon enough.
 I wish you didn't have to fight at all.
 I need to tell you something, and I don't know how you're gonna feel about it.
 I told Damon that I'd help him get into that tomb to get Katherine back. But it was a lie. I let him believe that he could trust me.
 Because he can be very persuasive, and you two have bonded lately.
 I don't wanna be his enemy, Elena, but I can't let him do it.
 Ok. Come here.
 I could get used to this.
 What are you doing?
 Seriously, get out of here!
 You don't have to do anything that you don't want to do.
 How do we know that this journal will hold the location of the grimoire? We're really going to take the word of this vampire? He seemed like a bit of a dimwit
 Every spell that a witch casts is unique unto itself, so every witch would document their work.
 What about our mystery vampire? Dimwit obviously wasn't working alone, so whoever's out there knows who we are.
 OK.
 We shouldn't-
 I don't think Damon knows what to believe. Trust isn't something that comes naturally to him.
 There are other ways to get what you want. You don't have to kill people. Damon has no regard for human life. He enjoys inflicting pain on others. For 145 years, every single time that I have let my guard down and let Damon back into my life, he's done something to make me regret that. I'm not going to make that mistake again.
 I think that no matter what Damon promises, a lot of people will die.
 That's Johnathan Gilbert.
 Excuse me, father. I didn't know you had guests.
 I'll come back. Forgive me, Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Lockwood.
 You shouldn't have done that.
 Have a seat.
 What is this, compressed air? 
 Now...who are you?
 Are we gonna have to do this the hard way?
 So you show up like Van Helsing. Come on. Tell me the truth.
 Where's your wife?
 Where's the Gilbert journal?
 Where is it?
 No, it's not.
 Of course they can. Is there any doubt?
 Damon left the Confederacy on principle. It was his choice and should be respected.
 You said the town is in trouble?
 Killers? What are you talking about?
 How long have you been aware of me?
 You met Damon.
 Are you certain it was Damon?
 If you're here for revenge, this is going to end very badly for you.
 I thought you just said that Damon...
 Damon can never know why you're here. He'll kill you without blinking.
 
 Perhaps she does.
 Not if we talk to him; explained how we feel. He could help us keep her safe.
 That's not true. We can trust him.
 I promise.
 I don't know.
 No, he doesn't know anything. Somebody got to it right before me.
 Wait, who is Anna?
 He left to track down Jeremy's friend Anna, see if there was anything there.
 Doesn't matter.
 It's a copy of it.
 Well, Mr. Saltzman made a copy and was kind enough to loan it to me.
 Not exactly, but I got it.
 Yeah.
 "It was Giuseppe Salvatore who removed my fear. He told me he would protect the secret of the spell book. He said he would carry it to his grave."
 Did I interrupt your writing?
 A great mind.
 To your grave.
 I have concerns about your plan for the vampires.
 We are making the assumption that all vampires are as evil as they've been characterized, but what if that's not true?
 No. No, of course not. But are we to take what others say at face value? You always taught us so differently.
 I know where it is.
 It wasn't built until well after he died.
 As sure as I could be.
 Elena. I can do this on my own.
 I know, and I appreciate that, but-
 What is that?
 From Damon?
 I want you all to myself.
 And why is that?
 Yes, you are.
 What? What?
 What?
 Katherine! Katherine!
 What? No!
 How did you know?
 What?
 I can't let you bring her back. I'm sorry.
 Oh. You're not capable of trust. The fact that you're here means that you read the journal and you were planning on doing this yourself.
 You won't kill her.
 Let her go first.
 I'm not going to give this to you until she is standing next to me.
 You just did the one thing that ensures that I will.
 Okay.
 Oh, you'll be fine. That was just a small amount of blood. It should pass out of your system by tomorrow.
 Damon was right. This is, uh...this is my fault.
 Damon! Damon! Stop, stop. I'll help you. We'll get her back.
 I didn't think this would happen.
 I put my faith in my father, but Damon put his faith in me, and I destroyed that. This is my fault.
 Okay.
 I'm going to get you that aspirin.
 We're just going to hang out for a little while.
 You got it. Hey, do you have any aspirin?
 Where'd who go?
 Elena!
 Anna took Elena.
 Damon, all night long, every single street in town, I've been searching. What if your blood hasn't passed out of her system?
 Please. 
 You know, all I can remember is hating you. There might have been a time when that was different, but your choices have erased anything good about you. 
 So please, just tell me what you know.
 
 Elena? Are you okay?
 I can get it.
 Let's get outside!
 When the sun goes down, leave town. If I ever see you again, I will kill you.
 Well, for now, you need to stay here.
 I can't protect you if you leave the house.
 We still have to get Damon to agree.
 Yeah, and then we double crossed him. So now he's angry.
 Cleared the debris away. Set the torches like you asked. We can get down now.
 It's everything I need to destroy them.
 Everything okay?
 What's that?
 
 Sounds Latin.
 
 Thought I told you to leave.
 I can't let you do that.
 Do you really think that she cares about you? Hm? You're disposable.
 Are you going to say "eternal life"? You really that stupid?
 No. I got this.
 Where's Elena?
 What?!
 What did you do?
 What's the seal?
 Elena's human. She can leave. Anna and Katherine can't. Damon can't. You were never planning on breaking the spell, were you?
 Let her go!
 Go. Go. I'm right behind you.
 I can't.
 I heard you scream.
 I know.
 Damon.
 What?
 Damon, we need to get out of here.
 If we don't leave now, we're not getting out.
 It's not worth spending all of eternity down here. She's not worth it!
 He's okay.
 He's all right.
 Everything alright?
 I don't know. Can I call you later?
 Alaric's wife might have been your mother?
 You wanna talk to her.
 Elena, did Jenna tell you anything about Alaric's wife? How she died?
 The night at the school when he attacked me, he told me some things about her death.
 No, no. 
 I should get going. I gotta go deal with Damon.
 He's dealing in his own way.
 Can we talk?
 Without the Tri-Delts.
 That's kind of what I'm afraid of.
 Those girls?
 There was a woman you may have known a few years back named Isobel in North Carolina at Duke.
 You killed her.
 I justâ€”just wanna know if you remember anything about her.
 Well, think hard. It's important.
 Jenna told you.
 So it's true. Your wife Isobel was Elena's birth mother.
 
 She knows what I am, and she knows that you know about the vampires.
 No. I couldn't tell her, not until I was sure.
 I asked Damon without saying too much. He doesn't remember.
 Damon is not stable right now.
 I'm telling you not to push this.
 Your survival. How's that for a reason? I'll handle it, but for now, I need you to let it go.
 
 I need something more than just your wife's name. A picture, something I could show Damon.
 He's Damon.
 Won't hold my breath.
 How was it?
 It isn't. This is Alaric's wife.
 Everything he knows about vampires, he learned from her. He believes that she was killed by one.
 Listen, Elena, there's a lot about Isobel that Alaric can tell you, but I need you to hold off a little while before you talk to him.
 I know that it's a lot to ask of you, but will you do that for me?
 She's on her way to the Grill. I, uh, wanted to talk to you.
 This is the woman, Isobel, from North Carolina. Remember her now?
 I do.
 Did you kill her?
 Elena.
 I don't know what happened. Alaric said that they never found the body.
 I know. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. But I justâ€”I wanted to know more.
 He doesn't know about the connection to you. I thought about confronting him, but he's already so on edge.
 Because you're not the only one hoping that he might actually change.
 Get back inside. Come on.
 Elena.
 Come on. Let's get you home.
 Who are you?
 Elena, he's under compulsion.
 Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on.
 What happened? What did you do?
 Damon.
 Like you've been handling Katherine?
 Stop it. You don't have to keep looking.
 You were just...Did Damon turn you?
 No, no, no. You must have vampire blood in your system. Somebody slipped it to you.
 Then how?
 That's impossible.
 Damon hasn't said a word to me. Every time I try to talk to him he shuts me down.
 I don't know. He waited a hundred and forty five years only to find out that Katherine could not care less. I mean it's gotta hurt, right?
 You have every reason to be upset with him. Have you thought any more about what you're going to do?
 I'm sorry I brought it up.
 No vampires at all?
 Ooh, that sounds good to me, when do we start?
 You mean like a double date?
 I think that sounds like a great idea.
 Yeah. A nice evening out with friends. Sounds fun, as in "fun".
 I figured it's a date, why not do it right? I would have driven too but you're the one with the car.
 Oh, I have one. I just never drive it.
 Why we would do that?
 That's exactly why we're going to do it. We're going to go out, have some fun and try to remember that we don't have to be so serious. Listen, when I decided to stay here and to get to know you, it so that I could do things like this. Bring my girlfriend flowers, take her out on a date, and try to be normal.
 Oh, absolutely. '72, Hef and the twins.
 Yeah...playmates. I got Miss June.
 You're kidding?
 Double dating. This is all kind of new to me. I usually keep to myself. I don't always fit in.
 What guy?
 Is that what I seem like?
 Hmm...What a dick!
 Matt's cheating.
 So, you didn't recognize him, you haven't seen him before?
 Right, let's call it a night. OK? Send Matt and Caroline home?
 You're sure?
 OK.
 It's them. Come here.
 Yeah, I guess it's a bit much.
 This is uh...a little hobby of mine.
 You like cars?
 Come with me.
 Prepare yourself, my friend.
 Got passed down through the family.
 Well, it doesn't run. I mean, it's not that I could figure out.
 wow.
 No, no, no. Don't worry about it. You and Elena, you guys have a history and ignoring it doesn't do anybody any good.
 You know what? Why don't you guys go ahead and take it for a spin?
 Yeah.
 You alright?
 Just wish you let me drive you home.
 I know, I just get so worry about you.
 Okay. Call me when you get home safe.
 Goodbye.
 Are you crazy?
 I remember them from 1864. They were in the tomb.
 Good, good. I'm glad.
 No, no, no, no. Not tonight, you still have a few minutes left of normal. I'll tell you about it tomorrow okay?
 Such a liar.
 I had a really nice time too.
 Yeah. And then what? We turn to the rest of that house of vampires and say, "Oops. Sorry?"
 This isn't being very productive. We're gonna figure out a way to deal with Pearl and the vampires. Yeah? Hmm.
 I know. He makes everybody cranky.
 Damon and I are gonna handle everything, I promise.
 That's exactly what you're gonna do, because that's what going to keep you safe.
 What do you mean? I'm perfectly safe. I have Damon, the self-serving psychopath on my side.
 That guy did a number on me last night when he stabbed me. I gotta get my strength back up.
 We'll talk when I get back?
 Aah!
 Ugh!
 Uhh! Aah!
 Aah! Unh!
 Aah!
 Aah! Aah!
 Uhh. Thank you. For trying to help me.
 Elena...You shouldn't be here...
 Unh! No. No. No. Not him.
 There's vervain on the ropes.
 Unh!
 Wait.
 Uhh!
 The other one.
 Uhh.
 Uhh! Unh.
 Ohh. You okay?
 Ugh! Uhh...
 Aah!
 Unh. Uhh.
 Elena, please run.
 Please.
 Go, Elena. Run. Run...
 Argh! Ahh! Aah! Aah!
 I'm okay. The wounds have mostly healed.
 Elena...
 What you did today, coming to help me...You could have been killed.
 And what I did, I'm sorry that...I'm sorry that you had to see it.
 What? No. no. no. no. You didn't make me do anything. You were saving my life. And I was saving yours. Everything's gonna be okay.
 Sorry.
 Soon.
 Can you get that away from me please?
 I'll be fine; it just takes a little bit of time.
 Oh, I'm impressed.
 What are we planning on doing about that?
 I have my reasons.
 You're really enjoying this, aren't you? Watching me struggle?
 I hate to break it to you Damon but...I actually have it under complete control.
 Damon took away those memories for good, you don't have to worry about that. I tell you what  why don't you just ask him?
 Why not? I mean if he doesn't know anything then it's just an innocent question.
 Maybe it's time you start opening up to him. I'm not saying you should tell him everything but at least try to find out what he does know and be prepared for it.
 Much, much better. I'm still, you know...a little jittery, a little bit on edge but I'm gonna be okay.
 I just needed to lay low for a little while and let my body readjust. It's only been a few days.
 I've missed you too.
 Oh god! I shouldn't be here.
 I really liked you a whole lot better when you hated everybody.
 I'm good, I'm fine.
 Ah! Nothing will make you happier to just see me given up hein Damon?
 Well, I'm gonna find Elena.
 Hey. How are you?
 Okay, I know it's a little weird but it's really helping me. The alcohol takes the edge off.
 I totally am, yeah.
 Oh no! You don't need to be worried. It's just until the cravings go away. Listen, I think we should enjoy it while it lasts. Would you like to dance with me?
 No, no, no you have to beg the sober me. The drunk me there is no begging necessary.
 That's because they need something better to dance to. I'll be right back.
 Please dance with your alcoholic vampire boyfriend.
 That no way to talk to a lady.
 I think you need to apologize.
 Now say it like you mean it.
 Now walk away.
 You alright?
 Actually, I don't want any news Damon.
 What?
 Damon.
 Is everything alright?
 Uh, I'm sorry.
 You don't want to do this man.
 Get out of my way. Please.
 Sorry. I'm sorry that I ran off earlier.
 Uh, no.
 I tried so hard to keep it together tonight and it was working, it was working but then Matt's mom, she got hurt and she was bleeding and I had her blood on my hands.
 And then that guy in the parking lot, I wanted to feed on him and it took everything inside of me not to do it.
 No, but I wanted to. Elena, my head is pounding. I feel like my skin is on fire. I have this hunger inside of me that I've never felt before in my entire life and all I keep thinking about is how I promised that I would never keep anything from you, and so I'm telling you this.
 But I don't want you to see me like this, I don't want you to know that this side of me exists.
 No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, I can't, I'm afraid of what I could do to you.
 I love you so much.
 Thought it was a waste to leave it in the garage.
 You know, I woke up this morning and I was feeling great and I figured it was time for me to get back into things.
 Yeah, I mean the worst part is over so...now all I want to do is just spend as much time with you as possible.
 Hey, thank you for helping me get through the rough patch.
 Okay, uh, you know what? I'll catch up with you, I'm gonna grab my stuff. I'll be right behind you.
 Fine.
 You're making small talk, why?
 And you think it's because I drank human blood again.
 Well, I hate to burst your bubble but I'm clean.
 Not only isn't possible but it is quite true.
 I'm clean.
 Believe what you want.
 I will be happy to escort you anyway.
 It'll be great, we'll have fun.
 I love you too.
 Go ahead, help yourself.
 So, I'm drinking blood again. You're the one that shoved it on me, what's your problem? I have it under control.
 So, what's your point?
 Have my actions negatively impacted you? I can't imagine what that must feel like.
 Nothing's changed; I'm still the same person.
 Elena doesn't need to know anything yet.
 I'm not having trouble.
 I know that it pains you to see this but I'm fine, okay? I'm fine.
 So please, do me a favor and back off.
 You're only saying that because you don't know how to do it.
 Ouch!
 If you ask me, the 'near touch' is overrated.
 Is that a bad thing? Would you prefer me to be brooding and tortured?
 Oh, no touching!
 Hey, how are you?
 Yes, I'm sorry. I was just...I was feeling a little sick.
 What's going on in here?
 I was going to tell you.
 I'm fine. I'm fine, the blood, it doesn't change anything.
 Why? Because I kept it a secret from you? Come on Elena, look, giving the way you're reacting right now, can you really blame me for doing that?
 So what - so you and Damon all of a sudden have everything figured out then?
 I know and I'm telling you that I'm fine. I'm fine. Please, come on. Elena I thought you...I thought you believed in me.
 I don't know.
 Not now you're not.
 You're standing in the parking lot with me.
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not very good to be around right now, I'm a little bit on the edge. I've been drinking the human stuff and it's really screwing with my head. She knows now. God! She wasn't supposed to found out, I didn't want her to found out, now everything's ruined.
 I'm not sad. I'm freaking hungry!
 I don't hurt people. I don't do that. I'm the good brother.
 I want to kill you, I want to rip into your skin and I want to feed on your blood.
 Under your skin, pulsating, floating.
 Your carotid artery right here. If you puncture this just right you can control the blood flow. It takes practice but it doesn't have to make a mess, you don't have to waste any.
 I just want one taste; that's all I need, I just want one taste.
 I can't do this.
 I can't do this.
 Oh god oh god oh god! I can't stop.
 Why aren't you afraid of me?
 What? What's your name?
 Listen to me, Amber. I need you to be afraid of me. I need you to run like hell do you understand me? Run, run now!
 I changed my mind.
 You shouldn't be here.
 Now you know.
 Oh, it was absolutely me. A monster, a predator, that's who I am Elena.
 The blood brings out what's inside of me and if you think any differently then you're an idiot.
 I wanted to drain every ounce of blood from that girl's body.
 It's who I am Elena.
 Why would you risk it? Why would you come here?
 All you did was expose me to who I really am.
 Don't get any closer to me.
 Stop.
 Stop!!!
 Stop!
 I'm so sorry.
 I don't know what's happening to me.
 We don't have long.
 We're going to get you out of here. Damon, hurry. Hurry.
 No! No. Damon.
 Uhh!
 Where am I?
 Where's Damon? Am I...am I a...?
 But how? I...
 No. I never...
 And Damon?
 I'm not hungry.
 I bet Johnathan Gilbert has told father by now. Wonder how he took the news that we're dead.
 He thought he was protecting us, Damon. He thought he was protecting this town.
 It's part of it. The muscle aches, the sick feeling...Emily says it's our bodies pushing us to feed, to complete the transition.
 Is that your choice, then? To die instead?
 I don't want to survive.
 I'm sorry, Elena. No more. After what I've done, it has to end. I just want it over.
 You know, Damon hasn't fed me vervain in a while. I could be at those bars in a flash, and you'd be dead.
 Please just go away. I don't want you here.
 What are you doing? Get out of here.
 You're taking a stupid risk. I could hurt you.
 Elena, get out of here, or you'll regret it.
 I said get out!
 I'm making the decision I should have made years ago.
 You have to feed in order to complete the transition.
 It was a choice I shouldn't have made.
 Even in our death, you only feel shame?
 No. Father, I came to say good-bye.
 You were there when we were shot?
 You killed your own sons?
 I haven't turned yet. I don't want to. I'm going to let myself die, father. Please.
 Father, I didn't mean to.
 No, let me help you. Please.
 Uhh. Uhh! Oh, God. What's happening to me?
 How can you even look at me right now?
 You're so sure I'm ready?
 I brought her for you. She's a gift. Have a seat, please.
 Damon, I've been to see father. He came at me. I didn't know my own strength. There was blood everywhere. He was dying, and the blood was too strong. I needed it. I had to have it.
 Yes. And it's incredible. My body is exploding with power, Damon.
 I can hear things from far away. I can see through the darkness. I can move, like it's magic. And the guilt, the pain...Damon, I can turn it off. Like a switch. Katherine was right. It's a whole another world out there, Damon.
 No. You can turn that off, too. You don't have to feel that pain anymore.
 You're weak. You'll be dead soon. You need this.
 You'll die.
 Please. I won't let you die.
 Don't fight it. We can do this...together.
 How do you feel?
 We can explore it together.
 Damon!
 You'd have rather found me dead?
 It feels more like a gift.
 Why is that?
 Emily, wait.
 I should have died that night, just like I had chosen. I should have let Damon die, too.
 Every single person that's been hurt...Every single life that's been lost, it's because of me.
 I made a choice, Elena. Because of that choice, a lot of people were hurt.
 No. Please don't do that.
 Please. Don't make this all okay.
 You don't understand, Elena.
 It hurts me. It hurts me, knowing what I've done, and that pain...That pain is with me all the time. And every day, I think that if I just...If I just give myself over to the blood, I can make that pain stop. It would be that easy, and every day, I fight that. And I am so terrified that one day, I'm not gonna want to fight that anymore, Elena. And the next time I hurt somebody...It could be you.
 You don't know that.
 Elena.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 I mean it. Thank you. For...helping her take care of me.
 Do you feel guilt?
 She didn't want either one of us to turn. She said it was a curse.
 Why didn't you tell me?
 I know.
 Then why?
 Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting. We don't know why or what she wants.
 Caroline, call an ambulance.
 Damon has it. He's going to be difficult to reason with.
 He's not just gonna hand it over, especially if it's harmful to vampires.
 Really? How are you going to do that? Because Isobel is a vampire and Jeremy could be dead the second you walk in the door.
 It's about what Isobel said.
 Well, I know that you and Elena have bounded and I know that she cares about you and...I know you care about her.
 I'm just concerned about Elena being hurt. She considers you a friend.
 So, at the risk of sounding like uh...like a jealous boyfriend.
 History will not be repeating itself where Elena is concerned. Do you understand what I'm saying?
 Do you understand?
 What truth?
 What are you talking about?
 So you think that John is Elena's father?
 What proof do you have?
 What are you doing here?
 Don't start with me, Damon.
 As long as you heard it.
 Actually I've no sense of 'Damon humor'.
 You're right, she's not.
 There is no proof, but he dated Isobel when she was a teenager and he was the one who brought her to your dad's office for the delivery.
 Sorry, I'm sorry. I just...I wanted to tell you before Damon dropped it on you on some typically inappropriate way.
 I guess, when you're ready.
 He's just hurt, he's confused.
 He's your brother, he'll forgive you. Just give him some time.
 Let him go.
 Are you alright?
 What are you doing?
 Elena's relationship with her brother is none of your business. So stay out of it!
 Get over yourself. We both know you're not doing this for the right reasons.
 Well, see Damon, it's only real when it comes from your desire to do the right thing for nothing in return, and I know that it is an entirely foreign concept to you. I completely understand that you wouldn't get it.
 Wait, where are you going?
 Let's go find him, come on!
 My head!
 My head!!
 It was like needles were piercing my skull and it just stopped.
 It's the Gilbert's device. It has to be.
 No, no, no, he's right. Think about it. We asked Bonnie to deactivate a device that could protect people against vampires.
 And Damon. Vampires. Where is Damon?
 Wait, wait, wait, I can hear them. The building is on fire.
 The building's on fire!
 You know the building well, is there another way in?
 He's my brother, Bonnie!
 Damon! Come on, hurry!
 Did you see where Damon went?
 Figures.
 I try so hard...to hate him. I guess it's just pointless.
 I just...you know, I know my brother.
 I know the trouble he can cause.
 Oh, hey.
 You...you just missed Elena.
 Oh.
 I'm very grateful Bonnie, I hope you know that.
 We both want the same thing.
 Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
 You bet.
 I love you too.
 What happened?
 Come here. Look at me. Shh.
 No, he's fine.
 Jeremy, Jeremy. Come here, sit down.
 I am very sorry about Anna, but it's very important that you listen to me right now. With every passing moment, Anna's blood is leaving your system. If you try to kill yourself right now, you could really die.
 Hey! Do you understand me?!
 Good.
 He didn't take enough to die so Anna's blood actually healed him of that.
 You need to be at the hospital.
 No, no, no, I'll stay here with Jeremy.
 Hey! How was Caroline?
 Katherine.
 Elena.
 No.
 She said she fooled one of us, at least. What does that mean?
 Are you alright?
 I know. We all did.
 Right and we need to find out what those other plans are and not provoke her in the process. What happened tonight when you thought she was Elena?
 What do you mean you kissed?
 Later.
 No, actually Elena's right, John could know something through Isobel. Your mother, she was in touch with Katherine so maybe we can go to the hospital and get him to talk.
 Yeah? And then what?
 Ready for this?
 We know she did this to you.
 You tell us.
 You're a little too weak to play tough guy. Why don't you just sit back and answer a few questions?
 She'll try again; we can't help you if you don't confide in us.
 In your daughter then.
 You may be okay with dying but I have a better plan for you.
 You now have my blood in your system; all I have to do is kill you. Now take my advice. Leave town. Elena doesn't want you here. You've got about 24 hours before the blood leaves your system, that's enough time to disappear or so help me God, I will turn you into a vampire and I will watch you hate yourself more than you already do. The clock starts now. (He leaves the room.)
 I...I asked him to leave town.
 Yeah, I threatened him.
 I know.
 Now (They pull apart.), I need to go find Damon.
 No Elena, he tried to kiss you. I'm not okay with that.
 Katherine.
 Leave her alone.
 What are you doing here?
 You're taking this a little far, don't you think? Elena could walk in at any moment.
 You need to leave now.
 Katherine, I'm not doing this with you.
 Just tell me what you're doing here.
 What game are you playing?
 I don't know. How can I play if I don't know the rules?
 Yeah, why did you want them dead? You're the one who turned most of them.
 You haven't changed at all, have you?
 Don't flirt with me Katherine. I'm not Damon; I haven't spent one hundred and forty five years obsessed with you.
 I was never in love with you, Katherine. You compelled me. So none of my feelings were real.
 The truth? Well the truth is, you're the same lying, selfish, manipulative bitch that you've always been. So, whatever it is that brought you here, why don't you just get on with it and leave town? Because if you don't, I will hunt you down and I will rip your heart out.
 Well the problem, Katherine, is that I hate you.
 Yeah, it will heal.
 I was trying to figure her out. I was playing along and I let her get to me.
 That's not what's happening.
 I'm not gonna fight you.
 Katherine is gonna try to play us against each other, you do know that right?
 We need to stay united against her. So yes, as much as I would like to kill you, I'm not gonna fight you.
 Because you feel something for her, because you actually care and I'm not gonna let Katherine come in here and destroy that part of you that is finally, after all of this time, willing to feel something. She will try to break you, she will try to break us and how we respond to that will define us. It's our choice. So no, I'm not gonna fight you.
 He saw the ring, that's why he did it. He knew.
 It's Katherine. She got under his skin. She undid everything that was good about him.
 I know. I know.
 He's okay. Shhh, you're okay.
 It's the same as the bracelet Elena gave you.
 Vervain is toxic to vampires.
 Yeah, it's very poisonous. It keeps them out of your head.
 Don't know, certain natural herbs and roots and other elements are just harmful to vampires.
 Right but it has to be wood.
 Jeremy, if I thought you wanted to kill me we would be having a much different conversation.
 I want you to forget about Damon, all right? He's hundred times stronger than you and right now he's not stable. You got to try to move forward.
 Right. Well, today we have a nice little distraction courtesy of the slave driver Elena.
 Hello Elena.
 He's gonna be alright, he's just been through a little bit of an ordeal.
 That was what we were doing here?
 Got it!
 Yeah I know, I'm seeing it and I'm liking it but I have a quick question. Uh, what do we do about Damon?
 Unfortunately Katherine showing up has been a little bit of an odd place, little off-kilter, kind of dangerous. Who knows what he's up to?
 No, thank you. I'm not hungry, just ate.
 I'm just happy that's a blood bag and not a sorority girl supplying your dinner.
 Have you heard from Katherine?
 Is this your new obsession?
 We haven't seen the last of Katherine, you do know that right? We have no idea what she's up to.
 You're lurking.
 More like obsessing.
 He's a triple letter varsity athlete, of course he has strength. You're reaching.
 That's ridiculous.
 Yeah, sure, I'll...give it a shot.
 My brother over there thinks I can beat you.
 Yeah, actually I did.
 No, no, it wasn't that kind of strength but it was more than human, if that makes any sense.
 Ooh, ah, maybe they're, um, ninja turtles!
 Or no, zombies, werewolves.
 What? What are you up to?
 I said ninja turtles, actually.
 Damon, don't do this.
 Do you realize someone is going to get hurt right?
 What's that going to accomplish?
 You all right man?
 You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
 How did this happen?
 And she said "game on"? I mean, what does that even mean?
 Caroline must be completely out of her mind, she doesn't even know what's happening to her.
 We have to find her.
 Damon, absolutely not.
 We're not gonna kill her.
 Damon's right, not about what we should do but about what's gonna happen. Katherine already signed Caroline's death sentence.
 Actually, she's doing it to me.
 Blood. I can smell blood.
 It's alright, Caroline, come with me.
 Yeah, maybe so, but it's not gonna happen tonight.
 It's okay, come on.
 No, no, she's just in shock, we all are.
 Ssh. One thing at one time, let's get this blood off, come on.
 Look at me, your emotions are heightened right now. It's part of the transformation. it's completely normal. I promise you. Okay?
 Look at me, look at me, look at me! Caroline, Caroline! Look at me! Look at my face, look at my face! It's the only way you're gonna survive this thing. Try.
 That's good.
 I don't know, I wish I did. Hey, hey, I promise you I will not let anything happen to you. Come here. Come here. (He embraces her.)
 Hey. Caroline is okay for now. I'm gonna check in on her later.
 It's taken care of.
 No, I'm gonna make sure that he's wrong.
 Not your normal day, huh?
 I'm sorry.
 Good night.
 It's almost dawn. Come with me.
 Well, I compelled the guard to on break so I could kiss my girlfriend on top of the Ferris wheel.
 We have to take these moments, Elena. What Katherine did to Caroline could just be the beginning and there are things with Tyler's family that we don't even understand yet and there's always the "D" word but I came back to this town to start a life with you. We can't forget to live it.
 I guess you'll just have to hold on tight.
 It's just so nice to see you laugh.
 No, it's not.
 Yeah, we were hoping you could help shed some light on the Lockwood family.
 You said that she had spent years researching this town.
 Is it?
 And at the school carnival his uncle Mason exhibited inhuman behavior when he fought with one of the carnival's workers.
 It suggests it's some sort of a supernatural entity.
 Are you sure you want to do this?
 Either, both.
 You know what? Maybe we should wait a couple days, huh? Wait until Caroline is less of a danger and then I could go with you.
 Listen, I want you to go okay? I do. You have questions about your lineage and about Katherine and...look I'm not gonna let the fact that Damon is going keep you from an opportunity to get some answers.
 I hate it but I love you.
 Call me if you need anything.
 Goodbye.
 Emily made mine, she made Damon's too, instructions must be in the Grimoire.
 Bonnie, you know how to drop vampires with a single look, okay? I think you can figure it out.
 No, we're not making it easier for her; we're just giving her the chance to survive. Listen, every day that she's cut off from her old life - from you, from Elena, from Matt, it'll make it that much harder for her to hold on to her humanity.
 I don't, but if we don't do everything we can to help her or at least trust the fact that she can keep it together, we might as well just stake her right now.
 Then trust me.
 No, no, she wants it.
 Caroline...
 Chase it, catch it, feed on it.
 Well, you sort of skipped the serial killer and went straight to vampire. Caroline, if you're not serious about all of this I think you should tell me.
 No, no, I'm not laughing. None of this is funny, trust me. It's just that...
 When someone becomes a vampire, all of their natural behaviors get sort of amplified.
 I mean...as a human I cared deeply for people, how they felt. If they were hurting I felt their pain and I felt guilty if I was the one who caused it and as a vampire all of that got...magnified.
 Well, I wasn't gonna say it like that but...hey, listen, let's hunt okay? And then after that we'll go to the swimming hole.
 Yeah. Matt is the closest connection that you have to your humanity and I think that being around him is a good thing.
 My what? My "vampire serious look"?
 I get it, okay. You think I'm...you think I'm too serious. Is that it?
 Hey, I saw that. You compelled her.
 Caroline, nobody deserves to have their mind messed with for shallow reasons.
 You're letting the jealousy get the best of you.
 I told you this wasn't gonna be easy.
 Go talk to him. I'll wait.
 Hey.
 What's up?
 I'll be careful.
 What is it?
 Listen, I gotta go. I'll see you when you get home, okay?
 Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop!
 No, no, no, stop. Listen to me. We need to get out of these woods now. We need to leave.
 Matt, stay down. Do not move.
 You and me, we're gonna run. It's going to follow us; we need to lead it away from Matt. You need to run as fast as you can. Do you understand me? Go, go!
 It's a werewolf! He will try to kill us and he can!
 What are you doing?
 I took care of it and I will get Matt on vervain, it'll keep you from being able to compel him and also to keep you from drinking his blood.
 I know.
 It's not going to get any easier. You're just gonna have to work that much harder.
 I'm the last person to make that kind of decision for you. If I had follow my own advice, I would walked away from Elena a long time ago.
 I know I should have, I just can't.
 I thought you didn't believe in rules.
 My brother is still upset that you chose me to escort you.
 Elena.
 Elena!
 Yeah. Yes, bad dream. Get back to sleep.
 Katherine.
 What do you want?
 Why are you back in town?
 You see, I can't quite get that down. Just kind of...gets stuck in my throat.
 You shouldn't read someone's journal.
 Damon's private stock.
 What do you know about werewolves?
 And...how do you know this?
 Founding families.
 The Lockwoods.
 I was your escort.
 So you're saying that all the Lockwoods are werewolves.
 How many werewolves are out there? I mean...is it just limited to the Lockwood's?
 What is it about you that makes me still care?
 Now, where were we? That's right; you were going to tell me why you came back to Mystic Falls, weren't you?
 Answer the question.
 We're gonna play by my rules now.
 Answer the question.
 I'll do whatever it takes to get you to tell me the truth.
 I don't want to hear any more stories about the past.
 What did he want?
 You know, we can sit here as long as you want. And when you start to desiccate, there's a tomb with your name on it.
 Actually, I don't pretend to be anything when I'm with her. That's the whole point. I get to just be myself.
 I don't.
 How long do you plan on staying in Mystic Falls?
 How could he not? Losing your family in the fire, gratefully you made it to Atlanta.
 Uh, very much so. I know...we've only known each other for a short while and I know I'm in competition for your affections but I've never met a woman quite like you. I look at you and I see an angel. I touch your skin and my entire body ignites. I kiss you and I know that I'm falling in love.
 I am in love with you.
 More to learn and love.
 I have upset you?
 It wasn't real, I remember you compelling me.
 Well, whatever feelings I had back then, they all turned to hate.
 What kind of a deal?
 You knew that they were gonna burn the vampires in the church?
 They were your friends, they were your family and you just sold them out.
 What did George get in return? For giving you your freedom.
 So you sent 26 of your friends to their death, just to fake your own? No, you were running from something. What was it?
 We came for you, we tried to save you.
 So then Damon and I died for nothing! For nothing!
 Are you gonna tell me why you came back here or you're just playing another game?
 Oh good, make it six.
 Come on Katherine. If you wanted Elena dead, you would have done it by now.
 Don't you ever think for one moment that I will not kill you.
 What? Why?
 Elena?!
 Are you okay?
 Not really.
 I'm starving.
 Listen, I know you're upset but we have to take her seriously. Today, was all about the lengths she would go to.
 Elena, you caught her off guard. It doesn't mean that you're safe.
 Well, you should be.
 If today taught me anything, is that Katherine is used to getting her way.
 Listen, she's sadistic, okay? She threatened you, she threatened everyone.
 This is the reality of our situation.
 She already has, Elena.
 Are you okay?
 I know me too. It felt too real.
 Yeah.
 It won't be long before Katherine gets a play by play.
 You're not wrong. It's pure Katherine. She's always finding somebody to do her dirty work.
 The only way Katherine is gonna believe it is if everybody believes it. That's the best way to make her think she's getting what she wants.
 It's not why she's here, okay? No matter what she says, I know her. Katherine doesn't care about anybody but herself, she never has. She's incapable of love. She's here for another reason.
 Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
 Hey.
 Are you ready for today?
 I know but if Katherine thinks that we are fighting, then she will think that she's winning and it keeps her from following through with her threats.
 Hey, everything's gonna be okay. Yes, we have to keep up this ruse for a little while but the best way to keep Katherine from hurting anybody, from hurting you.
 Okay, how about this? Today, when we're fighting, if I say "I can't do this anymore, Elena", what I'll really mean is that I love you.
 The nice one. The one offering an apology.
 Look, my brother acted impulsively.
 If you and Damon keep at each other throats, somebody innocent is going to get hurt and I don't want that. You have family here so I can imagine you'd want that either. So what do you say we just quit the whole alpha male fighting thing and call a truce?
 He made a mistake. I'm here to make sure that neither one of you make another one.
 Well, I'm guessing that he only has to worry about that during a full moon. Otherwise you're not as strong, am I right? Or you would have killed Damon by now. There's one of you. There's two of us. I think you're the one that needs to watch his back.
 He won't.
 Negotiating peace on your behalf.
 Consider it opposite day.
 No, actually I think that the first chance Mason Lockwood gets, he's gonna drive a stake through your heart and then through mine, all because you took it upon yourself to try to kill him. So thank you, because we don't have enough problems.
 Don't do this. Please don't turn this into something that it's not.
 No, I'm saying that this isn't up for discussion right now because we have ears on us.
 I don't know.
 You're reaching. I'm not...I'm not Damon.
 You know, I can't...I can't do this anymore, Elena.
 Please tell me that you were just bonding.
 What are you talking about?
 Drop it, Damon.
 What's wrong?
 Listen to me! Sit! Sit!
 Okay. I don't like it. He's making threats. He could expose us. We need to put him down.
 No. I'm gonna be fine. It's just gonna take a little bit longer.
 Damon, don't!
 Yeah, I'm feeling much better, thank you.
 Katherine took a little vervain every day and built up a tolerance to it...I could do the same with blood. I could learn to control myself on it.
 I almost died tonight, Elena. Because I was too weak.
 I told you I'll find a way to stop Katherine, didn't I? Well this is it, this is the only way because she's stronger than me. And unless that changes this, I can't protect you.
 He can hear us wherever we are, because he drinks this. This is...this is the only thing that can help me!
 No, this is real. No more pretend.
 You can come in.
 I don't know but if I don't try...
 Yeah, just a few drops of blood in my system. I think it's worth trying.
 What are you doing?
 You're staring.
 It's creepy.
 Yes, it is.
 Katherine who?
 Love it, let's go!
 Well, what do you know. So am I.
 I don't trust Mason. I want to be there today to keep an eye on him.
 No, none of that.
 Did it hurt?
 I promise you, we're gonna get through this.
 Hey.
 You know, Elena and I, we're kind of taking a - a pause.
 Yeah.
 Hey, Mason.
 Yeah, I had this little accident. But I'm fine now.
 Oh, she's fine too, but from now on, you'll have to do your own dirty work.
 What's the matter? Are you okay?
 What do you mean? Like a vision?
 You saw Elena?
 No, Bonnie, Elena wouldn't kiss...You didn't see Elena, you saw...Katherine.
 We missed it. He got into town right after she did. It makes perfect sense.
 Using him for what?
 Why?
 So, how are we gonna find this moonstone?
 Why would you involve Jeremy?
 I know how you feel about helping us out, but since you're the one that linked Mason with Katherine, we finally have an opportunity to get an upper hand on both of them so, just hear us out.
 I have to fill Elena in on what's going on.
 Can you play nice, please?
 Hey, what are you doing? You shouldn't be calling me.
 Alright, it's okay. Hold on.
 Yeah, he meant that as a question with a "please" on the end.
 He, uh, he took off. He said he wasn't sure when he'd be back.
 You shouldn't be here.
 Bonnie thinks the moonstone is down here.
 I'll only be down there for a minute.
 Elena!!!
 Elena!!!
 Vervain. Oh, God! Help!
 Yep.
 I see you've exercised your usual restraint.
 Let's get rid of the body.
 No, no, no! Don't provoke her!
 I'm so sorry.
 I know.
 I know what you're gonna say to me.
 Elena, I...
 What happened?
 Where?
 What was the message?
 She wants to do it in public. Killing Mason threw her off guard.
 We can't underestimate her. We have to play this smarter than her.
 You're not gonna kill her.
 You're not gonna kill her.
 Because I am.
 Hey, you brought the grimoire, thank you.
 I can explain.
 We're gonna kill Katherine.
 Look, I want Elena back, yes but it's more than that. What Katherine did to Jenna it crossed the line. She has to be stopped before it happens again.
 Katherine knows me, right? She knows that I'm not gonna try something in a crowd full of innocent people so that gives me an edge. I could catch her by surprise.
 Right. We can isolate her, away from the others. Please Bonnie.
 No, I need you to stay with Elena. I don't want her to know about this.
 Alright, if anybody wants to back out, I'll understand.
 Bonnie? Are you with us?
 Nope. You're sure you can do this?
 Oh, I had the chance to kill her and I hesitated.
 You spent 145 years loving her, it could happen.
 Okay.
 No.
 Why the charade?
 Katherine?
 I don't want anyone to get hurt tonight.
 Well, you see, I don't have the moonstone on me. So, you and I will have to go get it together.
 My way or you don't get it.
 I put the body in the trunk for now.
 This is exactly what I didn't want it, Damon.
 Right, which is why we need to call it off.
 All right.
 Hello Katherine.
 No, but he can.
 Jeremy, go check on Elena. Make sure she's okay. Go!
 Oh, why don't you two stop antagonizing each other?
 What do you want with it?
 That was really desperate, Katherine. Don't you think that we can see right through you?
 Oh, stop it.
 You know, this whole Mason thing has me a bit confused. Why a werewolf? The moonstone can break a curse that would help them destroy all vampires so what's in that for you?
 You bargained the moonstone.
 When you struck a deal with George Lockwood, to help you fake your death, you told me that you gave George something that he needed. It was the moonstone, wasn't it?
 Why do you need it back?
 What were you doing with it in the first place?
 Unless it wasn't yours to begin with. In 1864 you faked your death. Who were you running from, Katherine?
 Who were you running from?
 No, no! Damon, don't!
 Wait, Elena!
 Elena.
 I know but I think you should definitely see a doctor anyway.
 Yeah, I was so worried about you.
 Katherine being gone doesn't change anything for you, does it?
 Yeah. Yeah, I...I understand.
 Hey Jeremy.
 What are you talking about?
 Wait, wait...hold on a minute. We're not back together.
 No, I mean I saw her at the party but that was it. She didn't sleep over.
 This has Katherine written all over it.
 Did you?
 Well, I know the hold that Katherine has on you.
 What did she say?
 What? And you didn't think you should ask her to elaborate?
 We have to go talk to her.
 I don't really care.
 It's Elena.
 But I can open the door, right? I can talk to her?
 I know but Bonnie I have to do something. I have no idea who has Elena; I have no idea where she is.
 Alright, Alaric said we've got to clear out of here within ten minutes. I've got weapons, he stocked me up.
 No, Bonnie. We need a more exact location than that.
 Perfect. Call me with whatever you find.
 No Jeremy, you're not.
 She's not. You two go back to your house just in case. I'll call you the minute I find her.
 You're coming with me?
 I don't know, it's a vervain bomb or a grenade launcher or something like that.
 Hey, how much further is it?
 Who do you think took her?
 Thank you for helping me.
 Oh, come on Damon. We both know that you being in this car has absolutely nothing to do with me anyway.
 Well, it doesn't have to be an elephant. Let's talk about it.
 That's not true. I'm sure there is. Just get it out. I mean, are you in this car because you want to help your little brother save the girl that he loves? Or is it because you love her too? Hmm? I mean come on, express yourself. I happen to like road trip bonding.
 No, you see that's the beauty of it. You can't.
 We're getting close. Jeremy said there's an access road just past mile marker 6.
 I want some.
 I'm not joking. I've been drinking a little every day. I'm slowly increasing my intake and building up my strength.
 I've been drinking hers.
 You mean when I was more like you?
 I guess he found something else to live for.
 What is your point?
 And?
 Yeah, I'm certain I want to do it.
 Alright, then I won't come out.
 I can't think of a better reason to die, but if you want to stay here, I'll totally understand.
 Up here.
 Hey come here. Are you hurt? Are you okay?
 She's home.
 Because she wanted to be with Jeremy.
 Thanks. Listen, um, what Rose told Elena about the curse...
 You know, the only way we're gonna be able to do that is if we're not fighting each other. We let Katherine come between us. If we let that happen with Elena, we're not gonna be able to protect her.
 Hey.
 I'm sorry.
 For being the guy who made you turn 145 years ago.
 You know what? I've never said it out loud. I guess I just need to say it and you need to hear it. I'm sorry. What I did was selfish. I didn't want to be alone. I guess I just needed my brother.
 Who's there?
 Why are you here?
 You knew Lexi?
 Well, I'm sorry but I can't help you.
 What do you mean "it's not over"?
 For who?
 Hey.
 From the first generation of vampires.
 Klaus is known to be the oldest.
 No.
 Look, Elijah's dead, right? So no one else even knows that you exist.
 Look, I've never even met anyone who's laid eyes on him. I mean, we're talking centuries of truth mixed with fiction. We don't know if he's real. For all we know he could just be some sort of stupid bed time story.
 Where are you going?
 Let me grab my stuff, I'll go with you.
 Shut up, Damon.
 Hey.
 Well, Elena went home sick; I just want to go check up on her.
 I'm kind of worried about her.
 Uh, talk about what?
 What did you do?
 Yeah, what else did you say to him?
 Yes Caroline. As a matter of fact, I am a little mad. I mean, you put yourself a risk. If Damon finds out...
 No, of course not. He would kill you.
 Yeah. Well, you don't exactly make it very easy on me.
 I don't know. I guess you...you remind me of someone. My best friend, Lexi.
 You say that with such a discouraging amount of surprise, Caroline.
 I will, some other time. I got to go.
 Okay, now I'm leaving.
 No, no, no, Caroline, you have two seconds to come clean.
 I'd believe the whole innocent act a little bit better if I didn't know how good you were at providing a distraction on demand. Where is Elena?
 You can't tell me? Are you kidding me?
 Caroline! Elena was kidnapped, she could have been killed and you're seriously not gonna tell me where she is?
 Put herself in danger where? What do you...? She's with Damon, isn't she?
 Then where...where is she? Listen, if you're my friend like you've been pretending to be all day, then you'll tell me where she is.
 Elena.
 I could ask you the same question.
 No, she kept your secret but it didn't take long for me to figure out what was the important that you'd have to keep it from me.
 Listen to me, whatever she said to you is a lie. Do not listen to her. She's a liar, Elena.
 You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
 No, look at me. No, do not listen to her, okay?
 Oh no, there it is. It's the ultimate lie, isn't it? You spun this whole thing so that we would have to get the stone from you, didn't you?
 No, let me guess. You want to trade that stone for your freedom, you manipulative, psychotic bitch.
 Elena.
 You have to. Don't shut me out. Elena, please.
 Hey. Uh, can we talk?
 We're here for the moonstone.
 I thought you liked it in here. Nice and safe where Klaus can't get to you.
 According to Rose's friend Slater, there's a way to destroy the spell that Klaus wants to break.
 By releasing it from the moonstone.
 She agreed to do anything she could to help us.
 We're gonna get it from her.
 Bonnie just needs to find a way to release the seal long enough for us to get in, get the moonstone, and get out in time for her to return it.
 What are you talking about? Elena, we don't have a choice.
 We'll find him right after we get the moonstone.
 Elena, if we can de-spell the moonstone, we can save your life.
 She hasn't been feeding. She's weaker. We're not.
 This belonged to Katherine. Found it with her things after I thought she was dead, but it was hers.
 Still gotta get the torches.
 What the hell?
 Where the hell is Damon?
 She's fed, she has her strength back.
 I don't have a choice.
 How long?
 Just get me in there as soon as you can.
 Bonnie....Bonnie....
 You need to stop. Bonnie!
 Bonnie!
 Bonnie. Bonnie, wake up, please. Bonnie, wake up. Bonnie.
 Are you okay? You all right?
 Go!
 Yeah.
 Ah, it's all right. I'll handle myself. Bonnie has the moonstone. Work with her. Try to figure out how to de-spell it.
 Keep Elena away from here.
 Promise me. No matter what happens. You'll protect her.
 You trapped her in the house?
 Give that to me and I'm just gonna have to share it with her.
 Don't worry about me. Just make sure Elena's safe.
 The pleasure I'll get from watching you suffer is greater than any pain I'll ever feel.
 Stop.
 Stay out of my head.
 We could talk about how you regret all you've done to make my life miserable.
 Look where it has gotten you.
 You want me to believe you? Show me. Do something. Prove to me that there's something inside of you that's actually worth trusting.
 Maybe and maybe I'll see that there's still hope for you after all.
 Am I?
 Let me guess  you know where he is.
 For a price I'm sure.
 What? By who?
 I can't.
 Goodbye Katherine.
 Elena? Hey.
 Yep.
 Good morning.
 Me neither, but...
 I'm totally ruining the moment. Look, I can't just pretend like everything is okay.
 I know but we still have this pressing little issue of you being Klaus' human sacrifice.
 Right. As long as you play by his rules.
 Katherine said Isobel could have some answers and I just have a couple questions, that's all.
 Right, you made a deal with him. I didn't make one. You should keep your deal.
 When have I ever wanted somebody to get hurt?
 Yes, bottoms up.
 Yeah.
 He's an original. I don't really know what that means. I don't think anybody really knows what that means. Well, except maybe Isobel. Maybe we should ask her.
 Is that the-?
 So you're doing his dirty work for him now.
 Do you still know of a way to get in touch with Isobel?
 Katherine said that Isobel knew of Klaus.
 No harm in giving it to me then?
 I know that.
 Isobel, it's Stefan Salvatore. I need to speak with you, it's about Elena. Please know that it's important.
 I'm waiting for you. Listen, there's a lot of people here.
 Hey, listen, I know you're upset about Rose.
 Rose?
 I um...I called Isobel.
 I'm sorry, I had to.
 I went to go look for Isobel, and I get John instead. He said he can help us, and we're desperate.
 Damon, Bonnie's new witch friend is working with Elijah, so we have to assume that the moonstone was never destroyed . Elena is putting all of her faith into some deal that she made with Elijah to keep everyone safe. I mean, do you trust Elijah? I don't trust him. He's an Original, he can't be trusted. It's not like we can just go up and kill him, because apparently, he can't die!
 He knew about the sacrifice, Isobel told him. He said he knew of a way to keep Elena safe.
 He's not talking. At least not to me anyway.
 Hey, I'm sorry about Rose.
 And you cared about her after five minutes. I wonder what that means?
 What's wrong?
 It's that woman, Jules. She had a run-in with Damon.
 Wow, this is bad.
 No! He already wants to kill him. He thinks all werewolves should die, and he's not wrong to think that, Caroline. I mean, what if Tyler tries to retaliate? He has every right to. He could get himself killed.
 I'm not gonna hurt you, I just want to talk.
 Would you have let me in otherwise?
 Shh. Not a word.
 Maybe we're getting off on the wrong foot, here.
 Tyler, there's a lot for us to talk about.
 I wouldn't do that. Without a full moon, you're no match for me.
 Look, about Caroline, no matter what her flaws are, when push comes to shove, you're gonna want that girl on your side. She's your friend, stop being a dick to her.
 That's some sort of leftover idea from another time. It doesn't have to be that way anymore. We go to the same school, we have the same friends. we keep the same secrets. This can work, Tyler. I mean, it's your home, it's my home too. I want this to work.
 Who's number was that, hm?
 Damn it Tyler! I'm trying to save your life, can't you see that?
 I don't know what else to say to you Tyler. I came back to this town because I wanted a life, I wanted to exist where I could have friends and where I could build a family. I have that here, we can both have that.
 Hey. Is everything okay?
 Who is this?
 Jules? Where's Caroline?
 Where is she?
 Hurt her again and you're dead.
 Where's Caroline?
 Let her go, and I'll release Tyler. It doesn't have to get any messier than it already has. I'm not your enemy, Jules.
 You need to leave town. No one else has to get hurt.
 Tyler is free to make his own decisions, as soon as you release Caroline.
 I don't know about that.
 So is your mom home?
 I can come in, if you want me to.
 You don't have to pretend with me. Anybody would be upset after what you went through tonight.
 Sure you can.
 Okay.
 Good night.
 Elena.
 I'm fine.
 I could use your help...
 Hey!
 I was a bit worried about you, after everything you went through tonight.
 Good. But, just in case, I brought some back up.
 How was the slumber party?
 Mmm. That can be arranged.
 Even with everything that's going on?
 And you're sure this has nothing to do with dodging your father who just got into town?
 Well, in that case, where would you like to go?
 Ready for our romantic weekend?
 Mmm. I'll go put these in the car.
 Uh, please tell me there's nothing wrong.
 You all right?
 Oh, my god. 
 Okay.
 Oh, that's great because I'm, uh...I'm stuck.
 Not gonna be a very romantic weekend unless you, uh, invite me inside.
 What?
 You're kidding me, right?
 You are such a liar.
 Having another moment?
 I think there are a lot of conversations to be had about our future, about the kind of life we could have together.
 Oh, we can open it. Whenever you're ready.
 You know, this is a future memory. It's where your boyfriend whispered to you that he loved you. 
 And your mom?
 Oh, yeah. I'll go get more wood.
 No, no. It's cold outside.
 I look hot in your dead great-granddad's jacket?
 Huh.
 This is hollow inside.
 It's a really good hiding place.
 I'll go get the firewood. I'll let you have a moment.
 Just let me get the bullet out. It punctured my heart. I need to get it out. I'm not gonna fight you.
 Tyler, why are you doing this?
 You know about the curse?
 No. I swear to you. We don't want to break the curse, Tyler. We don't want to do that.
 Tyler, I'm just trying to save Elena.
 They didn't tell you that part, did they? Who are the liars now?
 In order to break the curse, Elena has to die.
 It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.
 You're all right. It's okay.
 Be careful. Try not to get yourself killed.
 That was, um...that was Damon. We need to talk.
 He learned that Elijah's planning for you to die in the sacrifice ritual.
 You mean, you knew that you weren't gonna survive this?
 Elena, how...how could you stand out there earlier with me, talking about making plans for our future, when you don't even expect to have one?
 No. What you're doing is you're being a martyr.
 Because I've already lived. 162 years I have lived, and you've barely begun, and now you want to let yourself get killed? That's not heroic. It's tragic.
 What's going on?
 That makes one of us.
 How do you know?
 ...killing Elijah.
 Well, it's not going to be easy. He's crafty.
 He's an Original. We don't know what all that encompasses.
 Wow, Damon, tell me you're actually gonna be careful for once?
 Yeah, I'm still mad.
 Elena, you've agreed to sacrifice yourself to Klaus. To say that we have a difference of opinion is the understatement of the century.
 What does Johnathan Gilbert have to say?
 We were, uh...We were angry at the founding families for what they did to Katherine. We wanted revenge. I didn't know about Johnathan Gilbert's ring yet. I didn't know that he would (He sits down)...that he would survive.
 That's what I was. I want you to know the truth...But I want you to hear it from me. In the weeks after I became a vampire, I relished in it. I took it to the darkest place I could.
 Who wants to die next?
 What about you? You know if you don't pick up the tempo, you're going to lose your head. Snap. Snap.
 I brought enough to share.
 Damon, if you're worried about the Founding Families, please don't be. They're all dead or about to be.
 Damon, don't be like this. I'm just having some fun.
 Look where that got her.
 You hate me. I know. I know. An eternity of misery and on and on. I know, but you don't have to leave town. Damon, I'll do better. I promise.
 I wasn't myself then. I was full of guilt. What I did to my father, to my brother. I had to turn it off. It was the only way I could survive.
 I was worse.
 For weeks I kept spiraling. I was completely driven by the desire for blood. Hunt, prey, kill. That was all I knew.
 Mmm. There was a war going on. The thing about wartime. Endless, anonymous blood supply.
 Alexia Branson, as she was known back then.
 She had heard it was a good place for vampires. You know, had no idea that they'd all been massacred. Needed a place to crash, so I brought her home with me.
 I, um...I meant to dispose of those.
 A what?
 Talking about her brings up things that I'd rather forget.
 You're kidding.
 Elena...
 I know it does...
 Because John gave it to Damon.
 John's trying to get Damon killed.
 Why is your phone off? Call me.
 Damon is planning on killing Elijah. Tonight.
 Elena, we need to talk about this.
 You're gonna what? Hmm? What are you gonna do, Elena?
 Yeah, exactly. It's your life and I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure that you live it.
 I was telling you about a time when I thought that everything was lost. When I had given up because that is exactly what you're doing right now.
 Yes, it is! Even if you don't want to admit it. You are giving up...and Lexi? She wouldn't let me give up. I'm not gonna let you.
 Nothing. I feel nothing.
 Is that not the point?
 Is it better?
 Why would I want to do that? Hmm?
 Lexi showed me that there was another way. And from that day forward, I started fighting for it. For my own survival.
 That's all I want you to do. I just want you to fight for it.
 Elijah's dead. Alaric did it.
 He's here.
 Elena...
 Okay.
 I told her a little story about when I was making the wrong decisions and somebody showed me there was a better way.
 Yeah. You remember her?
 Let's be later.
 School?
 Doesn't ring a bell.
 Five minutes?!
 What the hell's going on here?
 How could you do this?!
 Stop it, Katherine!
 How's that possible?
 Like hell.
 She wants what we want...Klaus dead. Maybe she sees us as her only chance.
 So do I. But you're right, she stayed. Shouldn't we at least try to figure out why?
 Look, I hate it as much as you do, but she does make a point. We don't know anything about Klaus. She does.
 Maybe we should stay at your place tonight.
 Yeah. We're dealing with it, all right? Just be extra careful. She's gotten a little too good at impersonating Elena.
 Listen, I want to get the Martins on our side. I want to figure out a way for us all to work together now that Elijah's out of the picture.
 It's either win them over or somebody's going to end up dead. You think you can at least convince them to have a civil conversation?
 Thanks. Keep me posted.
 Thank you for coming.
 Elijah's dead. I'm sorry.
 Hear me out. We can help you.
 I suspect that you and Elijah had a plan to kill Klaus. Let us help you carry it out. You can trust us. I give you my word. We all do.
 Isn't she gone or dead yet?
 Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus but he believed that if a witch could channel enough power...They wouldn't need one.
 We just need to find it.
 Well, nothing in any of these. Find anything?
 That's too bad.
 What are you doing?!
 Jonas is here and he's after Elena.
 We have a plan, but I need to get Elena out of here.
 When did you guys get home?
 Did you check the house?
 Everything's taken care of.
 Isobel just showed up at their front doorstep.
 I don't know. That's what I'm gonna go find out.
 What? Why?
 What do you know?
 Tell you what. Why don't you, uh...Call Alaric and let him know that his wife just showed up on his girlfriend's doorstep.
 How could you let him go?
 Did your mom hear anything?
 All right. Listen. You have to find him. You have to calm him down. Compel him if you have to. Is he still on the vervain?
 Yeah.
 All right. What do you know?
 Best chance at what?
 Were you able to find Klaus?
 Look, I don't trust a word that she says, but I think we'd be stupid to ignore the warning.
 What, in the house that any vampire can enter? No. Her house is safer.
 That'd be me.
 Hey. Any luck finding Matt?
 No, we just gotta find him and make sure that doesn't happen.
 Do you have any idea where he would be?
 Maybe he'll come around. You did.
 Uh, he's-he's bleeding. Is he okay?
 You okay?
 Let's get out of here. Come on.
 Tell him he needs to get over here and deal with John's body.
 Where the hell is she, huh?
 Think this is the house?
 Swear to God if she's not here...
 I got upstairs.
 Where are they?
 Is that Isobel's?
 She was your mother.
 Well, anything John told Isobel, we have to assume that Klaus knows, right? So he knows that you're not gonna turn yourself into a vampire. He knows that you have us keeping you safe.
 It's the deed to our house. It's in Zach's name. As soon as you sign it, it'll be in your name.
 Isobel had the right idea with the safe house. You'll just stay here till it's all over. That way, you can control who gets invited and who doesn't.
 At least something went right today. Katherine has no idea that Bonnie got her powers back.
 And Isobel had no idea what you and Jeremy took Bonnie to do today.
 We're the only ones who know.
 She said she could channel enough witch's power to kill him. Elijah thought that would work and he was an Original, so...
 Yeah.
 Nope. Not without something that belongs to Klaus. Believe me, I already asked.
 Katherine? Probably.
 I would love to. Thank you.
 Wait, where are you going?
 Huh?
 Yeah, guys, Klaus is out there. We know that.
 Wait, um, coming.
 Really? How are we going to do that? We don't even know what he looks like.
 He could be anywhere at any time. He compelled somebody at school.
 I guess it's not as safe as you guys thought, huh?
 Well, I was impressed.
 Ooh. You know it's not too late to back out, right?
 Hey.
 And tonight, we will put an end to him.
 I want you to tell me that when the night's over.
 You guys ready to do this?
 Maybe he's not here. Just wants us to believe that he is.
 I'm on it.
 Hey, guys.
 Hey. Do you mind if I steal your date for a moment?
 Thanks.
 Klaus is here.
 Yeah.
 We have no idea. But keep your eye out for anything that might be weird, okay?
 Everything all right?
 Jeremy. What are you doing? Elena thinks we should stick together.
 What is it? Hey, you got something on your mind, spit it out.
 What?
 Come here, come here, come here. Please tell me you didn't know that Bonnie was on a suicide mission.
 Yeah, I told her. You promised her no more secrets.
 No, no, no, no, don't kill him. He's compelled.
 So, the whole thing's a distraction. Go find Bonnie and Elena. I got this. Go.
 Where is she?
 Damn it, Damon, where is she?!
 It's too late. I'm sorry.
 Hey, hey, hey.
 Hey. Here, drink this.
 Yeah. Yeah, you can. Please drink this.
 No, no, no, no, no. No. Hey. This was Klaus. Listen to me. Klaus did this.
 You know, you could have told me.
 You understand what you put her through?
 Elena!
 Hey.
 Have you seen Elena?
 Hey, where's Elena?
 Hey, it's me. Where are you? Call me.
 What are you doing? She's not a wind-up toy.
 Where are you? Are you okay?
 Where's Elijah?
 Where? I'm on my way.
 Listen to me. He can't be trusted he'll use you to get to Klaus.
 You can't do this alone.
 She did.
 If anyone can get him to help us kill Klaus, it's her.
 She'll kill herself in the process. Elena's looking for another way.
 No, you need to back off.
 Look, I don't like this any more than you do. But we need to trust her. We gotta just let her do her thing.
 I said back off.
 Hello?
 Jenna, hey.
 Ah, Elena's not here at the moment. Is, uh, is everything okay?
 It's really hard to explain over the phone, but, um, she was hoping that you could stay on campus for a little while longer.
 Wait, you're home?
 Jenna, listen to me carefully. Whatever you do, do not meet Alaric at the Grill. I'm going to come over right now and I'll explain everything.
 It's seriously going to be like this?
 Hey, Jenna. Thank you so much for not going to the Grill.
 No, listen. I can explain.
 In literature. Bram Stoker. It's dense, but I appreciate it.
 You heard her.
 Jenna, get out of here now!
 Watch me!
 Jenna, go.
 I said go!
 Is she gonna be okay?
 I'm so sorry, Elena. I hate this.
 Wait, what? No, no!
 Oh.
 Let her go.
 You heard me. I said let her go.
 Tired of your little play thing already?
 She's a person. You're victimizing her.
 You're right. Thank you for being in love with my girlfriend.
 There it is. You know, you can be in love with Elena all you want...If it means that you'll protect her. But I have the one thing that you never will.
 Her respect.
 I'm sorry for the part that I played in your death. I was protecting Elena. I will always protect Elena.
 He's angry with me right now. But he'll come around.
 Elena said that the Sun and the Moon curse is fake? That it's actually just a curse placed on Klaus.
 Damon...
 All right, how do we break this curse?
 The moonstone.
 Breakfast of champions, huh?
 You know, you're not helping.
 What do you want me to do, Damon? Elena made her decision. She's choosing to trust Elijah. I'm going to put my faith in her.
 Because she put her faith in me. She chose to trust me in spite of what I am. I'm going to bet on somebody's instincts, it's going to be hers.
 She chose to trust you, too.
 Why did he let you go?
 So you don't remember anything that happened?
 She's under compulsion. Damon snuck her some vervain, but she can't leave until Klaus tells her she can.
 What did you do?! Huh? What did you do?!
 As a vampire! She'll come back a vampire!
 How could you, of all people, take that choice away from her?
 I'm so sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 Thank you. Both of you.
 Hey. We've never talked about this. What this all means.
 Of course it matters. Hey. It matters. I want you to go somewhere with me.
 No, no, it's not far, okay? It's just for the day. I promise.
 It's a surprise. Just a little bit longer.
 Ready to talk about how you're feeling about all this?
 I think you do know how you feel. I just want you to know that it's okay to tell me.
 Well, if you don't want to, that's your choice. Today's about you. But...It's a long way to the top. Let's go. You never know what might come up.
 Oh, yeah.
 No, it's your last day as a human. Why cheat now?
 Yeah, piece of cake.
 I definitely wouldn't recommend doing that.
 Ahh. You feel like you could do anything. Be anyone. Beautiful things are more beautiful. Everything's heightened, you just live more intensely, love more powerfully.
 Ah, you know the worst.
 Anger becomes rage. When you're sad, you're in despair. Grief. Loss. It can cripple you. That's why so many of us turn our emotions off. It just becomes...Too overwhelming. You know, for a while, for me, the good just wasn't worth the bad.
 Well, I'm still trying. Every day. What else?
 That's nothing, if you've climbed Mt. Everest.
 Yeah. Hey, you can say it.
 The thing you've been wanting to say, but...Been afraid of how it'll make me feel.
 Might make you feel better. Look, I know this isn't the first time you've thought about it. Drinking vampire blood to survive. I mean, I know I've thought about it a hundred times.
 Of course I did. Elena...If it were my choice, I'd want to be with you forever.
 'Cause I knew if it was an option, you would have. It would be selfish for me to ask you.
 He shouldn't have done what he did. He did it because he loves you.
 Hey, say it.
 I know. It's okay.
 No.
 I love you.
 Where's Damon?
 What the hell are you doing?
 She's already gone, Damon.
 Klaus came. He took her.
 And you're sure Bonnie will survive this?
 Damon.
 Cut to the chase. Is the sacrifice happening or not?
 We're sticking with the original plan. We're meeting Bonnie right now.
 What?
 Oh, my god.
 Klaus was going to use Tyler and Caroline. But Damon rescued them.
 Bonnie...If you use that much power, you'll be dead. We've already been through this. It's not an option.
 We're going to offer another vampire. One that he'll want more. Me.
 I'll head over there first and you'll follow with Bonnie when it's time.
 Are you? Because this whole plan is, um, it's contingent upon your honor, Elijah.
 Klaus is your brother. I know I've wanted to kill my brother a thousand times. I've never been able to.
 You want revenge.
 Please end this.
 I'm here to talk.
 You don't need to kill Jenna. I'll take her place.
 
 Just make the trade. Me for Jenna.
 It's okay.
 No.
 I'm so sorry.
 
 Elena.
 I need you to get her out of here!
 I'm not leaving until he's dead. Go!
 Elijah! Don't listen to him.
 No!
 We all set?
 She lost the only parents she had. She's in shock.
 We're going to head back to the house.
 Damon, she needs us right now. All of us.
 I have no idea.
 I'm not going to let Elena lose anybody else.
 What's that supposed to mean?
 We'll find something. A cure.
 We kept Elena human, right? We found the way when there was no way. Hey.
 I will do this.
 You're not doing this.
 I don't care. You're not dying today.
 I'm gonna find a way out of this.
 I got Bonnie looking for something, anything.
 Lie still. Conserve your strength.
 I need your help.
 Damon's dying.
 Tyler Lockwood bit him. We don't have much time.
 You've done a sÃ©ance before, right? Contacted Emily Bennett. Maybe one of the witches might know how to help Damon.
 Bonnie? Bonnie?
 I need your help. I need to know if there's a spell that can heal a werewolf bite.
 Is that true...or are you just saying no because it's Damon?
 No. That's not balance. That's punishment.
 So you're saying that there's an answer to give? Please, if you know something, just tell me. Help me save my brother.
 Bonnie.
 They know something. There's an answer. They just don't want to tell me.
 What was it?
 Hey.
 Will you come take a walk with me?
 I know. I wish this could wait, but it can't. Listen, um, the other night when Damon was helping Tyler, something happened. Tyler was starting to transform, and Damon was bitten.
 Yeah.
 He told me not to tell you, but I figured if you wanted to talk to him, I...I wouldn't wait.
 It's not over. There might be a cure, but I have to find Klaus to get it.
 No, he had the chance to kill me, but he didn't. Whatever Damon's done, whatever has led him here, I'm the one that made him become a vampire in the first place, so if there's a chance for a cure, I owe it to him to find it.
 Go talk to him. Just tell him that there's still hope.
 Hello, Katherine.
 We ran into complications.
 Doesn't really matter. I just need to find him. Do you have any idea where he might be?
 I need your help...For my brother.
 The witches said you had a cure. Make me a deal. Just give me the cure, and I'll do whatever you want.
 I haven't been that way in a very long time.
 Your blood is the cure.
 I'm not like that anymore.
 Wait.
 No more. Not until you give me the cure.
 No!
 She'll never take it to him.
 She'll never take it to him.
 You won't be seeing her again, you know.
 What is it you really want from me?
 Then are we done here? Can we go?
 I wouldn't do that.
 Tell you what Ray, We're gonna play a little drinking game, something I like to call truth or wolfsbane.
 Ray, you can end this right now. Just tell me where your pack gathers for the full moon.
 I know, I know. You live by code and all that, but see he's not gonna let me stop until you tell me. And I do whatever he says so, that's the way it goes around here.
 My brother still on our trail?
 No, no, no! Let me handle it.
 Cause, you'll know I'll come back.
 You saved my brother's life; I'm at your service.
 I'll make sure that my brother doesn't bother us any more. (Then Stefan walks away.)
 Hello brother.
 Need you to stop following me. Causing some problems.
 What you're supposed to do is let me go.
 See the thing is, uh, I don't need any saving. I just want you to let me go.
 You know, maybe I haven't made my point. Hey, Andie you still there?
 Aw, come on! A little bit cool. Huh? Hey, Andie. You can move now.
 I said let me go!
 Did you doubt me?
 Nah, I don't care about anything anymore.
 I'm fine.
 You know, I get that we're, uh...we're stuck together, but if we could maybe just skip the chitchat, it'd be great.
 Maybe it's 'cause I'm a little tired of hunting werewolves. We've been at it all summer.
 Are any of you human? Your friend here needs human blood to complete his transition to vampire. If he doesn't get it, he will die.
 If you don't drink it, Ray, I will. Problem is I don't know how to stop.
 So is this your master plan? Build an army of hybrid slaves?
 For what war, might I ask?
 What makes you so sure that they'll be loyal?
 That's why you're, uh...you're keeping me around? To witness my attitude adjustment?
 That shouldn't be happening, should it?
 Some master race.
 He, uh...he got away. Forget him. Let's go.
 Yeah. I'm gonna need your blood to heal me.
 Can't be serious.
 What part of "don't follow me anymore" got lost in translation, Damon?
 I didn't call her.
 She has to. Because I'm never coming back. Why don't you get her home? See if you could keep her there this time.
 Last I checked, I'm dying...and you don't want to heal me.
 I had to take him out. I didn't have a choice. I failed you. I'm sorry. Do what you have to do.
 What are we doing here?
 Blacked out most of them. A lot of blood, a lot of partying. The details are all a blur.
 Save me a dance, Gloria.
 Ooh. Please, help yourself.
 No, no, no. Who are you?
 Yeah, well, I'll take your word for it. Like I said, I don't remember most of it.
 Why am I still with you? We had our fun, your hybrids failed. I mean, don't you want to move on?
 I am so sorry, sweetheart. Are we offending you?
 Ahem. Hey, hey. You ever going to tell me your name?
 I can't believe this place is still here.
 Yeah. You're Gloria. Shouldn't you be...
 Yeah, sure thing.
 What is this?
 But this is me. With you.
 This doesn't make any sense. Why don't I remember you?
 No, if you knew me, then why haven't you said anything?
 What the hell is going on? Answer me.
 It's beautiful.
 And is it?
 Who is this guy?
 Your sister. So I knew another Original vampire.
 I don't recognize her.
 Look, why don't you just tell me what the hell is going on? I mean, you obviously want me here for a reason, right?
 Do I?
 Hmm. And where's the rest of your family?
 And you're okay with that?
 I don't know. I give up.
 Lila? Lila, please. Come here for a second.
 Oh, no, no, no, no. No. You're sitting.
 Thank you so much, Lila. Why don't you go and bandage that up?
 I'd like you to join me for a drink.
 I said, drink!
 I didn't catch your name.
 Do you want another sip?
 Liam Grant! Have another sip, Liam.
 Finish it.
 Why should I believe any of this?
 Where are you going?
 How?
 April, 1922. Lexi found me last night. Dragged me off the train tracks. Thinks she can make me care again.
 June, 1924. Lexi's driving me crazy. More animal blood, more misery.
 1935. Cravings are there, but it's easier. Lexi's on to her next project  getting me to laugh.
 It's been vacant for decades. People must break in all the time. Why'd you bring me here?
 To write it down.
 Look what I found.
 1918. Single malt.
 So this is why you asked me to be your wingman? Because you liked the way that I tortured innocent people?
 What's the other half?
 They're jealous. Your family wants you dead because they can never be what you are.
 No. A king.
 Mmm!
 I appreciate the advice.
 You know what, you're a good friend, Nik. I'm glad I met you.
 So I'm confused. If we were such great friends, then why do I only know you as the hybrid dick who sacrificed my girlfriend on an altar of fire? Huh?
 They're using wooden bullets. They know.
 Who? Who's here?
 What the hell is going on?
 What are you talking about?
 You compelled me to forget?
 But why? You shouldn't have to cover your tracks...unless you're running from someone.
 I need another drink. A real one.
 What is wrong with you?!
 Klaus almost saw Elena today. You have to get her out of Chicago.
 She is the key to everything. Klaus can't know that she's alive.
 She was supposed to die in the sacrifice and she didn't. Now Klaus can't create any new hybrids. His witch is seconds away from figuring that out. Tell Elena to go home and forget about me.
 You shouldn't be here.
 What do you want? Damon won't be able to distract Klaus for long.
 How much clearer can I make it?
 I don't want to come home!
 Klaus is obsessed with siring these hybrids. The second he knows you're alive, he'll figure out why it's not working.
 And what do you expect if I do? Huh? It's never going to be the same, Elena.
 I don't think you do. I've left bodies scattered from Florida to Tennessee. Innocent people. Humans.
 And you know what I did after that? I spent thirty years trying to pull myself together. To a vampire, that's nothing. To you? That's half your life.
 Yes, you can. It's done. That part of my life is done. I don't want to see you. I don't want to be with you. I just want you to go.
 Rebekah.
 Hey, buddy, take a picture of my brother and me.
 I remember you. We were friends.
 I'm not afraid of you.
 I've never seen those people before in my life.
 It's dance music.
 Hmm.
 I like it.
 What? I said I like it.
 You're the one that pulled the dagger out of her.
 All right. I'm going to get some fresh air.
 What the hell are you doing here?
 You know, if he finds out you're in Chicago, you're dead.
 Goodbye, Katherine.
 They don't know where the necklace is. I just have to keep them from figuring it out. I have it all under control.
 Well, if the most diabolical woman I know can't seem to figure it out, then I must be doing something right.
 Happy to know you still care.
 Yeah, sorry. Retail therapy was making my head explode.
 What's she doing?
 She's, uh, she's looking for the necklace, huh?
 Hey. Hey, you know, why don't we just come back later. I'm hungry anyway. I'll let you pick who we eat.
 Yeah. It's been a long day.
 Well, you're no picnic, either. I mean, I've only spent one summer with you and I feel like I want to blow my head off.
 I need to go.
 Thought you were resting.
 What did you see?
 Yet you didn't tell Klaus. Why?
 Well, I'm sorry. I can't help you.
 What is this? Why can't I move?
 I won't tell you anything.
 Don't do this. Don't do this.
 Oh. Do tell.
 Oh! So you mean, I'm, uh, I'm taking a page out of the Katherine Pierce playbook.
 You know what's funny? You keep talking to me like I actually trust you enough to tell you anything.
 Okay. I knew them, back in the twenties. They were running from someone. Someone who scared them.
 Don't you want to know why an Original vampire who can't be killed is afraid of a vampire Hunter?
 That's good. It's good to want things, Katherine.
 Katherine. I'm in this alone. If you're looking for a diabolical partner in crime, I suggest you look elsewhere.
 Hmm. Why don't you undagger them?
 But you still care about him. Why?
 You know, when I met you two, you were both on the run.
 Who were you running from?
 Last night I saw you, there was a man looking for you. You both seemed afraid. I just...I wouldn't think Klaus would be afraid of anybody.
 Who was that man?
 No, no, no, I'm sorry.
 Just forget I asked. Okay?
 It's true.
 Your secret...is safe with me.
 One day, maybe.
 What? I'm not...
 She's wrong. Klaus...
 Just give me a chance to explain myself, okay?
 What happened?
 Why did he bring us back to Mystic Falls?
 I'm not hiding anything. I've done everything Klaus has asked me to.
 Where is Klaus now?
 Where is she?
 Klaus.
 I came to ask for your forgiveness. And pledge my loyalty.
 Elena means nothing to me anymore. And whatever you ask of me...I will do.
 Let her go! I'll do whatever you want, you have my word!
 Don't do this, don't do this.
 Don't...Don't...
 Yeah, yeah. Maybe it's just mind control, right? Maybe it just takes some focus, a couple decades of training. No big deal.
 You don't get it. I can't stop, Elena! I'm a ripper! A ripper doesn't stop! I listen to the words that come out of your mouth, and all I hear is the sound of your heart pumping blood through your body. And when that clock ticks down...I'm going to have to feed on you. And you want to know what's worse? I'm not going to be able to stop.
 Why, because I love you?
 You know what, you're right. You're right. I owe you everything. Because through all of this, you are the one thing that has kept me from giving up; from turning it all off. But I can't help what I am, Elena. The more blood that I get, the more I want, and if I get so much as near yours...You are dead.
 Elena, you're going to have run.
 I know what he said, but if you stay, it won't matter. Elena, please, please, please. Elena, there's no other way.
 I can't hold it.
 Elena, run! Go!
 No!
 No!
 No!
 Well, isn't this cozy?
 Last I checked, I live here. Klaus is gone, but he's asked me to keep watch on you until he returns. From now on, you're under my protection.
 Mmm, by all means. Carry on.
 Uh-oh. Alexandra, left hand, please.
 You mean, they owe us a Persian rug? It's my house, too, brother. Ooh! Would you like a spin?
 These ladies are helping me be all that I can be.
 Oh, I'm sorry. Your tone implies that I'm actually supposed to care.
 You're not staying here.
 So I guess she's staying here.
 Hello, Elena.
 What do you mean? I'm going back to school. Go Timberwolves!
 Klaus wants me to keep an eye on you. I'm just doing what I'm told.
 Oh, class is this way.
 Elena, do you think I want to be a senior for the 100th time? No. But if I don't have a choice in the matter, then neither do you.
 You're not gonna want to get in my way. Okay Ric? I will see you both in history.
 You're in my seat.
 Look at you being all fit. Hey, you going to the bonfire tonight? Sounds like fun, right?
 You think I'm annoying now? Wait till homecoming. Hey, who you bringing, by the way? I don't want to be weird.
 Watch it, dick!
 I'm the guy who's been assigned to protect a human blood bag. I mean, no offense or anything.
 What?!
 You all right there?
 You're into Tyler now? That's kind of fickle.
 Elena, hi. What are you doing?
 All right, take it easy. We both know you're kind of a lightweight.
 What's that look?
 My brother's got his flirt on, and you're jealous.
 It's all right. Be jealous by all means. I'm sure Damon will be thrilled.
 All right. That's my mistake.
 You're drunk. You need to go home.
 You're joking, right?
 Well, all right, I'm driving you home. Come on.
 What are you, five? Get down.
 You're hilarious.
 Well you got me tonight. Definitely wasn't expecting that.
 Yeah. You know, you can hate it all you want, but Elena needs me. I'll always protect her. I think you're both better off having me around.
 Elena, wait. You could have let me die in that fire tonight. Why didn't you?
 After everything I've done, you...You still think I'll be able to find my humanity again.
 Elena, do you have any idea how pathetic that makes you?
 What the hell happened to you?
 I didn't do this.
 I didn't.
 It's pretty messed up though, isn't it?
 Hey, guys. Who forgot to invite me to the family summit?
 Hmm? Wow. All these words. I forgot how much I used to care.
 You know, Elena, it's probably best you not torture yourself with memories from the past. It's best we both just move on and accept things as they are.
 You know what, Alaric, you're right. I don't. But Elena's here, and I look out for Elena. Besides, there's going to be people everywhere tonight. So there's going to be lots to eat.
 I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Loosen up.
 Lexi!
 You're dead.
 Then how the hell can I see...
 Look, I don't know how you're here, but you need to leave me alone, okay?
 I don't want your help.
 Well, maybe you should listen this time.
 What is this? Let me out of here!
 Elena. Get rid of her, please.
 This isn't going to work, Lexi. You can't do this.
 What are you doing?
 What are you doing, Lexi?!
 I'm starving! I'm starving! I'm starving! Let me out! Let me out. Please let me out.
 Let me out!
 Did I ever tell you how glad I am that you're dead?
 Elena, Elena. I'm hurting. Please help me.
 I'll do anything. I'll change. I promise.
 Elena, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just make it stop. Please, just make it stop.
 Hey, look at me. Look at me.
 Elena. I love you, okay? I love you. I love you so much. I love you so much, Elena.
 You know what? I don't want your help, anyway. I wish I'd never met you. Every single moment that I've spent with you has been a complete and total waste.
 I will rip you apart, Lexi!
 Not anymore, Lexi.
 You wasted your whole life taking care of me. Now you're dead and you still have nothing better to do.
 Ironic, then, that it's about to be blown to pieces.
 So what are you going to do, Elena? You just going to stand there? Waiting for me to dry out?
 That's good for you. You know, I was wondering when you were going to give up. Lexi gave you...enough of a glimpse into your tragic future.
 You know, if you two are gonna keep me locked in here for the next decade, I think we can skip the routine visits.
 We should all listen to Elena, right? I mean her plans always work out so well, don't they? Why are you here?
 Go away.
 You know, Klaus may wanna keep Elena alive, but that doesn't mean she's safe with Rebekah...
 
 You got me. You're good. Congratulations! You can go now. 
 Actually, this is my happy face...
 What are you doing?
 I'll be at the bar.
 Hopefully something a little bit warmer...and a little bit blonder...
 What's the catch, Damon?
 Oh, the "bunny diet" gave me a lot of time to practice.
 Wallow in despair. 
 Damon, you are worse than Elena. Getting me drunk, brotherly bonding - what do you think, I'll break down and you can pull me back from the edge, is that it?
 Alright! Tell me what's up. What's the point of the jailbreak, hm?
 Come on, Damon. You know Elena is gonna hate you for letting me out. And we both know that you care about what she thinks...
 As long as Klaus is alive, I do what he says.
 Damon, he can't be killed.
 Mikael.
 I can't tell you.
 I can't tell you.
 I'm compelled to do what he says, and he says to keep my damn mouth shut.
 Wait! I can bring him back. I can lure Klaus back to Mystic Falls.
 At least, now we know where Klaus and Elijah learned their tricks from.
 I didn't have a break through, Damon.
 So you know what? You're right, Damon. You're right. You reminded me what my freedom felt like. And when we kill Klaus, I'll be free. Free to leave. See, I didn't do this for you, Damon. I did it for myself.
 Why are you doing this, huh? 
 Aw, better be careful, brother. Your humanity is showing.
 Your father is dead.
 Oh, my mistake. Not your actual father and not dead. Mikael. Daggered. What do you want me to do with the body?
 Aye, let's say that Mikael followed Elena in here. He tried to grab her, so he could use her as bait.
 Okay, fine. We vervained him, and in the process discovered that he had a dagger.
 We drove it through his heart.
 Well, don't look at me. I am just in charge of getting him back here.
 With what? Those daggers won't work on him.
 Where is it?
 Against what?
 Well, he is here. Come by whenever.
 It's true. I saw it with my own eyes.
 That's not a problem. She is right here.
 I need to borrow a tie.
 Hm...I'm a 162 years old and I'm going to a Homecoming Dance. I need better ties.
 I'm compelled to protect you. And if I look at your track record at high school dances - it's pretty tragic. With my luck you'll go and get yourself murdered by the Homecoming Queen...
 Ah, please tell me that you have a better plan than wolfsbane grenades?
 My freedom from Klaus rests entirely upon you two executing your plan perfectly. So, excuse me if I'm a bit cynical.
 You do have reason to worry, but if I look back in our history of epic plan failures, it's usually because one of us let our humanity get in the way. Upon taking odds on how this thing goes down, it's certainly not gonna be me who screws it up. I'll see you at Homecoming. I can't wait.
 Hey Tyler. Nice party you've got going on.
 What do you mean?
 Quite the Homecoming.
 So, what now? Stop running?
 Your family. You mean the people you cart around in caskets?
 I have no idea. I thought she was coming with Matt.
 I said I have no idea. How would you like me to take you to your father?
 All right. Perhaps there's something in it for me...? My freedom from your compulsion?
 Change of plans. Klaus is back. He is at the Lockwood's and he wants your body delivered to his doorstep.
 Well, he's certainly not gonna come here. I hope your plan didn't depend on that?
 But you do have a plan, right?
 He doesn't need to know.
 Elena.
 How did you know that I would stop Damon?
 So pull the plug on the plan.
 What's that?
 You wanted Klaus dead for five hundred years. Why would you risk all that, just to safe Damon's life?
 Nah. Come on, Katherine. You don't care about anybody but yourself. You never have.
 I can't let it all back in. I don't want to. Not after everything I've done.
 What's that?
 I'm just calling to thank you for my freedom.
 Thing is, it came at too high of a price. You took everything from me, Klaus.
 You know what never get's old? Revenge.
 What's the matter, Klaus? Missing something?
 Just enjoying my freedom.
 You do that, and you will never see your family again. I wonder Klaus, as someone who has been one step ahead for a thousand years...are you prepared for this?
 Hello Bonnie.
 Yeah. Wasn't too hard. You should probably be more careful.
 Relax. I just need your help.
 Let me fill you in on a little secret about Klaus. He kept his family with him at all times...daggered. Stored in coffins. And now I have them, and I need you to help keep them hidden.
 His family is his one weakness. As long as I have that, I can ruin him.
 You're a witch. You hate Klaus. I know you can figure something out.
 Go away! You shouldn't be here Elena.
 Well, Bonnie sucks at keeping secrets.
 Oh, really? Is that what I need to do?
 Elena, stop talking. I'm not giving Klaus anything.
 Not really my problem.
 Wow! That was impressive. But the coffins aren't here, so...You can go away now.
 Okay, lets talk.
 Piece by piece Klaus took everything from me. I'm doing the same to him.
 I did it to save you!
 He was one step ahead of us. If Klaus died, his hybrids would have killed you.
 You have somewhere you need to be Damon?
 We're done. Can't you just go away?
 I don't owe you anything.
 Because Klaus's family is one weakness I can use against him.
 You're wrong Damon. Klaus isn't just get to just live forever. There's another way. There has to be.
 I don't need your help.
 I'm in this alone Damon.
 You want in?
 Okay. But it's just me and you. Elena stays out of it.
 Follow me.
 Don't you worry Damon. We all want the same thing.
 Have a look.
 Hm...Look again.
 Witch spirits hate Klaus as much as we do. They're using their powers to hide the coffins.
 ...he won't be able to find them.
 Don't bother. It won't open.
 Nope. Just won't open. I've tried everything. Blow torch, axe, crowbar. Can't even scratch the finish.
 Meaning whatever is in there, should probably stay in there.
 You're late. We were supposed to meet Bonnie at the witch house in ten minutes.
 Would you hurry up? We have work to do. You know, Klaus isn't gonna spontaneously self-destruct. Why are you all chipper?
 You didn't say anything to Elena about the coffins, right?
 I know what you said.
 Because protecting the location of Klaus's family is my number one priority right now. And the fewer people who know, the better.
 What?
 You're wasting your time. It won't open. Did you bury the body?
 Nope, just the dead one.
 No idea. But whatever is in here, Bonnie seems to think will help us kill Klaus. So, the sooner she can get this open, the sooner we will know if she's right.
 You know, none of this is gonna do us any good if Klaus's hybrid friends find our hiding place, right? They need to go away.
 Well, I'm not gonna play defense when I have what Klaus wants. He does what I say, or I dump his family to the bottom of the ocean.
 No, he's bluffing. His family means more to him than anything else.
 Well I don't know Damon. I mean, I guess there's only one way to find out, right? Call his bluff.
 I live here, Klaus.
 You know, I don't like your hybrid friends. They're everywhere, kind of like fleas. I want them gone.
 Friends don't strip friends of their free will.
 Klaus, get your hybrids out of Mystic Falls or I will remove them myself.
 Do whatever you want, I don't really care. Or you know what? Maybe I do. Maybe I care so much, that I'll drop Elijah in the Arctic.
 Try me, let's find out.
 Well, one down. You may want to, ah, send the rest of them away before it gets messy, again.
 What are you doing?
 No, I told Klaus to get his hybrids out of town, he didn't listen, so I'm gonna say it louder.
 Protecting Elena is your problem now. See, I'm not compelled by Klaus to do that anymore.
 To beat the villain, Damon, you have to be the better villain.
 Hello Damon, she's a little busy right now.
 I'm making my next move. Let me ask you something...What will Klaus do if he can't make anymore hybrids?
 I took Klaus's family to make him suffer. I'm not gonna let him make himself a new one.
 Maybe. Maybe, I'll just turn you into a vampire.
 Tell your hybrids to get out of town, Klaus.
 Okay, well then I'm gonna drive your blood source off Wickery Bridge.
 I just fed her my blood. No more hybrids if she's a vampire.
 Really? Try me, because your coffins are next to go. Say goodbye to your family Klaus.
 Get back in the car.
 Elena, get in the car.
 Look, he had to believe that I would do it, all right? Your fear sold it.
 He did.
 
 Destroying Klaus is all I've left.
 I lost you the minute I left town with him. You just haven't let yourself admit that yet.
 I don't really care what you think about me any more, Elena.
 What the hell are you doing?
 And I needed you to keep her out of it, Bonnie.
 Don't tempt me, Elena.
 Find who? What are you talking about?
 Who is this?
 What are you doing here, Klaus?
 What do you want?
 Well, see...Klaus...I'm not negotiating.
 No, No. You leave Mystic Falls and then give me call in a few years and we'll talk.
 Or what? You make one move and I will drop...
 Where are you?
 You're kidding me, right?
 Klaus is getting antsy. He knows that I'm stalling. We need to move faster.
 Sure, Elena. Whatever you say.
 Hi, Elena. Nice lake house.
 So, what did you think, I wouldn't find out?
 This is exactly why I didn't want you in the loop, Elena.
 Damn it!
 I'd listen to her. Get back upstairs, man.
 Go back upstairs, before I tear your damn throat out. Do you understand me?
 It's the way it has to be, Elena.
 Elena, he's compelled.
 Every time I move, the wood shifts inside of me. I can feel it scraping against my heart. You need to get the pieces out.
 Just get it out, Elena, please. Just get it out.
 You've changed. Something is different about you. You're stronger. Tougher.
 It's good though.
 I shouldn't have kidnapped you. The car, the bridge, that was too far.
 But you shouldn't have lied to me today. You can't go off and do things like that, Elena. Not while Klaus is still alive.
 Without me getting in the way.
 You're better than him, Elena. You're better than both of us.
 Oh, you're still alive. I assume, that means Klaus didn't get his coffins.
 Probably a good choice.
 Nah, doesn't surprise me. Its been that kind of night.
 What did you do?
 Keep up, we don't have much time.
 It was a choice Bonnie, you made it and now we have to live with it. You told Klaus where the coffins were and he took them. All of them except this one.
 Yep. Fortunately it seems to be the one he cares about most.
 Vampires can't get in. Damon had to compel a couple of Lockwood gardeners to bring the coffin in.
 Look, if you're really the key to opening up that coffin, I think it's a pretty save bet you're on Klaus's hit list. So I suggest you hideout here and figure out a way to open up the damn thing.
 And I don't believe you. But time's ticking. Won't be long before Klaus calls his hybrids to find that coffin and kill all of us. So dig deep, Abby Bennett. Scrape out whatever magic you have left.
 What are you doing here?
 Well, there's nothing to talk about. I'm just focused on getting this coffin open.
 Why would you think I did that?
 Well, believe what you want, Elena.
 But you had to ask me anyway.
 Did you ask Damon...if he killed anybody lately?
 Yeah, sorry, not interested.
 Klaus won't make a deal, Damon.
 So, that's your, uh, plan? Stall Klaus?
 So you unleashed an Original to help him out?
 There's nothing smart about trusting Elijah, Damon. He screwed us over the last time he promised to help us kill Klaus.
 Hm. Well I guess that goes both ways, doesn't it?
 I didn't come here to eat, Klaus. Fact, I didn't want to come here at all. But I was told I had to cause you would hear us out.
 Kind of like you and Rebekah, right? Where is she, by the way? Last I checked she was still daggered because you were afraid to face her.
 We're here to make a deal, Damon. Doesn't mean we need to kiss his ass for seven courses.
 I don't know. Ask Damon.
 One more word about Elena and this dinner's over.
 Wait a minute. So you both loved the same girl?
 Well, I guess the only reason you agreed to this evening, Klaus, is to drive a wedge between me and my brother.
 And continue the Petrova bloodline. Every few hundred years, you'll have a new doppelgÃ¤nger to drain and never run out of hybrids, right Klaus?
 Nice try, Klaus. But no deal.
 Go ahead and kill me. I know you'll do it when he brings the coffin.
 Ah, you were right about Elijah. Undaggering him was a smart move.
 So, I guess I shouldn't thank you for saving me from Klaus?
 You could have left me there. Klaus would have killed me and you would have had Elena all to yourself.
 I love her, Damon.
 Something's gotta make this night worthwhile.
 Bonnie? She's still breathing.
 Coffin's open.
 As in the Original Witch?
 She was supposed to be the weapon to help us kill Klaus.
 That coffin was the only thing stopping Klaus from tearing us to shreds.
 Who the hell are the Mikaelsons?
 No, Elena is right. Bonnie was led to open that coffin for a reason. I think there is more to this than just some family reunion.
 What for? It's your job now.
 Okay fine, then I'll go.
 I could ask you the same thing.
 Oh, yeah.
 Well Mayor Lockwood dragged me out here. Couldn't exactly say no.
 Took you about thirty seconds to put Damon in a mood.
 I think he needs to figure out that you can look out for yourself.
 Okay, so talk.
 Why are you telling me this?
 No, you're not wrong. What do you need me to do?
 You sure you can do this?
 Well, better hurry up. He won't be down for long.
 Easy, buddy. Don't want you doing anything stupid.
 Exactly where she belongs, talking with Esther.
 Ah, don't blame me. This was all her, right down to the broken neck.
 You know, maybe you should stop being such a controlling dick, Damon.
 You're a liability, brother.
 Yeah, well, your emotions are getting in the way of our plan.
 Maybe because you care too damn much.
 Damon! Are you crazy?
 So uh, Esther wants to kill her whole family. How is that for Mother of the Year?
 Well, good. I can't say I'll be sorry to see any of them go.
 No, you signed Klaus's death sentence, Elena. Everyone else is just collateral damage.
 Their family has brought you nothing but darkness, Elena. It is that simple. So, uh...where's Damon? I would think that he'd wanna make sure you got home safely.
 What was with him going after Kol?
 So did I. Anyway, uh, good night.
 When?
 Elena, stop.
 What? You think I want to be this person? I hurt you, Elena. I bit you. I hate myself for what I did to you.
 I can't.
 If I let myself care, all I feel is pain.
 He's right, you know. Klaus has to die. They all do.
 Should wait until Klaus is dead.
 You still think she's gonna screw this up, don't you?
 Is it because of your little sleepover?
 Well, given who you chose to sleep with, I would say it's one hundred percent your fault.
 Nah. She's better off without me. Sure as hell better off without you.
 I can't find her anywhere.
 So, what are we supposed to do?
 Broken?
 You want us to kill them.
 We need to call Bonnie. There's got to be a way for her to stop Esther from channeling all that power.
 You got a better plan?
 Kill them.
 There's got to be another way.
 You want to dagger Elijah!
 We don't know if that'll effect Klaus.
 Dagger is lethal to any vampire who uses it.
 We don't. But if they're not, then we have about ten minutes until Rebekah tears Elena apart.
 Elena.
 She'd let herself be killed to save her friend.
 Hm. If we do this, it'll wreck her.
 Hm. So, who's it gonna be, brother?
 Awful lot of effort for someone who pretends not to care about her any more.
 They took Elena. They're going to kill her unless we stop Esther.
 Bonnie, if you can't stop her. I have to find another way.
 Esther's drawing from the witches. The only way to cut her off is if one of you is no longer a witch.
 Elijah kept his word. Rebekah let her go.
 I lost that coin toss, Damon. It should have been me who turned Abby. Why did you do it?
 Hmm. That part of me is gone for good.
 How'd you know?
 Since the night I threatened to drive Elena off the Wickery Bridge.
 You know, you're not fooling anyone either. You still love her, Damon.
 What do you want?
 What are you doing?
 Vaguely. Why?
 Your point being?
 1912.
 "It feels strange to be home again after so long away. I thought I would never return. Certainly not for a funeral."
 His nephew, actually. Miss..?
 As in Johnathan Gilbert.
 Crossed paths. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be inappropriate, but no one seems to be willing to discuss the details of Zachariah's death.
 Damon.
 It's been almost fifty years. I'm surprised you came.
 I see you're still mad at me.
 Any chance you took it all out on our nephew Zachariah?
 I'm not like that anymore, Damon.
 Damon, wait.
 Lets grab a drink, catch up.
 I've missed you brother.
 Ahhh, I get it, I get it. You're bored! Your best friend's in jail and you don't have anything better to do with yourself.
 They were all on the Founders' Council, Damon. That's what they all have in common.
 I'm not jonesing.
 Yeah, yeah, maybe it was a vampire, Damon.
 Well, there was one other vampire. Remember Sage?
 Damon, you've had enough.
 I can teach you how to survive without human blood, you know.
 Town questioned every grown man in Mystic Falls. Probably never occurred to them that a woman could have done it.
 You just, uh, don't give up, do you?
 I'm not being self-righteous, Damon. I'm just not interested in slaughtering innocent human beings anymore.
 Well, this is fun.
 Alright, you know what, I need to, uh, I gotta get out of here.
 Damon, I'm not...
 Okay, fine, I'm freaking out. I'm ready to eat the entire wait staff, why do you need to hear me say it?
 Damon, stop!
 What are you doing?
 No. No.
 Why are you doing this? You know what blood does to me.
 Elena.
 Doesn't really matter what Elena thinks.
 Why do you even care, huh? The whole brother bonding thing, getting Elena to hate you, what do you feel guilty because you kissed her, is that it Damon? Because you can stop, go back to hating me. It was a lot easier.
 I don't need your help.
 What are you talking about?
 They're people, Damon.
 I don't do that anymore.
 Oh my God...Oh my God, I'm sorry.
 I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
 What did you do to me?!
 What did you do to me?
 I don't need your help.
 You couldn't have.
 Why?
 So I dug into the old family archives from the 1900s.
 Want me to go back to being mad at you?
 Well, nothing from 1912, they never did arrest anyone for the Founders' murders. 
 Johnathan Gilbert's granddaughter, Samantha. They assumed she was crazy. Locked her up in an insane asylum.
 Trail ends there. I mean, she was a Founder, you know how they like to look out for their own.
 Why?
 So you think Samantha Gilbert is still alive, running around Mystic Falls, killing Founders?
 Then she must have had a ring that brought her back to life, I mean she was a Gilbert, right? Those rings were passed on for generations.
 Johnathan Gilbert only made two of those rings. Jeremy has one of them and the other's....
 Hey.
 I just got home.
 That's fine.
 Yeah, I'm â€“ I'm okay. Did you get everything you need?
 You don't have to read that, you know.
 I can just tell you what happened. Samantha Gilbert was committed to an insane asylum, she tried to give herself a lobotomy with a knitting needle, and bled to death on the floor of her cell. If the same thing is happening to Alaric then there is nothing you can do.
 What did you say to Elena this morning?
 I asked you a question, Damon.
 Do me a favor, Damon. Next time you talk to Elena, keep me out of it, okay?
 Missed you at the house. Alaric told me you'd be here.
 I'm not trying to hurt you, Elena. I just can't be who you want me to be right now. I'm not in control.
 I uh- I did a little more digging on Samantha Gilbert. 
 She was under suicide watch. No personal effects, no jewelry.
 What if Bonnie's spell doesn't work? What are you gonna do with him?
 You don't know how long this has been going on. Might be too late.
 You can't put that on yourself. Not everyone is your responsibility. Not everyone can be saved.
 Pictures of his victims.
 It's the Founders Council roster. Looks like some sort of hit list.
 Who else would have written it, Elena?
 I'm trying not to.
 Elena, I need you to come upstairs with me.
 I'm gonna need your help.
 Just having a little toast.
 Control.
 Why are you in such a good mood? Sage double-crossed you, tree's a pile of ash, Alaric's got a psychopathic alter ego.
 They think all the wood burned.
 We have a weapon.
 This needs to have a sharper point.
 We finally have our own stakes to kill an Original. I'm not gonna miss because you can't whittle.
 Look, you're not turning yourself in. Bonnie's herbs are working and we have Originals to kill.
 Klaus needs to die. We finally have the chance to kill him, so you are not turning yourself in.
 Where's Bonnie?
 I texted her too.
 Nope. We all have a weapon.
 Klaus has always been one step ahead of us, but now we have the advantage. We're all armed and they are all linked, meaning we only need to kill one of them. We need to seize the best opportunity, which means we need to prepare for every opportunity.
 Rebekah is our target so we distract her and catch her off guard. To do that we need to keep Klaus separate and occupied. 
 Gives me time for one shot.
 Got it? Good. So we all have one stake, we keep it hidden and we look out for any opportunity we have.
 We have 12 stakes, 12 shots at killing one Original. We can do this. Alright, let's try another scenario. Elena grab a crossbow. 
 Hey.
 I just got home. Why?
 Ex-girlfriend? Guy's been in a coffin for the last 900 years. 
 Listen to me, Elena, do not do anything, okay? Sage is very old and very strong. You don't stand a chance against her.
 What the hell happened to you?
 I think we have a problem.
 Hey. He's just banged up. Caroline's gonna stay with him and make sure Alaric stays Alaric. Matt texted me and said Finn is still in the Grill. We need to plan our next move.
 No, we need to stay on point. See an Original, kill an Original. That's the plan.
 Look, Elena, I understand that you're concerned about my brother's life, but if he even knew, for one second, that we were talking about missing a chance to kill these people he would lose his mind.
 I know what my brother would want.
 You gonna help me with this or not?
 Okay, I'll figure it out myself.
 Nothing worked until I see Klaus's dead body myself.
 Stay with Caroline. I'll call you when it's over.
 What we need is for Klaus to be dead.
 Anger gets things done, Elena!
 Klaus does not get to survive this. Not after everything he took from me.
 I had to kill him, Sage.
 It's the blood. The bloodline. It has to be. Think about it  Finn turned Sage, Sage turned Troy. They're all part of the same vampire bloodline that originated with Finn.
 
 I'm here to make a deal.
 Eight stakes made of white oak. The part of Wickery Bridge that you forgot to burn.
 Actually it's not. Finn is dead.
 Damon in exchanged for the last eight weapons that can kill you.
 Because there aren't.
 I'll get you the other three.
 What is wrong with you?
 Hey.
 I'll be a ball of sunshine once Damon gets Alaric's stake back. Promise.
 Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.
 Cause he's not worth it. All this time and energy that I've wasted hating him, it was for nothing. It's done, it's over. We lost. I'm right back where I started.
 And what did I lose in the process?
 Look, hating Klaus was easy. It allowed me to ignore everything that was happening around me. Everything I let slip away. Now I have to deal with that.
 No, no, just admit it. Admit it to me, Elena. I know you don't owe it to me, but I just need to hear you say it.
 I know that. I know you didn't. Even though I did everything possible to push you away. It's my fault. It's all my fault. I mean, this is all my fault.
 I'm talking about the fact that you're also in love with Damon.
 Hey. I love you. I will always love you. I just want you to look me in the eye and tell me that you don't feel something for him.
 Not yet. I'm sure I will soon though. 
 I'll get it out of Alaric. I just need some time.
 You don't think I can do what it takes.
 Be safe.
 Well, look, I know it's not easy so 
 Oh, I am one step ahead of you.
 Yeah, I needed to stay here.
 Well, unfortunately, we only have a limited amount of time.
 Before we have to resort to other methods.
 Look, Elena needed to go on that road trip with Damon. No matter what I go through to get her back; fighting my bloodlust, trying to gain control of my life again...None of that matters if she has feelings for somebody else.
 They should. Haven't heard from them. Elena's worried about him, knowing that she can't count on his ring anymore.
 Yeah, maybe.
 That actually makes perfect sense. Your wife left you to become a vampire and your girlfriend was killed by one.
 Ah, he's too judgmental.
 No. No, he's not you. He's the darkest parts of you. The parts we all have.
 Yeah, well it's gonna take a little more time.
 Well, then you won't know the location of the other stake.
 Well, I can't. When we staked Finn, we discovered that killing an Original vampire killed its entire bloodline. Now, I don't know which one of you I'm descended from, but I'd really rather not find out by dying, so why don't we just find the stake, destroy it, so we can all be safe?
 Nope, only dead Alaric.
 Don't worry, he was wearing his ring. Klaus was here, let's just say he's not very patient.
 A few hours. I'm hoping when he wakes up, it won't be him, it'll be the other him.
 Yeah, I know. Whatever it takes. So, were you able to contact Rose?
 A motel?
 Welcome back.
 No, you pretty much laid there dead for half the night. But on the uh- on the plus side, I did almost finish reading Moby Dick.
 I know.
 I don't want to do any of this.
 Wait, wait, what are you doing? You need that ring.
 Look, Alaric, I'm not gonna kill you, okay?
 If I put any more into it, I'm gonna break your spine.
 No, no, no, no, no, I can't...the blood.
 No, I'm not.
 Not like this, Alaric.
 If I go this far, I may not be able to stop.
 You.
 Where's the stake?
 Tell me where the stake is before I kill you.
 Where's the stake?!
 I'm gonna kill you in three...two...one.
 So, what are you gonna do now, Klaus? You gonna kill me?
 Aww, sure you have. See you've had every chance and every excuse imaginable to do it, but yet you haven't. Which means you don't want to.
 I've been fighting that part of myself, thinking that if I repressed it then it would go away. But it won't. And now that I've accepted it, it can't control me. And neither can you. So, unless you're gonna stake me, why don't you get the hell out of my house?
 Hey...
 Yeah, everything alright?
 Um, I'd love that.
 Damon, I...
 You look um- very beautiful. Here, I got something for you.
 So, given our dangeous dance karma, sure you're up for this?
 Hmm. Who gave you that horrible advice?
 Right.
 Please.
 Oh no, no, no, no. I blacked out for most of this decade, remember?
 Bonnie seems happy.
 I've been meaning to talk to her. Apologize.
 I don't need to know, Elena. When all this is over, if you and I find our way back to each other, you can tell me if you want to. Otherwise I don't need to know. I don't want to know.
 Because after everything I've put you through, I'm just honored to be your date tonight.
 Why don't we get him off vervain, compel him?
 What you think he'd go after Elena?
 Salt. It's the binding agent for her spell.
 Your mother is back.
 It's suicide, Jeremy.
 Ah, don't be stupid, Klaus. Bonnie doesn't give a damn about us. The only reason she's helping us right now is to save Caroline and Tyler. You start killing the people she cares about, she'll tell us all to go to hell.
 They're at the old cemetery. Jeremy and Matt are headed there right now.
 I didn't have a choice, Caroline. We're useless right now stuck in here.
 Yeah, well I'm just as worried about what Esther is up to. She lead Klaus here for a reason. If she succeeds in whatever she's doing -
 No one is gonna die, okay? Bonnie is still looking for a way around the boundary spell. It's not too late.
 Oh, I'm done with revenge. As far as Esther; we've stopped her before, we'll stop her again.
 You say that like I'm supposed to have happy memories about it.
 Thank you, Bonnie. For everything.
 We can handle this later you know.
 Elena. Hey, Elena, please.
 I want you to come with me.
 Hey, please.
 We were in this gym the night Klaus compelled me to turn my feelings off. I thought I hit rock bottom in the Twenties, but after I bit you I never wanted to feel anything again. But someone...kept telling me that it was okay to feel. No matter how much it hurt. That our emotions are what make us human, good or bad, and to never lose hope.
 Just some girl I used to date.
 You have me.
 Going darker, huh?
 I don't suppose anyone tried to talk you guys out of doing this so soon.
 Want a hand?
 I â€“ I was just checking up on you guys. Seeing how you were doing, after everything.
 Yeah, yeah he did.
 I'll get that.
 What do you mean he turned? I thought you were standing guard!
 So, where's the stake now?
 Alright, so how do we kill him now?
 What are you doing here, Klaus?
 Why don't you go up to your room?
 Elena!
 Where is she?
 She's not here.
 Elena's car is gone.
 Get down!
 Alaric.
 Put it out.
 Elena's not here. Alaric has her and Caroline and he's gonna kill them both unless you turn yourself over to him.
 I really wish we could. But unfortunately, if Alaric kills you there's a one in four chance that we die too.
 And a hundred percent chance that Tyler dies.
 Why don't we just figure out a way to put Alaric down?
 This isn't really helping too much.
 Abby just showed up.
 I'll go with you.
 There's no catch. I'd turn my back on everything here to make sure Elena's safe.
 You know, all this time and energy you've spent trying to get me and my brother to hate each other. It's actually had the opposite effect.
 Ah, go for it. Damon and I have been through a hell of a lot worse than you.
 If one of us gets a clean shot, take it, the other two  hold him down.
 Let's just get this over with, shall we?
 What are you talking about?
 Klaus needs Elena's blood to make hybrids. She's the last person that he'd kill.
 We should get her home before the sun sets.
 You lost a lot of blood today.
 Nah, he won't be able to find us.
 I'll uh â€“ I'll call you when we get back.
 It's um â€“ it's been a long day.
 What?
 You're in a good mood.
 We won.
 We. Won.
 Nah, you know what, thank you. Turns out we make a pretty good team, huh?
 What happens when uh- Elena makes a decision?
 What if she doesn't?
 Well, if she chooses you, I'll leave town and let you two be happy and not be bothered by me.
 Yeah.
 She's a pretty special girl.
 Every remaining Original is gonna want Elena dead to stop Alaric. She's a sitting duck in there.
 You know one of us needs to keep moving, right? If Klaus really is the sire of our bloodline, we need to keep his body hidden before Alaric finds him, kills him, and we all end up dead.
 Hey.
 You're on house arrest. You're supposed to be coddled.
 Letting her make her own decisions.
 Nothing wrong with free will, Matt. Trust me, you don't realize that till you lose it.
 Elijah.
 And you'll just run?
 Elena, it's up to you.
 Jeremy will be fine. Between all of us, we'll have the strength in numbers to disarm Alaric.
 Hey, what's wrong?
 Well, I promise I will do everything in my power to make sure that we all come back.
 That's just in case there is no later.
 I've got Caroline and Elijah in place. Jeremy is gonna lead Alaric to us.
 What would you have done, Damon?
 You know she'd just hate you for it, right?
 As soon as we get the stake, hand over the coffin and get out. Alaric's got half the police looking for Klaus' car.
 Damon.
 I feel okay, do you feel anything?
 It took Sage about an hour before she got sick.
 Well, if he wasn't lying, an hour is not enough time to get you all the way back to Mystic Falls.
 Not us, brother. You and Elena.
 It's gonna be fine. Klaus was lying, we're all gonna be okay.
 Hello?
 Rebekah.
 Yeah, he told me that. He also said you two would be long gone out of town by now.
 What are you talking about? We had a deal.
 Rebekah, no.
 Hey. I'm right here. You've been in and out for hours.
 You were in an accident.
 He's fine.
 When Jeremy brought you to the hospital before all this happened, your injuries were worse than anyone knew. Meredith Fell made a choice, she used Damon's blood to heal you.
 Maybe it doesn't have to. I talked to Bonnie, she says she's stronger than ever, there might be something that she can do to help you.
 We have all day before she has to feed, Damon. That's a day to exhaust every possible way out of this.
 We will. We'll try everything.
 You know what, you weren't there the day Elena looked me in the eye and told me she absolutely never wanted this.
 I never meant for her to die. She asked me to help Matt first and I did.
 I made a choice that I will regret for the rest of my life. Now let me try to fix it.
 It's disgusting.
 It's disgusting.
 I should have saved you first. You shouldn't be going through this right now.
 And what am I supposed to do if Bonnie can't figure out a way to help you, huh? Because then you have another choice to make. Either let yourself die or be a vampire.
 You're laughing. I'm pretty sure you don't actually think that's funny.
 Your emotions are a bit heightened today. A lot heightened.
 Hey. Shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay.
 Listen to me. No matter what happens, I'm here for you. I can help you.
 Why don't you go back upstairs where it's dark? I'll clean up.
 Elena, don't move.
 Elena, I'm right here. Are you okay?
 Just ignore her.
 What happened?
 Hey! Anyone, hey!
 You think we're afraid of you?
 Listen to me. Elena's gonna die if you don't let her out of here.
 She's innocent. Let her out.
 
 I said, let her out!
 Elena? You still with me?
 No, you're not. I can hear you breathing. Damon was right, you should have fed this morning. I'm so sorry.
 I love you so much.
 I'm smiling.
 Elena. Elena!
 What the hell is your problem?
 What, you think you were my first choice?
 No, no, no, you don't have to live with that; you get to live with that. Because Elena put your life before her own. So every morning you get out of bed, you sure as hell better earn it.
 Yeah, I'm sure Damon has a revenge plan cooked up. 
 I know. Wish I could though. Wish I could just tell you that you'll never feel pain, that you'll never crave blood. But you will. It'll be the worst thing that you've ever lived through.
 Bonnie made this for you yesterday.
 Just in case.
 One day at a time, right?
 Hi.
 No, I'm not. If I can get Elena used to animal blood right out the gate.
 Maybe she'll be able to bypass all the things that we went through.
 Maybe she actually has a shot at this.
 She won't be able to handle it if she hurts someone, Damon. Her compassion is her Achilles heel and everything is magnified right now.
 Close your eyes.
 Oh, come on, you know what happens. You name me a vampire who didn't kill at least one person when they were new.
 If she kills someone, she will crumble. How much pain do you think she could take before she shuts off her humanity switch?
 No, I think I'd like her to skip that part.
 What are you doing? Knock it off.
 I said stop it!
 Don't worry, he'll heal. Bigger animals are more resilient.
 Hey. 
 We're just having a little disagreement about process.
 Ready to go?
 Alright, it's like the starting line of a race, right? So you just push off with every ounce of strength that you have.
 Just concentrate, okay? You can do it.
 Oh, okay.
 Yeah. What does it feel like?
 Everything is heightened. Taste, smell, sight, touch.
 Hi.
 This is from the year you were born. I think we should celebrate.
 Your first feed. I know it was disgusting and traumatic and it was horrible, but you did it anyway.
 You survived it.
 Listen, I choked it down for a month before I could stomach the taste. It gets easier. 
 Yeah, because you're here and you're alive â€“ ish. And you're gonna get through this.
 So, would you like to do the honors?
 Cheers.
 Perfect timing, Damon. Yeah, we just got back. What?
 These were specially carved; the length, the width. If you were a normal vampire, you'd be dead.
 
 I don't know. They're something.
 Bonnie? Bonnie, I know you're in there. I can hear you breathing. Bonnie, please, it's important.
 Hey. You alright?
 Can I come in, please?
 Well, you're dealing with the Other Side. It's not reliable. Witches were probably just messing with your head trying to teach you a lesson.
 Yeah, but, it can wait.
 Alright, these burn to the touch. Could just be steeped in vervain, but this writing, have you ever seen anything like this before?
 I think we have a new vampire hunter in town.
 What's in the bag, Damon?
 Are you really that intent on having your way?
 If she hurts someone, she'll be desperate to turn the guilt off. Maybe even desperate enough to shut off her humanity.
 I can't let her be anything like me.
 She's strong. If we help her, she can survive this.
 What are you talking about? She told me she was fine.
 She drank from you?
 What are you doing here, Tyler?
 With a hunter out to get you?
 Maybe you should have told me she was rejecting all food sources.
 Oh, bite me.
 It's okay, it's okay. I got you, I got you.
 It's alright; just remember what we talked about. Focus, push back, come on you can do this.
 She's hungry. She hasn't fed.
 I can't. There's somebody watching us.
 You do that, Damon, and you risk exposing all of us.
 Don't do it, Damon. Please.
 Elena, we can't risk it.
 Damon's way ahead of you. Stay here, I have to help him.
 Damon?
 You know what.
 It helps with the cravings.
 Yeah, I'm mad. You lied to me.
 Come on, Elena, you lied to me.
 You think I'm happy?
 You're in hell which means that I'm in hell. Then you go to Damon for help.
 You think I don't?
 You fed on him, Elena. You fed on him. I know that may not mean much to you, but it means a lot to me. And I know it certainly meant a lot to Damon.
 Your emotions are a bit heightened right now.
 Hey, come on. Come with me.
 There's something we need to do. Come on.
 We're finishing the memorial we didn't get to have earlier.
 We need to start healing, Damon. We've all lost so much, especially recently. I think we're numb to it. We push it away, we make a joke out of it, ignore how we feel. We've never just let ourselves grieve.
 Yeah. Yeah, we need to do this.
 Not tonight, we don't.
 This is for my uncle Zach and my friend Lexi and for Alaric.
 
 
 
 That was before she turned.
 
 It's the first time we've been back in Alaric's classroom...
 Why are you still in town, Rebekah? Don't you have anywhere else to go?
 Just breathe, just breathe. You haven't felt this kind of rage before.
 What the hell is he doing here?
 No, no, no. Hey, hey, let me get this. 
 How about we just leave the murdering to Damon?
 
 Yeah, she's channeling all her emotions into rage. It makes her feel like she has purpose. I used to do that too when I was...you know.
 Yeah. She needs to come to terms with it, confront it, let it in, before she can let it go.
 Hm.
 Wow, we didn't have to be invited in. I wonder who used to live here.
 You're fixating.
 This is mine now.
 Thank you.
 Why don't you have a drink? It'll help you let go.
 And I am going to find something a little stronger than beer.
 Damon give that to you?
 
 
 
 Come on Klaus, where the hell are you?
 Hey.
 
 She has werewolf venom in her system. You know you're the only one that can heal her, Klaus. Please.
 Whatever you want from me...
 Hey. Thanks for coming.
 
 You grew into yourself when you became a vampire. You changed. And Elena, she's changing too, and I want her to be able to enjoy it, without all the guilt and shame that I went through. And there was a moment today when she did. And when I'm with her, every bone in my body tells me to join her. To enjoy it. But, I know that if I do, even a little, I risk becoming him...the Ripper. I love her, and I don't want to hold her back.
 Damon promised he'd help me stay off the edge, but he and I...we're not in a very good place right now. Not when it comes to her. I just thought, you're so good at it, at being a vampire.
 So what is all this?
 And you know for a fact that he was supernatural?
 What's The Five?
 What? You're not gonna tell me?
 You're in a fight. I'm not in a fight, I'm over it, I've been over it.
 You let her feed on you. I'm always gonna be mad at you but we're not in a fight.
 So Connor's still out there.
 
 A little slow. I almost got you.
 What about Caroline? She's a genius at self-control.
 So I guess that leaves Damon, huh?
 Fine, you wish it could be me.
 Okay.
 Just be careful, okay? The blood, the feed...It's easy to get caught up in it.
 I was gonna take him, but I figured you went through such trouble to truss him up in your red room of pain.
 What'd you get out of him?
 Well, I can't say it in front of him. As I'm sure you've figured out, our friend here can't be compelled.
 Damon said you knew something about this guy. Now, I should have figured out that you were up to something when you healed Elena from the werewolf poison without asking for anything in return.
 You're never benevolent. Who is this guy? What's the Five?
 It's a good thing I have nothing to do today, except get answers out of you.
 So these hunters have been around for nine hundred years?
 And Rebekah had a thing with one of them?
 And what's that?
 And what's in it for me?
 You won't remember any of this.
 Klaus wants me to fake peace with you, so you'll talk about the Five.
 Alright, well, forget him. Help me instead.
 Because I want to figure out what he's up to and plus I can give you the one thing he won't.
 A clean slate. I'm not saying that I'm willing to forgive you for what you did to Elena, but I'm willing to set it aside and start over.
 Because, you're obviously not leaving town anytime soon and I'm just looking for a way we can all get along. Plus you can't be too happy wandering around school with no friends.
 Well, I'm pretty sure that you care what Matt, over there, thinks. So, maybe I can talk to him about a clean slate too.
 Let me just name the million other people I'd rather be having dinner with right now.
 Okay, good. Now, why don't you tell me about Rebekah's hunter?
 So, that's what this is about? A weapon.
 How is a weapon the answer to all my prayers?
 Okay. Why don't we just skip with the theatrics and get right to the point?
 What puzzle?
 The tattoo. What is it?
 So, tell me more about this tattoo.
 I thought the daggers didn't work on you because of your werewolf side.
 There is no cure for vampirism.
 Then why wouldn't you have searched for it, found it?
 Well, I hope you got what you wanted out of her before you chased her off.
 What do you need me to find out?
 The sword.
 No one deserves to be treated that way.
 A part of me wishes that she and I could have an eternity together. But Damon's right, there's not a single vampire who hasn't killed a human. Elena will kill and then there will be the pain, the guilt, and then...
 But Elena, she's driven by love; by compassion. If she turns off her humanity, then I don't think we'll ever get her back. So, I'd do anything to save her.
 I never did answer your question.
 If it meant that I got to be with her, have children, grow old with her. If it meant that we'd die together, be buried together, then yes. I'd take the cure.
 I'm sorry, Rebekah.
 I'll take care of it.
 I won't say anything.
 Hey.
 I was just hanging out with Jeremy. We had a couple of things to talk to talk about.
 No. No, nothing new.
 So, uh, what happened?
 Ah, it'll get easier.
 Hey, yes you will. I promise.
 Yes. Hey.
 You just have to hold on.
 
 
 
 
 Well, he could be anywhere now.
 Which means he plans to stay in Mystic Falls to kill vampires.
 Damon's been looking everywhere for him, if they cross paths....
 Be a lot easier if I could just tell him the truth.
 Nice try, Klaus. But I trust Damon a hell of a lot more than I trust you.
 
 Coming up with a plan.
 That's not a plan. We need to be careful. Connor has Jeremy and who knows how many other hostages.
 All right, hold on, you're not all going. 
 Listen, nobody is going anywhere until I figure out what we're walking into.
 This guy is known for setting traps, right? We'd be pretty dumb to walk into one, especially if he has werewolf venom.
 He's had it before.
 
 I can only make out the voices.
 Three. But Elena, it's Matt and April Young.
 I just need a little more time.
 You know, I could do without the colored commentary.
 Did you find the tunnel map?
 Not yet. Klaus is sending one of his men. He'll take the front, you and I can take the tunnels.
 Well, I already told you, Connor has werewolf venom. We need someone to draw his fire, the hybrids are immune to it so they're our best bets.
 Stop being paranoid, Damon.
 I am telling you the truth. This is the best way to get everyone out.
 Damon had the right idea with the tunnels. 
 Do you think he cares about April or Matt? He'll get Jeremy out for you, but then he'll go right after Connor, no matter who gets hurt.
 You're not coming with me, Elena.
 What if Connor attacks and you have to defend yourself? And what if you kill him? The guilt will wreck you.
 I'll get Jeremy out, okay? I promise you.
 Elena, listen to me, listen to me. 
 I want you to free the hostages.
 What? So your hunter's mark can grow? 
 Think about it, Connor. Klaus saved your life. He needs you alive. Aren't you the least bit curious why?
 Follow this map, get out of here, take her to Caroline so she can...
 No one's killing anyone. Go.
 Connor, you don't have to do this!
 Connor, we can end this right now! Just put down the gun and come with me!
 Think about this. No one has to die. I'll tell you everything you need to know!
 Listen to me, if you die right now, then your whole life, all that killing; it'll all be for nothing.
 I can give you the truth. Just put down the gun and let Jeremy go!
 It's over, Damon. I have him.
 I'm taking him with me.
 You better back off, Damon.
 This has nothing to do with Klaus. You're just gonna have to trust me on that.
 
 You're not gonna kill him.
 Klaus will kill anyone who knows.
 Connor's tattoo is the key to a cure.
 For her. For Elena.
 Yeah, and if Connor dies then we'll lose it forever. 
 Elena.
 Hey, hey, come on.
 Angry, full of guilt, hasn't said a word to me other than that she wants to be left alone. Is that my journal?
 He's on a plane, which means I get to live for another six hours.
 Thanks. Thanks for not saying anything to Elena.
 She doesn't need to know that she killed her chance of being human again.
 I believe him, Damon. You didn't hear Klaus' story. I believed every word he said.
 He said there was a Brotherhood of the Five, which means there are other hunters out there and I'm just gonna keep looking until I find one.
 Yet a couple of hours ago, you were ready to rip my heart out.
 What kind of question is that?
 I'll always love her. But she's not supposed to be this person. I don't want her to be.
 What's that?
 Hey.
 What happened? Why did you call me?
 Welcome back. How are you feeling?
 Elena. Hey. Listen, I know you're still upset about yesterday and I get it, believe me, but just let me help you.
 But you'll accept Damon's?
 Listen, it's not what you think, okay?
 Please just...
 School. Bonnie has him volunteering for some occult exhibit.
 It's Klaus.
 You know, I'm glad you find this amusing. If he finds out I told you about the cure, he'll kill both of us.
 I don't want to talk about it.
 Well, it wouldn't have happened, if you hadn't sworn me to secrecy.
 You're using your calm voice today. Who's getting killed?
 What do you know about that?
 I'm at her house.
 It's bad enough I'm out here talking to you. What do you know?
 What kind of consequence?
 What do you mean? Connor's dead.
 She's not going anywhere with you.
 She's stronger than that.
 I'm more worried about what Klaus said about this hunter's curse.
 He said it was a witch's curse.
 Great, you two do your thing.
 I'm gonna get her back.
 He's got Elena. I need Tyler to get the other hybrids away, so I can get her out. I know I'm probably asking the impossible but...
 So...are you telling me that Chris isn't sired anymore?
 All you need to do is get me access to Elena and I'll take it from there.
 Elena. Hey.
 Hey, it's okay. It's me.
 Let me help you.
 Elena, stop!
 
 She's in bad shape. I tried to help her but she attacked me. Listen, you go find her, all right? Talk her down, she'll listen to you. Just tell me what I need to do to end this.
 I'm sorry.
 Nah, it's all right, I probably deserved it. So, um, Damon told me that he clued you in.
 
 I sent him because lately it seems like he's able to get through to you in ways that I can't. You'll listen to him. You trust him, even when you can't trust me.
 Come on, Elena, I mean after everything that we've been through...you can admit it.
 What you want, or...who you want?
 Has been magnified. Your feelings for him have been magnified.
 You know, before when I was the, uh, the Ripper, I understood why you cared for him. I mean, I practically drove you to it. But now...I can't do this, Elena.
 Not anymore.
 Elena and I broke up. By definition, I don't need to be anywhere.
 Oh, I'm not depressed. I just want to rip into someone's artery and feed until I can't breathe anymore.
 She said she has feelings for Damon.
 Yeah, well I don't know what good that'll do. Elena's right, being a vampire really has changed her.
 I'll be fine. Bye.
 The secret's safe. No one who knows about the cure will endanger us. Trust me, you know I want to find it more than anyone else.
 Ah, you know, out.
 Out.
 You obviously haven't heard. Elena and I broke up.
 Okay. And?
 Ah, so you're gonna confront Shane, threaten him, possibly kill him, that sort of thing.
 Nah, I'd say you're on your own.
 Let's not pretend like this isn't the best day of your life.
 Time for a little break. He'll be safe with me.
 Why is there a cop outside?
 You guilty?
 Any regrets?
 You have the chance to make your sister human again. You interested?
 Actually, I do.
 Oh, it doesn't really matter. All that matters is that you're a vampire hunter and he's a vampire.
 Well, almost.
 You think I want to do this, Jeremy? Look at me, I hate this, I don't want to do this. But your sister isn't supposed to be a vampire and we need to help her. Now, he's a murderer and he will gladly kill again, so do it, Jeremy. Kill him.
 Do it, Jeremy or I will rip the chains off for real! Do it!
 All right, enough. He's dead.
 I had no choice. Elena needs the cure.
 You know, I get why you wouldn't want to believe it Damon, but she isn't herself anymore.
 How far did the mark grow?
 Show me on this drawing.
 How far is it, Jeremy?
 Answer me or I will make you answer me.
 What does the mark look like?
 Get him out of here, Matt!
 Let me do it, let me do it, let me do it.
 Elena, wait.
 Elena, wait. It's my fault.
 I'm starting to think that when a Hunter kills a vampire, the urge to keep killing gets stronger.
 We need the map to get the cure.
 He's the only way to fix all of this.
 Pick a room. I'll crash somewhere else.
 Elena's right. I just - I need to let go.
 Caroline, she looked me in the eye and she told me to move on.
 Klaus won't let me even if I wanted to.
 He wants to keep Elena human so that he can make more hybrids.
 What are you talking about?
 Damon.
 She couldn't keep it down.
 Same thing.
 Damon says kill Connor and she kills Connor.
 Elena's sired to Damon.
 Look, we don't know anything for sure.
 No it's not. A vampire sired to another vampire is one in a million. Maybe it won't affect her the same way.
 Wait, no, hold on Caroline. 
 All right talk to Tyler but please don't tell anyone else. If this is true, then it may have influence on Elena's every action and emotion since she became a vampire.
 Hey.
 Yeah.
 Hey.
 Listen, we need to talk.
 It was your blood that turned her, right? I mean, she's been different from day one because of you. You can't deny that.
 All right. You know what? Prove me wrong. Tell her it's OK to drink from a blood bag.
 Right, because you told her to. You said she had to drink warm human blood straight from the vein. She almost died to make you happy. 
 And?
 Right, but Elena's not a werewolf so what's the vampire equivalent?
 What are you doing?
 No, I'm not happy. But what are we gonna do about it?
 New Orleans.
 
 Oh yeah. 
 She was sired to you, and I can only assume you took full advantage of that until you got bored of her, right?
 How'd you do that?
 Who's Valerie LaMarche?
 Well, the city is the same. Just brighter.
 Nope, not since I shipped off to join the war effort and you didn't.
 
 
 Yeah, you know what? I absolutely do.
 No, because it's impossible for her to be so blind that she doesn't see how wrong you are for her. 
 "I'm sorry, I blamed you for my bloodlust and for me becoming a ripper. It wasn't your fault." 
 "You're the only brother I have and I hope that we can be friends again."
 That's the real trick, isn't it?
 Hello, Damon.
 More like bury the hatchet.
 Oh, I doubt I'll be doing much sightseeing. Driving an ambulence through the front lines, but yeah, yeah, Egypt.
 Tell you what, I'll talk to my CO. 
 To the Salvatores in Eygpt!
 I   I  
 I apologize, all right? As much as I hate this sire bond thing, I shouldn't take it out on you. It's not really your fault.
 What, you weren't expecting to find the same exact witch in the same place?
 Maybe there's another place to start. You think Charlotte might be in New Orleans?
 Where was the last place you saw her?
 Corner of Bourbon and Dumaine. See how literal the sire bond is.
 So, what are we gonna tell Elena?
 
 Oh, I see. I see.That's Damon speak for "Let's not do the right thing, let's just do what's right for me."
 What the hell just happened?
 Literally every brick?
 Then why are you still here?
 
 A sacrifice? You brought me here knowing that the spell required a human sacrifice.
 Human sacrifice? Did you really think I would go for this?
 Did you kill those 12 people in 1942?
 Hmm.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. We don't want any trouble okay? We just - we just need your help. That's all.
 Is that like black magic?
 How'd it go?
 Must've been hard. Doing the right thing, especially when it's not something you want to do.
 Well, I mean, selflessness isn't exactly one of your most obvious character traits, Damon.
 I didn't know about that.
 Look, I know it may seem like I'm being unfair about this, like I'm upset about losing Elena to you, and I am. But after all this is over, if she never feels the same way about me as she used to, at least it'll be her choice.
 Look, there's no other way to break a vampire sire bond. As much as you and I both hate it, Damon does love Elena. Now he has to completely let her go. Ever imagine having to do that?
 He'll do it. He's not as bad as he wants you to think. He'll do what he needs to do, he told me he would.
 What do you mean?
 Because I think he loves her as much as I do. He can't be selfish with her. Not anymore.
 Looks like a giant snowflake.
 Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, you know.
 Elena is sired to Damon.
 Which means I need to find the cure now more than ever and yet here you are making postmodern snowflakes.
 Well, Jeremy is the hunter, and he has to keep killing vampires to complete his mark, but we can't quite figure out how to keep him from killing us.
 Hmm, or maybe you're lying about having found the sword.
 I'm not here to bond, Klaus.
 Hey, sorry, I know I'm late.
 I'm at my house. Why? What's wrong?
 Well, she's not here anymore. Damon took Jeremy to the Gilbert lake house with Bonnie so I guess her house is safe for her again. Hey, listen, I got Klaus to tell me a little bit more about this Hunter's sword. You know that map in Jeremy's tattoo? The sword decodes it. It's literally the key to finding the cure.
 Yeah, why?
 Uh, what do you think?
 What's wrong?
 I am. I haven't found anything.
 I'm gonna need real ideas, Damon.
 Nobody's killing Tyler.
 Look, I know it's a touchy subject, but do you know where Elena is today?
 How'd she take it last night? You telling her to stay away from you?
 You okay?
 Hey.
 Nope.
 Klaus is the only shot we have at finding the cure. We need him. Tyler has to call it off.
 Look, all I'm asking you for is a little bit of time, okay?
 I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that.
 
 Come on, Tyler, this is bigger than you. It's about more than revenge for us.
 Relax.
 It's my brother. 
 You're kidding.
 We don't need the sword.
 I've been around.
 I broke into your safe to look for the sword.
 Because I don't trust you.
 I found the letters. You've had a few pen-pals over the centuries.
 You know I thought I'd be happier watching Klaus get led away to his slaughter, but for some reason I can't help but feel kind of guilty.
 See that's the thing, we've all done horrible things.
 And I'm sitting here, trying to figure out what makes us any better than him. And I think it's just that, we have family we can trust.
 Yeah, he's still with Jeremy at the lake house.
 Wait, why are you â€“ why are you asking me this?
 They're together, aren't they?
 How together are they?
 Caroline, tell me. How together are they?
 Well, that's because I'm at a mandatory all-day drinking party.
 My brother slept with Elena. It kinda puts a damper on things.
 His mother just died. What do you expect?
 You think Klaus killed her?
 What?
 Who the hell was dumb enough to pull that dagger out of you?
 How would you like to drive the white oak stake through Rebekah's heart?
 I'm here. What do you want?
 The cure.
 You're wasting your time. We don't know anything.
 She slept with Damon.
 She didn't know it at the time, but she was sired to Damon.
 There's a professor. He knows where the cure is.
 We're done playing your stupid games, Rebekah.
 Go to hell.
 Yes.
 
 What happened?
 It's okay, it's okay! You're okay, you're okay.
 Bonnie, get out of the school. Just be careful. Tyler's out there, and he turned.
 Just go. We'll deal with her later. Come on.
 No.
 Talk about what, huh? How many more ways are there for you to rip my heart out?
 You're sorry that it happened, or sorry that I found out?
 Leave her out of this. This is between me and you.
 Do it.
 Erase it all, every memory.
 I said do it.
 Please, let yourself in.
 You still wanna find the cure?
 Shane's not dead.
 Well, you probably shouldn't have left him alone. Bonnie did a little spell. He's perfectly fine.
 You were right. I'm going to be here for an eternity, and I will go insane if I don't know how Elena truly feels about my brother.
 Twelve...channeling the energy from mass death is used in witchcraft to perform dark spells. It's called Expression. Shane admitted all this to you?
 Well, then, I guess we'll have to figure out how to manage him while we find the cure for ourselves.
 Listen, I hate my brother, and you hate yours. But Damon's got Jeremy, Klaus has the sword, and Shane has Bonnie. You and I are the only ones left with nothing. You said it yourself, right? Whoever finds the cure first gets to decide what to do with it. So what do you say? You wanna be partners?
 
 Right. Well, you can read it all you want. I'm done with her.
 Oh, I know you are. I'm ignoring you.
 If you're here to remind me of our last place status, I'm very well aware.
 I see. You wanna steal it.
 Well. Headstone's not here.
 Not interested.
 I was a psychotic killer with no emotions in the 1920s.
 All right, um...I guess we had a little bit of fun.
 
 Since when did you become such an artifact expert?
 
 Because you wanted me to suffer.
 Hmm. That's awfully bleak.
 The sex wasn't good because we didn't care. It was good because you're crazy. Crazy sex is always good.
 Or maybe somebody compelled him before he ingested it.
 Okay. Fine. So we take him home, wait till the vervain is out of his system, and then compel him and get whatever information we want.
 He just bit off his own tongue.
 I guess he was compelled.
 Maybe it's option number three. There's another team in the race.
 Hey, brother. Long time, no see. 
 Easy there, buddy. You lost a lot of blood.
 Yeah. I didn't really have much of a choice. Kol's compulsion is still in effect, so you need to stay locked up. We don't have any vervain, so...this was the only way I could weaken you.
 
 Come on. You know you can't do that. With the sire bond, all you have to do is tell her to let you out of here. It's too risky.
 It's better for Elena if you stay in here for now, at least until we find the cure, and then once she's no longer sired and you're no longer compelled, you can both do whatever the hell you want. 
 Going to see Damon?
 Well, you can't. He'll just ask you to let him out.
 You won't have a choice. You're sired. 
 And this will be the second time that Damon tried to kill Jeremy. So I guess nobody's perfect, right?
 I never asked you to. You can do whatever you want, Elena. I really don't care.
 Sure it is. You've just never seen me like this. You don't know what I look like when I'm not in love with you. 
 Oh. I thought not knocking was our thing. You didn't dagger Kol.
 That's all right. Jeremy's still alive, and I took care of Damon. So where'd you put it?
 Mm-hmm.
 Wasn't really our deal.
 Do you care?
 Do you even have to ask?
 None...whatsoever.
 Why don't you talk some sense into her? I'm headed home to play prison guard to Damon. He's on lockdown ever since Kol compelled him to kill Jeremy last night.
 Give him a vial of blood every couple of hours, so he doesn't desiccate. If he gets too much strength back, or if he just annoys you, bleed him out again.
 Well, why don't you two enjoy your little, uh, villain bonding time? I'll let you know when I get the dagger from Rebekah.
 Damon's fine. I locked him up with all the creature comforts he deserves.
 What? Is she okay?
 Yeah, Klaus has me trying to convince Rebekah to give up her dagger so he can take care of Kol.
 What did you just say?
 And then what, huh? Klaus and Rebekah will kill every one of us out of spite. They may be dysfunctional bickering lunatics, but they stick together no matter what.
 Yeah, I can't do that.
 All right, fine, but how do you plan to lure Kol in?
 Looking for something to wear to the dance?
 Actually, it was canceled.
 Somebody has some trust issues.
 Sorry, I'm...I'm still trying to get used to this.
 No.
 Maybe.
 You think that I would sleep with you just to get the dagger?
 Why do you care so much about a high school dance?
 Right. Well, we can still go, if you want.
 Since when do you care about the rules?
 I dunno. I kinda miss the old ones. You got any requests for the DJ?
 Oh, that leaves out about half the decade.
 Hope you like The Cure.
 It had its charm. "Say Anything" â€“ Lloyd Dobler standing outside of a bedroom window with a boombox over his head, desperately trying to get back the girl of his dreams; "Princess Bride" â€“ Wesley slays giant rats for love; "The Breakfast Club" â€“ one detention turns a bunch of outcasts into allies.
 Well, I was going to say love, friendship, the possibility of anything happening. You would've loved it.
 Because as much as we both hate to admit it, we care about those things.
 These were all the rage in the eighties.
 Let's dance.
 It's amazing what you can find stashed away in the teachers' lounge.
 This song is the godfather of rock anthems, okay?
 I can't listen to this music without thinking of my best friend, Lexi. We spent most of the eighties together. I remember this one time she snuck us backstage and compelled half the band to do tequila shots with us before the show. She was fearless, kinda like you.
 No, it wasn't like that. I was just a better person when I was with her. I didn't think I'd ever feel that way again.
 Until Elena. And now, that's over.
 Well, you can say that, but we both know it's not true.
 No, you know what? I have a better idea.
 That way.
 Like that.
 Well, that's the whole point of The Breakfast Club slide. It's supposed to be ridiculous.
 No, that's â€“ that's cheating.
 You're just gonna have to do it to find out.
 All right, it's the shoes. Take off the shoes, you'll be fine, okay?
 Come on. Let's go home.
 Listen, Rebekah, they didn't have a choice. Kol started this when he went after Jeremy. He went after you too, do you remember? I mean, he was never going to let us find the cure.
 I'm not gonna let the people that I care about get hurt. Not Jeremy, not Elena, not even Damon. And you can hate me for it, but now he can't hurt you, either. And I want us to find this cure together, you and me. Not just for Elena, but for you. So that you can have what you want, be what you want. Be human again. Everyone deserves a second chance, right?
 I don't know. I guess I could give you my word, but at the end of the day, you just need to take a leap.
 Looks like I didn't miss much. Got the Silas headstone.
 Yeah, I didn't, uh...I didn't dagger her.
 I didn't need to. She's on our side.
 Yeah, she handed over the headstone. I mean, she wants to find this cure more than any of us.
 I bet you were just dying to get that out, weren't you, Damon?
 Yeah, to keep you from killing Jeremy.
 Now, why don't you tell her to calm down, Damon? You've managed to use that sire bond pretty well so far, haven't you?
 You know, you're not really helping.
 You giving Elena the evil eye, it's not really helping.
 Please don't start.
 What is this place?
 We're a day away from finding the cure. I'm not letting it out of my sight.
 Um...you're crushing my arm.
 You do realize you're an Original vampire, right?
 Well, why do you want to take it? Aren't you the perfect vampire?
 
 
 All right, we get it. You two hate each other. Can we just keep going, please?
 Nice catch.
 Haven't we been through here before?
 Sorry. Force of habit. 
 Did you mean what you said? About a cease-fire?
 Well, I mean, you did run her off a bridge.
 What are you talking about?
 
 You think I would do that? You think I would let some psychopath run off with the cure? Every single moment of my last 146 years has been ruled by the pain of being a vampire. 
 Yeah, but if anyone's gonna get him to give it up, it's Caroline.
 Well, maybe he doesn't have to give it up. I mean, Klaus is stuck in Elena's house by Bonnie's spell. He can't go anywhere. There's only so many places you can hide a three-foot piece of metal.
 No. Everyone's here because they want to be. Not just for you, but for themselves too.
 I mean, why wouldn't I want to take it? I've seen every side of vampirism there is. The power...the misery, the guilt. In the long run, even the good parts kind of suck, too.
 Because it had nothing to do with you. I mean, you know how much I wanted a human life with you. Being human myself, being normal   that's something I've wanted since long before I met you.
 Yeah, what's a deeply buried personal secret between friends, right?
 
 So you're sure that Klaus is telling the truth? That there's only one dose of the cure?
 Well, I guess that's what happens when you're dumb enough to hold out hope.
 I'm sorry.
 How so?
 The rest of your life...sired to Damon.
 And after what we did to Kol, if we don't ram that cure down his throat, he'll kill us all.
 
 No, we aren't. 
 All right, come on. We have to catch up.
 And what? You don't care to be that one anymore? You finally decided it was easier to just walk away?
 Things have changed. It's not that easy anymore.
 Where are Jeremy and Bonnie?
 
 
 
 Elena. What happened?
 Who?
 It was Katherine. She must have been following us this whole time.
 If there was anything in there at all, it's all gone.
 I have no idea. She went looking for Jeremy last night. She never came back. Damon, Elena is in there waiting for the Gilbert ring to bring Jeremy back to life.
 Damon, listen to me. Jeremy was one of the Five, a hunter.
 Can I get you anything?
 
 Ever since we found his body. She hasn't said anything except that she's waiting for him to wake up.
 Look. Deep down, I think she has to, but we're talking about Elena here. She feels grief more powerfully than anyone else. I think her denial is the one thing protecting her from letting it all in.
 I know, but I don't want to be the one to break her out of it, not until we know that Bonnie is safe, not until we get Damon over here to, you know 
 
 Well, Katherine's been running from Klaus for 500 years. It's not easy, but it's possible. It's probably why she stole the cure. She wants to bargain for her freedom.
 Yeah. I mean, talk about denial. In my head, I was thinking there was no way Elena was gonna stay a vampire forever...And now without any family.
 We should get Matt over here.
 It's his body. He's starting to decompose. Tell your mom to get Dr. Fell over here.
 
 Yeah, I know. 
 
 
 
 
 Yeah, he said she's fine. Listen, Elena. You might have been right. There might be something.
 Let's just see what she says when she gets home, okay?
 Drop the veil? What does that even mean?
 We told Matt to take her home. We thought it'd be best.
 What are you doing?
 
 No, no, Elena. Stop.
 Damon...Help her.
 What? No, no.
 It was a mistake.
 Her humanity, Damon, that was all she had left.
 
 Listen, Damon. I know that you and I, we've been through some...bad spots lately, especially when it comes to her.
 Well I just, um...I want you to know that, um  
 Look, if you burn down the house, it'll be gone. What if one day when this is all over, you want to come home again?
 We're gonna lose her, Damon.
 Her humanity's off. She's basically numb to everything that makes her who she is.
 She burned down her family home with her brother's dead body still inside.
 No, her brother just died. If you force all that grief on her at once, it's going to overwhelm her. We need to give her a reason to want to turn it on.
 You really think that's gonna work?
 Well, the fun route didn't exactly pay off, did it?
 Look, do you think I want to go to school and play chaperone? You can't go because you're not a student. Besides, you've got to go look for Katherine. I mean, Elena needs this cure now more than ever.
 
 
 
 
 Think about it. Elena's sire bond stems from her feelings for you, right? With her humanity off, she has no feelings.
 I don't know, but more importantly, where are you right now?
 Hey, we need to talk.
 
 I see. You wouldn't happen to know anything about the hospital's missing blood supply, would you?
 Look, Elena, I know what you're going through. I was having the time of my life when I first turned, too. I didn't start ripping people's heads off until 1912. The next thing I know, I was killing an entire village.
 Yeah, you are, because I know how deep down you can fall, and I know how difficult it is to climb back out. Come on. You're better than this.
 Nice move. What do you do for an encore?
 No. I was impressed. Getting yourself on the cheerleading squad. Plenty of vervain-free victims bussed in for the competition. You played us all really well.
 Right. Well, you know, the problem with a gymnasium is, too many witnesses. You gotta go somewhere a little more private for some real fun.
 Oh, I know this little dive bar off the beaten path. 
 You're forgetting that I had my switch flipped in this town, too. 
 But first, a bit of vervain, just to take the edge off.
 Brought you home before you can cause any more trouble.
 No, because you fed on someone...in public.
 
 Sure. When in doubt, manipulate people with sex. 
 Because it's my fault that you're like this. I brought this into your life. 
 Who are you texting?
 What is that?
 
 
 Yeah. It won't last. They'll either drink all the booze and get bored, or, ah, Damon'll come home and kill everyone.
 Yep.
 Pff, I don't know. Enjoy the party, keep Elena from butchering Grove Hills' cheerleading squad. 
 
 What? Elena smiling?
 
 
 
 Yeah. Why? Are you jealous or something?
 Caroline, calm down.
 Right where she wants to be. This is completely calculated. She drew all those people to the house, waited for an opportunity to distract us, and now she's free.
 All right, listen. You search the woods, I'll check the road. If you see her, don't hesitate. Just snap her neck, got it?
 Okay.
 
 You all right?
 
 
 
 Sheriff Forbes. Everything okay?
 Where the hell are you?
 Well, we got a little problem. You said blood was stolen from Grove Hills Hospital? The sheriff said there's been reports of six other blood bank thefts all within 30 miles of Mystic Falls. Somebody's stockpiling blood. It wasn't Elena, and it's not us.
 I think Silas followed us back from that island. He hasn't fed in 2000 years, so he would need to gorge on blood. It explains the thefts.
 Hey, what do you mean you took her to New York?
 Where is she now?
 So I take it your search for Katherine is off?
 And Elena's okay with this little field trip? Just yesterday she was living the vampire high life. She doesn't want the cure.
 Damon, if she finds out you're still looking for it, she'll bolt.
 Don't underestimate her.
 Listen to me. She's ruthless without her humanity. The cure is the fastest way to get it back.
 Actually, I asked him to be here. We need his help. I think Silas is in Mystic Falls.
 It's not Elena.
 Look. Silas wants to die and be reunited with his one true love, but he's supernatural, so if he takes the cure and dies, he gets stuck on the Other Side.
 But if he destroys the Other Side altogether, he can take the cure, die, and pass on, but in destroying it, every dead supernatural being will return to our side.
 Bonnie said Silas needs to complete three massacres to do this spell. Before Professor Shane died, he convinced the pastor to blow up the Council. Next, he had you kill your hybrids, and now he only needs one more massacre, so if he's here, that's what he's doing. We need to find him.
 Well, if Shane really was working with Silas, chances are he was helping him plan his next move.
 Well, we don't know what Silas can do, so if we do have to go head to head with him, an Original hybrid who can't die might come in handy.
 Well, granted my emotions were off.
 My brother knows what he's doing.
 "In some schools of magic such as Expression, human sacrifice can be used as a focus for power. It is rumored that the addition of two supernatural sacrifices compounds the mystical energy, creating an Expression Triangle."
 No, but I talked to her dad. I think I found Silas.
 Well, it would be if you needed to brainwash Bonnie into committing a massacre.
 No, we got it. How's the cure search going?
 What are you trying to find?
 Katherine.
 June fifth, 1473.
 Well, you're welcome. So you headed back now?
 And you're not?
 Stop! It's not what you think.
 She's working for Silas.
 He brainwashed her to kill you.
 Wait. What are you doing?
 Wait.
 They're linked. Bonnie's gonna kill them.
 Hey. How you feeling?
 What do you mean? I  I brought you home. The witches almost killed you.
 You don't remember?
 
 Wait. Bonnie...what's the last thing you can remember?
 Bonnie, there's something you need to know about Jeremy.
 Damon, what did you do?
 Please don't tell me this is going where I think it is.
 I didn't stop the massacre.
 Everything but the cure.
 Well, just be grateful Sheriff Forbes was able to track down the car after you let them, ah, you know, steal it from you.
 Well, they ditched your car after it ran out of fuel. You gotta fill it up. Got a hundred miles before we get to Willoughby.
 
 
 Ooh, dark cloud  Elena stays a vampire forever. Look, why don't you just table the revenge fantasies for now, and just keep your eye on the prize. Find Katherine, get the cure, get out before you get your neck snapped-again.
 Look at that. We're finally on the same page about something.
 Well, this is definitely the car they stole. We're in the right place.
 So let me ask you something. What happens when we find Elena? How do we get her back to Mystic Falls? I mean, she's not exactly gonna go quietly, and she has an Original vampire as her bodyguard.
 I'm serious.
 So what happened to the guy who thought Elena should embrace being a vampire, let the chips fall where they may?
 Ladies, playing nice?
 
 Well, you sort of have to question Elijah's impeccable taste if he's friends with you.
 All right. Where are they? 
 
 No. She's gonna get Elijah to broker the deal for her. That's why you need your little friend, isn't it? Some things never change, Katherine.
 Hello, Elijah.
 Where's Elena?
 Well, I guess the same goes for Katherine.
 Oh you mean the three of us. 'Cause your little sister decided to join Team Good Guys for the time being.
 Well, she's not here right now. I left her with Damon and Katherine.
 Relax. No one's gonna get hurt as long as Katherine hands over the cure.
 Well, just tell me where you are, and we can talk this through.
 No!
 Did you even try to stop her?
 All you had to do was stall her, Damon.
 You let her take it, didn't you? You were never on my side. Now Elena will be a vampire for the rest of her life just like you wanted.
 How do you feel?
 It worked just like she wanted it to. The cure was a fake. It must've been a concentrated shot of vervain or something.
 So what's your point, Damon?
 Was our thing. Look, we've been making the same mistakes for 150 years. We can judge Katherine all we want, but we keep repeating our own history just like she is. Nothing ever changes. It has to stop, Damon.
 I'm done. I can't keep reliving my life like this. I owe Elena her shot at being normal again. Once we give her the cure, I'm getting her out of my life, and I'm getting a life of my own.
 You still want to get the cure, even if it means you might lose her?
 Well, I guess all we have to do is, ah, convince her.
 You all right?
 Elena, this isn't you.
 Listen, I was in the exact same situation that you're in right now. My emotions were off. I wasn't me. And you refused to accept that. You didn't give up on me. You didn't stop until you pulled me back.
 Yeah, eight or nine days. I don't know, I lost count.
 So what are we gonna do, just, ah, throw the football around for another 150 years till Elena gets her humanity back? Because I'm cool with that.
 All right. We could always, ah, make her want it.
 Get her to flip her humanity switch.
 Yeah, and if that doesn't work, then we go to Plan "B"  lock her up, keep her sidelined until you and I figure out a Plan "C".
 Well, then you, my friend, will be right by her side, ready to help her through it.
 Bingo.
 Really? Because the last time I saw you, you snapped a waitress' spine.
 Caroline's been working on this for a while. It's a, ah, photo-yearbook of the senior class.
 Isn't that photo from, ah, the first day of freshman year?
 Oh come on. I'm the one that hates to dance, remember?
 Hm.
 So, you're just here to help Rebekah get the cure, right? On what happens to be the most sentimental night in high school?
 So this...us. You feel nothing?
 I don't believe you.
 So you don't remember what it used to feel like when we would dance? When my hand would touch your waist?
 Hm. How about this? When our fingers would touch?
 And this?
 Does your heart really refuse to remember?
 Caroline, why don't you come dance with me, hm?
 
 Mm?
 You know you have him wrapped around your little finger, right?
 I don't know. I think it's affecting me a lot more than it's affecting her.
 Every time I tell myself that I'm moving on, there's this part of me that just can't seem to shake her.
 Well, then how does anyone ever seem to move on?
 Bonnie, that's what Silas does. You can't let him get to you again.
 Look, one of us should take her home.
 You looking for Silas or are you waxing nostalgic about misspent youth?
 What do you mean?
 I mean, isn't that what we're doing, reminding Elena of what she's lost?
 Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
 I mean...I don't mean to be a dick, Damon, but Elena and I have a history. Memories, laughs, ups and downs. It was a real relationship. I mean, what you have is just a one-night stand that was probably the result of the sire bond.
 Your mind is a very dark and riveting place, Damon.
 Yeah. I'm over here. Agh!
 Yeah.
 Bonnie, stop. Bonnie.
 Bonnie, you're killing her.
 That's the magic talking. This is your best friend.
 
 Okay. Hey, whoa.
 Plan "B".
 So what's the plan?
 Fear.
 So Plan "C"...Make her life a living hell.
 Silas still needs Bonnie. And if tonight is any indication, she's no pushover. She's not gonna let him manipulate her, not anymore.
 He led me out in the woods, claiming he saw Silas, and then he staked me.
 How'd he get to you?
 Funny.
 
 Look, she's not gonna beg for blood. Begging means desperation, emotion. She's still in no-humanity zone.
 A lot hungrier than she is now, apparently.
 Katherine.
 Wait, what do you mean he's gone?
 You still have her locked in the safe? You've been in her head for an hour. What, still nothing?
 We're not letting anyone see her, that's the whole point. Isolation leads to misery leads to emotion.
 Look, she doesn't want to, Caroline, not yet. She's devastated; she lost her brother, she-she attacked her friend, she killed an innocent woman.
 I did say that. We are.
 It's not torture, it's an intervention. The only chance we have with her is to provoke her, to trigger something. Fear, anger, self-pity, anything.
 Good luck.
 You will be. And when you are, focus on that fear. It's the key to getting your humanity back.
 Elena, look at me. We don't wanna do this, okay? You can stop this right now. It's your choice.
 Look, I know what you're going through. After all you've done, you're afraid to face the guilt you'll feel if you turn your emotions back on. Only way we can help you is to make the alternative hurt even worse.
 So, that went well.
 Because she has nothing to come back to. Her home's gone, her family's gone, she alienated her friends, she destroyed her relationships 
 All right, so we get somebody else. Somebody who really will hurt her.
 Think about it  she's the reason Jeremy's dead, right? So if anybody's gonna provoke an emotion, it's her.
 Katherine was just abandoned by Elijah. She has nothing, she has no one. We invite her into our house to come torture Elena? There's no way she's gonna turn that down.
 She's gone.
 Elena's not in her cell. I'm gonna check the grounds. Find out what she did.
 Hey, hey, you're cut off.
 Stop it.
 Damon.
 Hey, hey, look at me, look at me. I know this stage, okay? The emotions are overwhelming you. You just have to focus on one thing, okay?
 You just find that one thing inside of you that makes you strong. It's in there, just latch onto it. Channel everything you're feeling into that one emotion. Find the thing inside of you that makes you wanna live. Elena, let it in. Let it in.
 That's good. That's it. That's it, just breathe it in. Blow everything else out. That's good, that's good.
 Elena, what you need to do is rest. Take it easy for a couple of days. Maybe even a couple of years. Here.
 Elena, Katherine's not worth your time. Even if you spend ten minutes of your life hating her, she wins.
 And?
 Hm. Okay.
 Again.
 Good. Now, focus on letting it go.
 I don't know where Katherine is and, even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.
 I realize that, I just figured it would be love or hope or compassion, not unwavering hatred for a ruthless vampire that's 500 years older than you.
 All right, give me fifty pull-ups.
 I know, and I couldn't.
 I don't think you really want to.
 Yeah, I was with Elena, burning off a few thousand hate-filled calories. What happened to you helping me?
 Mm, you're avoiding. How unexpected.
 Hey.
 And it didn't?
 Unless he's fueling up for something big.
 Well, these are the locations of the Silas massacres. It's the Expression triangle. Bonnie must be doing the spell.
 But...Caroline's with Elena.
 Well, they must be some where in the triangle. My guess is that they would be right in the middle.
 Where's Caroline?
 All right, let me know if you find anything.
 Hey, there you are. Any luck?
 Hm. Ice is melting.
 Actually, I think we're in the right place...
 Well, where's the basement?
 All right, I'll meet you there.
 Bonnie. Bonnie, what happened?
 Get the hell out of here before I kill you myself.
 Yeah, and so was Bonnie. Bonnie used a spell to link herself to Katherine, so if you killed her, Bonnie would be dead, too.
 Because I saw her, Elena. You almost killed your best friend.
 Really?
 Listen to yourself. Your rage is making you crazy.
 This isn't even about Katherine, this is about Jeremy. What, you think that killing her will take all that pain away? It won't.
 No, it's a distraction. Just like killing Katherine, just like turning your emotions off. The truth is, there are no shortcuts. You are a vampire, Elena. Loss is part of the deal. Look, I've been alive for 163 years. I have lost more loved ones than I can count, and it hurts me every single time.
 No, I'm saying you have to face your grief. But you don't have to do it alone - I can help you.
 You're transferring your rage onto me, that's good.
 Hey 
 Let's leave it at that, shall we?
 All right, so let's do what we should've done to Klaus - let's drop his body in the middle of the ocean.
 I should, ah, make sure Kol's body is somewhere safe until the veil goes back up.
 Welcome back.
 Yeah, I'm not really in the mood to, ah, celebrate.
 There was someone that I thought I would see today, and, ah...I didn't. That's all.
 You've got to be kidding me.
 Yep.
 So wait, you've been back, what, 5 minutes and you're already laughing at me?
 Do you have any idea how much I've missed you?
 What are you giving me that look for?
 Do not start.
 Damon! Help me celebrate my 17th high school graduation. 
 You reap what you sow, buddy.
 You're right. How selfish of me to be indulging in these precious moments with my formerly dead best friend. I should be sacrificing my own happiness for the good of others, right? I should be upstairs grooming my hero-hair.
 I don't know, Mom, am I?
 What, they don't give you a rulebook over there?
 What am I supposed to do, tell her it's her choice? Because that worked out so well. You know, it's funny, those two are in there arguing about how to protect the world, and they have yet to address their biggest issue.
 The sire bond's gone. Elena's emotions are back. She finally knows exactly how she feels.
 She's the love of my life. I'd go back to her in a heartbeat. But, if that's not how she feels, then maybe that's exactly what I need to hear to get my ass out the door. Maybe I will move to Australia. I can live in a yurt.
 The hell are you doing?
 They're not giving it to Silas. Wherever Damon is taking Vaughn right now, it's to stall, because Damon hasn't had time to bury Silas' body yet. 
 It was one bullet, and it was only laced. We still have a little bit of time. I will go to New Orleans myself and I will beg Klaus if I have to.
 Ah, I don't â€“ I don't hug...
 Okay, just hang on a little longer. Caroline's calling Klaus again.
 You know it's not polite to eavesdrop, right?
 Sure.
 So, what's up?
 I, ah...I kind of owed you one.
 No, Elena, I'm not gonnaâ€“
 Think the quarry will be deep enough to bury Silas?
 Yeah.
 No, it's all right. I got Lexi coming with me.
 Hey, Damon.
 I'm not happy about Elena...but I'm not not-happy for you, either. I just want you to know that.
 Too close.
 Ugh, no. Too touristy.
 What if Elena was...the one?
 I've never been to Portland.
 See ya, Lexi.
 Listen...I'm glad you're okay with who you are now. But every single thing I did to get this, I did for you, so that the choice of whether you wanted to be a vampire or not would always be yours.
 Silas. You were stone. They saw you, the spell worked.
 Bonnie? Bonnie's not dead.
 So, this is finally your real face? You're another one of them?
 The answer's 'no,' Damon.
 Won't take the pain away.
 And then what, huh? Let's just say that you actually notice that I'm gone, let's say I get out of this. What good is it if I'm a monster again? How is that better than any of this?
 Did you forget how long it took me to come back last time? Everything I lost in the process?
 What are you doing here?
 "Silas..."
 These are the good moments...the simple ones, the ones that matter. These are the moments that keep me from falling apart.
 Run. RUN!
 I don't want to hurt you, so get away from me before I rip your throat out.
 You saved me from burning to death outside that bar this morning, didn't you?
 How do you know I'm a doppelgÃ¤nger?
 Who are you?
 Huh...I know that he's a bloodthirsty immortal who's killed more people than I can count, and that was before he stole my identity, locked me up in a safe, and dropped me in the bottom of a quarry.
 Barely. I came very close to flipping off my humanity switch, but I didn't because I knew if I ever got out, I wanted to be myself when I killed him.
 He's a monster, and I'm going after him.
 How do you know all of this?
 You're telling me that you were Silas' one true love?
 That's impossible. How are you here right now?
 Yeah, look. I know the story. Everything was great for Silas until some witch named Qetsiyah or whatever came by and screwed him over, right?
 Like any other sane, rational, well-adjusted woman would do.
 Look, if you really are Silas' one true love and you're not dead, then why don't you just do us all a favor and run off into the sunset together?
 What are you doing here? I thought you were dead and on the Other Side.
 Do you have a, uh, cell phone? I have to make a phone call.
 Well, no offense, Qetsiyah. I'm having a bit of a hard time believing what you're saying.
 So, that's why you rejoined the land of the living...souvenir keychains?
 Well, two thousand years is a hell of a long time to hold a grudge.
 I'm sorry.
 So, Silas was the first version of me, and your friend was te first version of Elena?
 DoppelgÃ¤ngers.
 You want to tell me what the hell you've been doing this whole time?
 Ah. Got it. So what's your, uh, plan? Take the cure and shove it down Silas' throat? Kill him?
 You took him down before, right?
 Is that where Amara is right now, locked away in a tomb?
 That's what you call a second chance?
 How's that working out for you?
 I take it you're not really making me a daylight ring, are you?
 All right, listen. We're on the same side. I want Silas gone as much as you doâ€”
 Nice to see you, too, Damon.
 Well, Silas' ex-girlfriend decided to come back from the Other Side.
 Wait. Katherine took the cure?
 Yep, yep. He's right.
 Just do it, all right? Just get it over with. Do it.
 Uh, I'm sorry...Iâ€”I have no idea who you people are.
 
 
 I know "nada" means nothing. I know what day it is, I know what year it is, I know this car has a V-8 engine, and yet I am two journals deep, and I have absolutely no memory of who the hell I am.
 And, is this supposed to fill me up?
 Weird.
 Ahh, yes. The insatiable and blood-lusting vampire, Ripper of Monterrey.
 Well, sorry, but this is a lot to process.
 So, let me get this straight. I helped you steal this car, I found out I was a vampire who killed his own father, and yet I don't litter?
 Yeah. Well, I bet that two thousand-year-old witch probably drives a little faster than you. Wait. Let me guess. 
 What are you doing?
 Do I really have a choice?
 
 Wow. Ahh. This town always so upbeat about dead people?
 So, we have a holiday dedicated to burying people alive?
 What the hell was that?
 So, what's the problem? You spent the whole day trying to convince me I was a vampire. I'm convinced. Let me act like one.
 Well, I'm no shrink. Right?
 But maybe killing our father and turning into a vampire and all the trauma associated with that is what made me become a vampire who feeds on people and then rips their heads off, but now that I don't have all those memories and all that guilt, maybe the Ripper thing won't be such a problem.
 Remind me of your name again.
 Elena. Right.
 Don't scream. 
 What kind of name is "Honoria Fell"?
 Oh.
 So, this is the family crypt, huh?
 Anybody here I didn't kill?
 Oh, good.
 Well, I, uh, I certainly hope your family history was happier than mine.
 Wait. Jeremy that lives in our house?
 Hmm.
 How do I not remember you? I mean, you're smart, you're pretty, you're funny. Obviously, you're the strongest woman in the world if you managed to figure out a way to get through all that.
 So, bonded by death? Please don't tell me that we met in a cemetery.
 Really? We met in a cemetery?
 Yeah, sure.
 No. Sorry.
 Sure.
 Hey, Elena. As frustrating as it is for me not to have any memories, I really don't think that re-creating the time we met is magically gonna bring it all back.
 I'm strange? You were the one coming out of the men's bathroom. Do I even want to know why?
 Yeah, sure.
 You close your eyes.
 All right.
 How the hell do I get up there?
 Okay.
 All right. Well, I have to admit that was, uhâ€”that was actually pretty amazing.
 Right. You mean, when we dated.
 I may have amnesia, but I'm not an idiot. I'm a hundred and sixty-four-year-old vampire who went back to high school, so I'm guessing that had something to do with you?
 And obviously we're not together anymore, so I have a feeling me ripping people's heads off might have been a little bit of a turn-off.
 So, I bored you to death?
 How'd you become a vampire?
 Okay.
 How is it cosmically possible to get into two accidents on the same bridge?
 But if I was there both times, then why didn't I save you both times?
 Ah. Got it. So, I'm an idiot.
 Well, it's gonna take me a minute to wrap my head around that.
 It's working, you know?
 No. I mean, this, whatever we're doing, the distracting, the subliminating, whatever you wanna call it. The urge to feed has settled. I'm not, uh, hungry anymore.
 Whatever monster I was capable of being, I could see why I was different around you.
 Elena, I saw my reflection in the mirror today. I was scared of me.
 Don't.
 You're with my brother.
 And neither of you thought that was something that I should know?
 And just like that, the hunger returns.
 Caroline Forbes, my best friend.
 Well, I've studied pictures. You're much hotter in person. 
 Well, if by "okay" you mean heavily spiraling into Ripper oblivion, then yes, I'm dandy.
 Yeah. It's probably a good idea because I can sense from here that you have a paper cut on the palm of your left hand, and I want to rip your entire arm off.
 What about blood bags? Do you have any blood bags?
 There. That wasn't so bad, was it? I did it. I stopped.
 Oh, I'm a Ripper. You know what that means? That means I literally can't stop feeding until I rip someone's head off. But look at us. We're working it out.
 I know I should let you out. I'm good, right? I'm compassionate. I live with this burning hunger inside of me that allows me to stay in control, but what do I have to show for it, huh?
 I have no memories because my brain was fried. My brother, who's been my brother for a hundred and sixty-some-odd years, stole my girlfriend, and my girlfriend let him, so you tell me...
 I have to go.
 I have to leave.
 Well, you know, just tying up a few odds and ends.
 Well, I know what I don't want. I don't want to be the person in these journals anymore. I don't want to live in this house. I don't want my brother's advice. I don't want to hear how I supported you, Elena, and I definitely do not want to continue this conversation.
 Don't worry. I'm not gonna go on a Ripper binge. Besides, Carolina said she'd call me every hour to make sure I was okay and, uh...I actually do trust her.
 Hmm. I'm feeling better, which in my world means I haven't committed a homicide since I last saw you. I've been doing a lot of thinking today, a lot of wandering around, and this seemed like the most appropriate place to come. 
 Uh...Whatâ€”what happened?
 Hmm.
 I'm sorry. I...I wish that I could remember her.
 It's okay.
 Me. You have me. Look. You were there for me last night. Sounds like you're always there for me. 
 
 
 No offense, but actually, I have no idea who a lot of people are.
 The girl who wiped my memories.
 You, my brother, make a terrible wingman.
 So, what exactly, are we doing here?
 Uh! Hey, hey, breaking my neck, huh?
 Pumping me full of vervain. All we need is a Damon-sized rationalization.
 How would the old me deal with this? Barrel full of laughs?
 Oh, who's it about Damon, huh? About you? Your desperation to prove to Elena that you're a worthy boyfriend?
 How does it feel, brother?
 Silas. Tessa, that's Silas.
 He's working with my brother. Everything he said to you was a lie.
 Oh. Tessa. Hi.
 Umm. I think both. I'm still trying to piece together last night.
 Thanks. What's got you in such a good mood?
 Great. Fine. I approve. Where is it?
 So, Silas read your mind and figured out where the anchor is. Now what?
 Why not?
 Um, you know what? I...think I still need to be drunk to understand this story.
 Yeah? Well, what if they fail?
 Why not?
 Well, the one good thing about having amnesia is that I don't remember  how I got in the middle of all this.
 
 How do you know that?
 Elena. You shouldn't have walked through that door.
 Sure you would've. You have this annoying tendency to do anything he tells you to do.
 Who said I was sleeping with Tessa?
 Yeah. You really shouldn't have come inside.
 Tessa! 
 Look. Why don't we forget about the pizza. What do you say I make something?
 Wait. Do you have a duck?
 All right.
 Try this. Let me know what you think.
 Yeah?
 All right.
 
 Elena, run!
 Well, uh, have a good night.
 Well, Tessa was gonna kill you, and you don't seem like you deserve that, so I was just going on instinct, that's all.
 Well, have a good night.
 What are you doing here?
 You're hurt. I can heal you.
 
 
 Stop it. Stop it, please.
 Ohh...Not great.
 If we're gonna talk about Tessa, I think I'm gonna need that caffeine. 
 I was driving to Portland.
 The night I took Silas to the quarry, I said goodbye to Lexi, and then I decided to keep driving west.
 Because my memories are back.
 Tessa came here last night and she undid whatever spell fried my brain and it's all back. I can remember everything.
 You broke my nose trying to teach me how throw a right hook.
 That's a trick question. You bought me that motorcycle, although I'm guessing it was pretty expensive.
 Well it wasn't exactly a gift. It was a lot to take in at once, everything from blowing out the candles on my first birthday cake to drowning in a safe. 
 All that and I still can't remember my own strength. 
 Katherine?
 
 So, you're telling me that this girl is the only thing holding together the other side?
 Well, considering she's immortal, I'd say we have plenty of opportunity.
 How would you plan to do that?
 Yeah, but you know what's great about the bus? Open road, Damon. There's all this time to think, watch everyday human beings in their normal environment. Did you know that gas is over three dollars a gallon at the moment? It seems to really concern a lot of people.
 Yeah. I've been thinking about that. Amara needs to die.
 I've been thinking about that, too, Damon. Remember when I told you that the universe is working to draw our doppelgÃ¤ngers together and you laughed in my face? Well, if you don't bring Bonnie back from the Other Side, then you'll be breaking your promise to Elena, and the idea of jeopardizing your relationship brings me this perverse amount of joy, so I've decided not to help you, Damon, and I will see you soon. I'm looking forward to all this being over. Bye.
 Weren't you listening to anything? He's not gonna bring her back.
 You know what? You're right. I do know you. You put your hope in all the wrong places and sometimes 
 Well, as someone who just spent the last 3 months at the bottom of a quarry because of the guy, I wouldn't hold your breath, pun intended. Silas needs to die, and I need to be the one to kill him, end of story.
 Yeah? Well, if I don't kill him, he wins.
 You know, there were these moments in that safe, a stillness in time when I was dead right before I was about to come back to life, I would think about things in the past that made me happy, things that gave me hope. All these things kept me sane. They pushed me to hang on when all I wanted to do was give up and turn off my humanity, but eventually, the pain took those moments away from me, too.
 Every time I close my eyes, I can see Silas stabbing me, I can feel myself drowning, and I need to make it stop. If I don't kill him, I'm gonna lose my mind, or I'm gonna turn off my humanity...Or both.
 
 I know that, which is why I'm gonna take her away, and I'm gonna keep her alive by any means possible while everyone else hunts you down like an animal. You now have nine minutes.
 Remember me? I remember you. I'm sorry, is it hard to breathe? Is your throat closing? Did the fear of dying start to creep in yet?
 Stop it!
 Yeah, it's over.
 I'm fine.
 Why is this so important to you?
 Yeah, and he's dead.
 I wanted it to be you. When that safe finally opened and somebody found me...I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be both of you.
 No. No. It's over. It's supposed to be over.
 Yeah, I'm fine.
 Knock yourself out.
 One pity drink.
 What is wrong with you?
 So I could avoid talking to anyone.
 Look, I thought that killing Silas would allow me to move on with my life, but I was wrong.  I spent my summer locked in a safe. One minute, I think I'm fine, and the next, I feel like I'm dying all over again.
 Should've known this was gonna come around to you needing something from me.
 Okay. Okay. All right.  What do you need?
 Just out of morbid curiosity, which one of you is younger?
 Right.
 What the hell was that?
 Easy. Easy.
 I would much rather be getting drunk right now, so why don't you stop wasting our time, and tell us what you're doing here?
 What did you just do?
 Get away from me. 
 I can't do that. Do you understand me?
 Gius...Giuseppe Salvatore.
 Thomas Fell.
 Honoria Fell, Marianna Lockwood, Christopher Gilbert, 
 Thank you.
 What are you doing?
 And what problem has you jumping off of a clock tower?
 
 I'm just trying to make sure you don't slit your wrists.
 I'm trying to make sure you don't kill yourself.
 I'm fine.
 I am dealing with it.
 So does this mean you want to live?
 What are you doing here?
 Really?
 I spent three months drowning in this thing. What the hell were you thinking?
 And you're sure you're not just sublimating your feelings about what happened to Jesse last night?
 He was out of control, and Elena did what she had to do.
 Anyways, aren't you a drama major? What do you know about PTSD?
 Caroline! Do you even know what you're doing?
 Caroline? Caroline!
 
 Let me out of here! Caroline!
 Caroline, get me out of here before I hurt her!
 
 
 
 
 
 Any reason why you chose to have this conversation with me locked in a safe?
 How could you say that to me?
 You know, for the record, I, uh, I only broke one of these. 
 
 To be honest with you, I never know exactly what you're doing, Katherine.
 Hmm. Hey.
 What are you doing?
 Where are you going?
 Where the hell you been?
 What a minute. What do you mean you can't find Elena?
 Are you talking about the Whitmore bio teacher?
 You just said you don't know where she is.
 Sit.
 Well, they're not at his lab, so where else could he hide a vampire?
 I'm sorry. I'm what?
 Oh, I see. You're jealous.
 You want to give me a little back story as to how you know one another?
 Why do you know this?
 What do you mean test subject?
 Wait. Hold on a minute. 
 
 I didn't think so.
 Who the hell are you?
 Where's Elena?
 We have Aaron, and we're trying to decide how to kill him.
 That threat works both ways.
 
 He doesn't care. He's willing to risk it.
 Well, you didn't die, obviously.
 
 This guy was your cellmate for five years, you left him to die, he comes back, and you're completely unfazed?
 Knock yourself out. We're going with plan B.
 
 Hurry up.
 Was this all a lie, huh? If you want me to kill you, I will kill you. Do not test me.
 What are you talking about?
 Talk.
 You know, not all of us are like my brother.
 Elena!
 Oh, God. Ohh.
 Come here. 
 Come on. Come on.
 Can I come in, or are you gonna freak out and run away again?
 Heh. Katherine Pierce's chickens come home to roost in the form of wrinkles. It's kind of brilliant.
 Hmm. So what are you, uh, doing in my room?
 Okay.
 
 Katherine, what do you expect? You want me just forget everything that you've put me through for the last 147 years?
 I know you are, and I'm sure that you will figure a way out of it.
 147 years is a long time to forgive in one night.
 Hey. 
 The doctors think it was a heart attack.
 She's dying. Every single organ in her body is failing. Vampire blood can't save her. I compelled the doctors to let me take her home, so she's more comfortable, but...she's dying. They don't think she'll survive the rest of the day.
 Well, she's going to want to talk about this.
 They're reminiscing.
 It looks fine.
 Okay.
 You know, even on your deathbed, you're vain.
 It's not an age spot, Katherine.
 You're dying. I think I can muster up a bit of compassion.
 All right. Knock it off or take it somewhere else. You guys are being insensitive.
 In 1864, Katherine moved into my home, she compelled me to love her, seduced my brother, fed us full of vampire blood and then started a war with the town that got us killed.
 But, centuries before that, she was just an innocent girl that was shunned by her family. So for five hundred years, she lied and manipulated and did whatever she had to do to survive. And she did. She's a survivor, right? So that's the girl I will drink to today. Cheers.
 Bottle's empty...I shouldâ€“
 Which is what, exactly?
 Gregor was going to kill her and she was defending herself.
 ...Now that I slept with her? I'm sure you have plenty to say about that.
 I have a feeling the right price for the deal was us.
 I guess we probably picked the wrong day to be in a fight, huh?
 No.
 Depends. If I kill him, do you think the rest of these boards fall down?
 I guess it's a good thing I'm not claustrophobic anymore.
 She did.
 You can.
 But I don't. I know I should, but for some reason, I keep rooting for her to find peace. And Katherine's not the only one, you know. Damon keeps pushing you away because he hates himself...who he is, what he's done. Just remember that you never gave up on me. So don't give up on him. Don't let him give up on you either, okay?
 Come on.
 What the hell happened to you?
 Damon...
 Close your eyes. I came to say "bye".
 You will.
 Open your mind to me.
 Look at your father...
 You deserve to feel peace.
 You were a seventeen-year-old girl, Katherine. None of this is your fault.
 You know, I was in a dark place, Damon.
 You know, whatever's going on with you and Elena...you need to fix it. She's the best thing that ever happened to you.
 I'm not giving you a look.
 I will keep that in mind.
 Have we really gone through four bottles of bourbon today?
 Where you been?
 Define "out."
 That's funny.
 Could be a bit of a problem...
 Damon... who cares? Katherine's dead. Just give her the damn body.
 Yeah.. well, I kind of convinced him that he was an idiot.
 And now he's in a bit of a mood.. and something tells me he's been trying to get a hold of Elena and she hasn't been returning his phone calls.
 Caroline.. how would you like to be judged solely based on what you're attracted to?
 Why? Should I know something?
 Listen.. I actually think that Elena is good for Damon. She makes him happy and we all know that when Damon is happy.....
 Exactly.
 She told me she was staying at Whitmore.
 I'm not giving you the pouty face. This is my "you're being a dick face." Elena hasn't called you back. It's making you completely miserable.
 No. You're miserable because you did what you always do... You had a problem and instead of dealing with it, you cut ties and you ran.
 I invited her. Caroline agreed to help you get Elena back.
 We're just hanging out.. chatting.
 Oh. I guess we better try Elena again.
 Elena; You're alive!
 No. I'm trying to keep off from the hard stuff. So, where have you been? Caroline was about to send out a search party for you.
 Hmm. You know he made a mistake, right? He wants you back.
 It's incredibly weird, but I know my brother. I know he's a better person with you than without you.
 I'm okay.
 No honestly.. I'm okay. You know, we had a thing, it ended and she died and I'm fine.
 A funeral?
 I have no idea. Damon said he put her where she was always meant to be.
 What's the matter with you?
 You know, drunk or not, she doesn't deserve that.
 Damon.
 Hey. There you are. I've been looking all over for ya.
 Hmm.
 Hmm. So that's why you came here, huh? Alright. let me ask you something. When you found out about me and Katherine, what was your first thought?
 See and if you held that against me, you wouldn't be sitting here right now, with me, would you?
 Ahh. Somebody has to say it. So here goes.. Are you ready? Caroline, you are a horrible person.You are thoughtless. You are shameless. You are shallow and completely undependable.
 You know what? Now that I think of it.. I have no idea what Klaus saw in you. What was he thinking?
 You want to tell me what the hell's going on out in the driveway?
 Huh. (He stares at Damon.)
 Yeah.
 So Elena breaks up with you, and your first instinct is to go in a killing spree? Could you be any more predictable?
 So, what, you guys are old pals again, murder buddies, is that it?
 Is that the plan? Kill off Augustine and then go back to your sadistic, psychotic old self?
 Hmm.
 Come on, Damon. You're better than this.
 I see Damon's got you on shallow grave duty.
 I'll pass. Buried enough skeletons out here.
 I think you need to find yourself a new best friend. Damon's in a bad place right now, and you're not really making things better. I know you just got out of captivity and you're looking to blow off a boatload of steam, which is fine. Just... do me a favor. Leave my brother out of it.
 Why don't you be a mate, huh? Get in my car, start driving and don't look back.
 What I do to you, Enzo, will be final. You got it? Be sure I never see you again.
 Hey. Listen. I need to talk to you, but I didn't want to do it over the phone.
 Let's just say it involves Enzo.
 Yeah. No, thanks. I already did the college thing. Twice actually.
 Hey.
 I did. So, who thinks up these things?
 Ah.
 You seem good.
 Did I say that?
 Oh, I have a look?
 Hmm.
 Hmm. Elena, listen. I need to talk to you about something. Damon he got himself into some bad stuff.
 Do I what?
 Elena, I 
 You know what? Could we talk about it later? Is that ok?
 Ok.
 Hey.
 Sure. Yeah, no. She's all yours.
 Hey.
 Oh. No. No. No. You are the second person that I didn't come here to dance with.
 Way to eavesdrop, Caroline.
 Okay. Fine. Damon fell off the deep end.
 For starters, he killed Elena's friend, Aaron.
 Yeah and I came here to tell her, but we were dancing.. she seemed so happy and I just couldn't...
 Yeah. I know she will. And I don't think I can pull Damon back from that. I mean, I've seen Damon at his worst, Caroline, and I actually think he enjoys the way it makes him feel. It's like the more pain he can cause, the more reasons there are for people to hate him. He wants to confirm everyone's lowest expectations of him and I just honestly don't know how to fight that side of him.
 What are you doing here?
 How about you just answer the damn question?
 Hey, Damon. Don't bother coming back.
 Yeah. Sure.
 Got it.
 Yeah. I I should have told you. Sorry.
 You want be to be honest?
 Alright. The truth is, ever since the first time I noticed you falling for my brother, I have been waiting for him to screw something up so badly that you hate him. So I've been waiting and watching him do all these horrible things and then every single time I think he's gone too far, he's there for you, sometimes in ways better than I ever was. So the truth is, after a while I just stopped waiting for him to fail because I liked the person he had become   and I don't want to lose that person.
 I know.
 Roman empire
 Han Dynasty
 Holy Roman Empire
 There goes your perfect score!
 No, no, no. The book says it was 1806
 Well if you want to pass the test I suggest you write down exactly what's in the textbook.
 Oh, Caroline's here, I asked the sheriff to help me track down Damon.
 Let me guess  missing persons and animal attacks?
 Damon's feeding on vampires...
 I shouldn't have let him go.
 I guess Wes must have injected him with whatever he was going to give Elena that makes vampires feed on vampires.
 I have to find him.
 The incident? You mean the time when he almost killed you?
 Sure.
 The bad news is that Tyler hates you. The good news is..... hmmm
 We... there's nothing weird going on between me Elena and me.
 She's here with her friend studying without the implied quotes.
 I'm about to spend 12 hours in a car with her alone, so whatever she's feeling, I'm sure I'll be able to figure it out.
 What are you talking about? This car is a classic.
 You know, uh, I appreciate you being here, but you didn't have to come.
 and you don't think he can? Look. I know that he crossed the line with Jeremy, but, you know, he has crossed many lines before.
 I'm just saying, you've never really closed him off like this before.
 Uhh. Sure. What do you want?
 Coming right up.
 Careful, there's grease on it.
 I have no idea how this hose ripped out, but we're not going to be able to go anywhere until I get a new one.
 Ahh. I guess I'll see if that mechanic has a spare.
 You weren't careful at all.
 You loved that shirt.
 Now there's grease all over your face.
 No. I should probably stay here in case they finish early, but you can go.
 That's funny.
 Sure, Be right there.
  What did you do, bring your entire closet?
 Hmm. We'll get him back. He's hurt, but he's not a lost cause.
 Because I know what he's going through.
 You don't know what it's like being in love with you. You know, when you and I were together, every single atom in my body told me that it was the right thing, that we were a perfect fit. And that kind of love, it can change your whole life. And then when somebody who made you feel that way suddenly stops, the vacuum is just...
 He's not handling it right, but he's not gone.
 uhh. I should go wash up.
  The car's done.
 Yeah. Sure.
 Yeah. We have a long night ahead of us, so maybe we should just..
 What exactly happened in here?
 Well, that's not going to happen.
 I'm not afraid of you, Damon
 Elena, he's going to feed...
 Damon, STOP!
 Damon, Let go of her. Let go of her! LET GO!
 Here. Damon, look over here. Do you smell that? Feed on me, not on her.
 That's good. Feed on me. Feed on me
 I never should've told you to leave.
 Ah. Come on, Damon. You think I'm afraid of a ripper? Who do you think invented the word? You know that feeling you get when you're around vampire blood? That burning in your veins.. I feel that on a daily basis and there's a way to control it.
 No. That's a good guess, but right now, I'm going to go get you a little bit more vervain and then I'm going to go get another drink and let you think about what a royal pain in the ass you've been lately. You're my brother, I'm not going to give up on you. I never will.
 You're talking about Elena?
 She practically got herself killed to prove a point today.
 Yeah. so.
 So, what are you saying? Are you saying that Elena wanted me to kill you?
 Hey. When'd you get here?
 Hmm...
 Glad I could help. So, did you find Matt?
 What do you mean? What kind of things?
 Huh.
 Um, well, the verdict is... she's acting strange. She kissed me.
 Yeah. My car broke down, so we got a hotel room so she could shower and...
 Yeah, but it wasn't like that.. I mean, I stopped it, obviously. I couldn't do it to Damon.
 That's what I mean, it's like she's given up on Damon; and he thinks that she was trying to get me to kill him tonight.
 Unless... Matt texted you "help. K" before Nadia stopped him. "K", as in Katherine. And when Katherine was dying, Nadia figured out a way to put Katherine's spirit inside Nadia's body.
 We haven't noticed that Katherine's been inhabiting Elena's body for weeks, and that's all you have to say?
 And you realize that it was Katherine who broke up with you. It wasn't, uh, Elena.
 Right. So, your little murder spree with Enzo, where you, uh, killed Aaron, you nearly killed Jeremy, AND you tried to kill Wes, but you got infected with that ripper virus. That was all you reacting. To Katherine.
 I have it under control.
 Well, did she lure you into a hotel room to make out with you?
 Well, passengers can be expelled from the host. We saw it happen with Matt. Gregor died, and Matt lived. All we have to do is stab her with the Traveller knife.
 Perfect! Go get it.
 Here you go. Drink.
 Too bad.
 That was exactly four ounces. When you were out killing vampires, you said one vampire kept you good for eight hours. So, our friend Caroline did a little bit of math.
 Relax, she had a calculator. So  four ounces, three times a day should be just enough to help you manage the hunger.
 So you don't rip anyone's head off. We'll deal with your crisis once we get Elena back.
 And then what? Huh? You skip town, leave it to me to tell Elena everything you did after you thought she broke up with you? No. [
 Katherine's been making a lot of excuses, and I have a feeling she won't be able to say no to me.
 It's your phone. "Elena" is calling. Answer it.
 That doesn't make any sense. She's dodged anyone's attempt to try to get her over here, and now she voluntarily wants to come over?
 Unless...
 What the hell happened?
 
 She doesn't have much time left, Katherine.
 I know that it's you, and I know that you care about Nadia. That's why I brought her here.
 You can always run, Katherine. That's what you do best. Or, you can come home and see your daughter one last time before she dies. It's your choice.
 When Gregor left Matt's body, it took him a while to wake up, too. Which gives us a little bit of time to talk about what the hell you did.
 A few hours, huh? And then what? What's the plan?
 Optimistic.
 Hey!
 Everyone's gone. The whole school cleared out for spring break. You've been in and out since you first woke up.
 Yeah... that was about three weeks ago.
 Oh yeah. You know Katherine - She's not about to go out without a grand finale.
 Look.. we shouldn't take any chances. If Damon taught us anything is that the virus makes you want to attack at the mere scent of vampire blood.
 Liv...
 She's a new witch. Bonnie's been teaching her some spells. Look, I know this is a lot to process, but just know that Caroline's out, looking for the antidote and in the mean time, we've figured out how to ration blood to keep you satiated. We're going to figure this out, okay?
 You okay?
 That's because you're starving..
 Here, uh. I got you four ounces of my blood.
 You won't be scaling any buildings, but it'll curb the cravings.
 Sorry.
 You're not fine, Elena.
 You think so?
 You're not fine, Elena.
 You'll feed until you kill. Yeah.
 What is it?
 Wait.. what do you mean "werewolf venom?" That means it's fatal.
 Or you could just bring it over here.
 Caroline.. this doesn't make any sense.. Just tell me exactly..
 I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what is going on.
 I'll see you later.
 Yeah?
 What do you mean?
 Uh.. You know, Katherine.. Staying alive wasn't enough. She wanted it all.
 Actually, we.. uh.. we kissed.
 And then, I pulled away. And I put it together. She wasn't you.
 I gotta go.
 Uh.. Oh. woah, woah, whoa. A little Warning next time please?
 I know, I'm just saying, there's a bathroom less than 10 feet away.
 What are you doing
 It's not like you saw through her.
 Oh? You think this is bad? You have no idea, do you?
 He'll tell her.
 "Hey Elena, I killed Aaron." It's not exactly casual conversation.
 So.. what's in this for you, aside from getting Damon to undo every positive decison he's ever made.
 Who are you?
 Oh yeah. How could I forget? So, you have the antidote to the ripper virus, correct?
 Alright. Fine. When will it be done?
 Okay. What do you need?
 What do you mean, there's another one of me out there?
 Special, how?
 So what? You do a locator spell until you find this guy and then you kill him?
 The last time a witch linked me to my doppelgÃ¤nger, she fried my brain and I lost my memory.
 Did you really just say that?
 It'll be fine.
 Well, if I lose my memory, then I won't remember I had anything to worry about in the first place. See? Win/win.
 Me... and I would do it for you too. Look.. let's just say that they do fry my brain.
' 'Right. And then you'll spiral out of control about killing them and then, do me a favor, remind me we were friends.
' 'No. You'll hand them over right now. I'm here.. I'm doing everything you want me to.
' 'Wait a second.. Tessa didn't need my blood when she linked me to Silas.
 He's in Atlanta.
 Hi. Rebekah? Hi.
 kidding! Lexi, right?
 Did it work?
 Did I miss something?
 You mean... kill him?
 Caroline.. I can't let you
 Alright fine. Well, I'm coming with you.
 I don't trust him..
 Atlanta Metropolitan Hospital
 I know this place. We're right outside of Mystic Falls.
 Markos, right? You said he wants our blood. Why?
 Caroline, what happened?
 No. I can't remember anything. After the spell happened, it's like I blacked out.
 Caroline, I'm here.
 6643 Peachtree Drive. There was, uh, a redheaded woman. Her name was Hazel.
 Caroline, he's a good person. Don't do it.
 Hey.
 Are you...
 It's good to see you anyway. So, do you want to tell me what happened?
 You do realize you're feeling guilty for not being able to kill someone.
 Come on, Caroline. They were never going to let me out. I'm too important to them.
 Yet another reason to hate Enzo, I guess.
 We go to sleep
 Well, the hero part of my brain needs to recharge for, you know, being tortured all day while you were out flirting with yet another British man.
 We gather our strength and wait for an opportunity to get the hell out of here â€“ together.
 Knew what?
 Not that you couldn't do it, but wouldn't do it.
 Because that's what makes you you.
 Those buckets... They're drinking my blood, and Elena's.
 This is it. Here, take my hand.
 You lose something?
 Ah. You, uh, censor your journal? Pretty sure that's against journal rules.
 I'm officially intrigued.
 I'm Stefan.
 Here you go.
 So, uh, you hated the movie, huh?
 We should, uh, do this again sometime. Yeah.
 Good.
 I'm really looking forward to dinner.
 Good night.
 Hey.
 Well, you know how sometimes you feel crazy and you call me and I tell you that you're not crazy?
 Well, I need you to tell me that I'm not crazy.
 I was walking to my car, and I nearly got plowed over in the middle of the street because I was having some vision of Elena.
 Hey.
 Yeah. Well, it's our anniversary, so, uh, no holding back.
 Mmm. Perfect.
 Oh. No, no, no. Not that drawer, not that one.
 You didn't even open it.
 I love you.
 Hey. So I, um  I got your Aunt Jenna a wine of the month thing. Think she'll like that?
 Thank you.
 Ooh. So is Damon.
 Liar.
 Hey, guys, share, please.
 Really? Nice.
 What? Everybody loves a biter.
 Good. I'll bite you right back.
 Elena.
 And then it just ended.
 Yeah. It's over.
 It was a spell, showing us what we wanted to see.
 But it still felt 
 Yeah. But, you know, the life that we had, I mean, that was amazing, too, and it wasn't a spell or a prophecy. It was real. We fell in love on our own. We had ups and downs, we fought.
 Yeah. We changed, both of us. We grew, and we grew apart, but that is real. I mean, that's life.
 And you could. Again, a fantasy. I'll always love you, Elena.
 I think you can either be friends with someone or in love with them. I don't think you can be both.
 Oh, no, no, no, no. I see what you're doing.
 Distraction tactics. Stay focused. So psychology, sociology, and anthropology share the assumption that...
 That's very good, as in verbatim, which means that I need to ask you more difficult questions.
 For what?
 You're welcome.
 Unkind. Take that back.
 So I see.
 Definitely in denial.
 Oh, no. Damon's already on that.
 Did I say Damon? What I meant to say was George.
 What are you doing here?
 Damon, your friend, uh, singular, isn't here, and we're a little busy right now. But by all means, have a seat.
 I wasn't a ripper then. I'm really sorry about your friend, but I had nothing to do with it.
 I would love to, except I have absolutely no idea who she is.
 This is ridiculous. In , I was cleaned up. I was barely feeding on people, let alone killing them.
 Election night.
 Ah. You're ok. Forget this ever happened and run.
 Who the hell are you?
 What do you know about my family?
 Why are you so obsessed with my brother?
 Ah. Why don't you do yourself a favor and stay away from my brother? He's a monster. He fell off the rails a couple of years ago. There's no talking sense into him.
 Heh. So you want me to tell you where my brother is so that you can kill him?
 Well, it's too bad you're not doing yourself any favors.
 I didn't kill her. I was just trying to scare her into leaving town.
 I have no reason to lie to you, Enzo.
 Stop!
 You're right. I killed Maggie. I tore out her throat, and I ripped her head off. I completely forgot about her until now. That's the truth. Now let her go.
 And you made it look like I did it?
 He's gonna kill her. You know that, right?
 Damon!
 He wants to hurt you in any way he can. You can't save him.
 Drink.
 You got this?
 Hey!
 I don't know. Guess I found you first.
 My brother, he sees something good in you.
 Not with your emotions off. You won't stop until you kill Damon.
 Hi. You ok?
 Bonnie here?
 Enzo's dead.
 Yeah.
 I basically just killed my brother's only friend. It's been a tough year for Damon. Don't you think it would be easier if no-humanity Enzo just left for parts unknown and was never heard from again?
 Listen, Elena. Damon thinks that Enzo left town, and we need to keep it that way. We barely just got him back. This would destroy him. Please.
 Who are you with right now?
 Because Enzo's dead, and I don't mean to put this on you, but Damon can't find out.
 Bonnie.
 I, uh, checked in on Elena. She's, uh she's all right.
 You didn't leave a note?
 You know, what happened today wasn't your fault.
 Well, either way, I think it's time you leave Enzo alone.
 Come on, Damon. He's not your responsibility.
 I think that he's not worth saving.
 Really?
 I know you guys were close.
 Even a crappy one like me?
 Damon, I know you're out a friend, but, uh, I'm not sure this guy's the best replacement.
 Enzo? Didn't he, uh, go to Cape Horn?
 Well, why are you looking for him?
 Well, maybe he hired a witch to block whatever Luke's doing. Is that possible?
 That would mean that he doesn't want to be found, so, uh, why don't you just drop it?
 That state being dead. Got it.
 And come after Elena and me today, as in now.
 Sounds great.
 Well, what did you want me to say? "No, Damon. It will be awkward to have the three of us confined to Caroline's dad's cabin because I killed your best friend and Elena's keeping that secret for me"?
 Look. I don't trust that he'd be able to hold it together.
 Either, both. I don't know. Either way 
 Hmm.
 Unpacking. We're unpacking. Uh, here you go.
 Helping Luke set up.
 You really don't think he wants to be around you?
 Who do you think brought you home last night?
 Oh, yeah. Tucked you in safely.
 Probably read you a nice, little bedtime story.
 Yeah. Well, you know, a tribe of ancient wannabe witches want to drain of us our blood and eliminate supernatural beings? I've had worse.
 Yeah, I know, but you know what? Think of all the times he's lied to you and call it a freebie.
 I'm sorry that you have to go through this.
 Elena, this is exactly what Enzo wanted. He wanted the blood to be on my hands, and I refuse to give him the satisfaction of feeling guilty about any of it.
 He's done it before. Come on. Let's get out of here.
 I'll, uh I'll make a fire.
 Uh, ok. Think. Ponder. Brain. I don't know. Uh, skull!
 All right! Skull, skull. Ok. Limb. Joint. Bone. Bone, bone. Skull and bones.
 Skull and bones! Got it! Five-zero, five-zero. Come on, guys. Zip.
 Ooh! Ok. Um, never have I ever been possessed by my evil doppelgÃ¤nger.
 Well, I'm gonna get another round. Does anybody 
 Nothing obviously because nobody's drinking.
 Oh, no. I understand the rules.
 Well, it's not exactly a relaxing getaway. Listen. Are things getting worse on the other side?
 Because something attacked Elena. Is it possible that someone over there could physically affect this plane?
 Enzo.
 Yeah. I, uh, I killed him.
 Because it's complicated.
 You guys think we could, um, talk about this some other time?
 Listen. The other side is falling apart, and I think it's allowing Enzo to mess with us.
 Where's Luke?
 You need to know why I lied to you.
 Damon, come on.
 He was your friend.
 What are you talking about?
 Hate me. I thought you would, uh, hate me.
 Yeah. Come on.
 He's barely breathing.
 I don't know.
 Oh, really? Now you're doing "I told you so"?
 Come on.
 Feeling ok?
 Yeah. Well, you didn't, and, uh, I don't understand why, but thank you.
 Well, we still need you to protect us, so why don't you get your stuff and we can get the hell out of here?
 I guess Enzo bought it.
 Bring him back. I mean, how do you plan on doing that?
 Not particularly.
 Uh, look. I know that 
 Never have I ever had a ghost try to burn me alive.
 Come on. Car's packed. We got to get out of here.
 Caroline, it's not because I didn't trust you.
 Well, if it makes you feel any better, there are things that I tell you that I don't tell her.
 Like you have dirt on your cheek. And look. Maybe I didn't want you to know that I killed Enzo.
 Because I know you, and I know you guys had that weird little chemistry thing going on.
 I didn't want you to think any less of me. I'll, uh I'll meet you over by the car when you're done.
 Who's there?
 Elena ..
 Yeah, well, you know what could have saved you the cost of this phone call? You finding us. How long have we been gone?
 Four days!? Four days and you couldn't track us down? What did you think? We were having a nice spa getaway?
 Travelers drained us of our blood, so we're having to do a little hunting.
 Believe me. She's no happier about it than I am.
 Do you want to talk to her, or are you still pretending you don't want to hear her voice?
 I have no idea where we are. We're in the middle of nowhere. Listen, we'll make our way back, but Markos drained most of all our blood - and considering the kinds of spells he was able to do with just a little bit of it..
 I'll get her home safely, all right?
 Ditto.
 No. I don't want to do that, come on. You know It's embarrassing,
 Sure
 Yeah, well.. You were delirious the first time.
 Uh.. More than we've had, that's for sure. Let me know if you see a damn buffalo.
 Yeah. More depressing than walking for miles and not knowing where the hell you're going?
 I don't know.. he had the whole "savior of the universe" voice going on.
 A sign of what?
 Our blood. Alright? Our blood. Don't hog the blame. Look, we're vampires; we're a toxic species. Whether you want to blame it on magic or biology, it's just who we are. When a human gets ravenously hungry, they eat a double cheeseburger. We kill people. And some of us are more extreme than others, but that's just who we are.
 Because I'm so much worse when I don't. I'm only going to say this once. You two are miserable without each other. So if you want to be with him, just be with him. Look, when humans want to break free from complication relationships, they go to therapy. Vampires get a pass.  Okay?
 Come on.
 Two rainbows.
 Control-freakiness never really bugged me.
 That's true. But I do know this; if Caroline Forbes were here right now, we would both be laughing.
 You've got to be kidding me!
 Alright. Let's cut to the chase
 You're giving us a ride.
 Won't they kill you for helping us out?
 She's not my girlfriend.
 Something like that...
 We're not just going to let you take Tyler.
 Look out!
 Get out of the car!
 Unlock the doors!!
 Elena!
 Let's get inside! Run! Now.
 The whole town's square is filled with travelers. We've gotta get out of here.
 The spell unravels the witch magic. It's spreading and without the magic, I'm just someone who was shot by his dad.
 That's a tomorrow problem. Right now, we've just got to outrun the spell, regroup in about a thousand miles and figure out a game-plan)
 Jeremy, head back with Matt. We need eyes and ears in Mystic Falls. You guys take Jeremy's car. I'm going to wait here for Caroline and Bonnie.
 I'm going to find out what's taking so long.
 Uh, yeah, she did.
 Listen, uh, you're not going to see Maria again.
 She's dead.. I'm sorry.
 I wasn't the one that killed her. The witches did.
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoa. I'm in no mood to fight tonight, all right?
 Listen, we're going to find a way to stop this spell and even if Mystic Falls is gone, we're going to find a way to save ourselves, all right?
 Bonnie...
 Please tell me that you've figured out a way to bring us all back.
 You seem very intent on finding somebody you barely know.
 We'll find him.
 Hmm.
 I was attacked by Silas and locked in a safe to drown for three months.
 Lexi, either one of us could blink out of existence any second, so if you have something to say to meâ€”
 What about Caroline?
 See what?
 She's trying to gather the Travelers. They're planning something.
 Where the hell is Alaric?
 Well, why didn't you? I mean, if anyone was going to find peace, it should be you.
 All right. Let's make a deal. If all this fails and you and I are stuck over here, we're not going to let whatever's happening to all these people happen to us. We're going to find peace together.
 Oh, shut it.
 No! We need to go together. Damon isn't here yet.
 No.
 You go. I'll wait here.
 This place is falling apart.
 No. No. No.
 I was just trying...
 She fell. I was just tryingâ€”
 Damon. He's not there yet.
 I lost them both.. Two people I've known longest in this world... both gone.
 She never came out. Neither did Markos. I know that's not a conicidence. It was, uh, her, unfinished buisness. And Damonâ€”uhâ€”he finally had everything he wanted. He was happy. He should be here.
 Hey, Dean. I think a zero might've fallen off my paycheck.
 For what?
 Dan's wife put a ding on the hood of his Shelby.
 You're ripping me off, Dean.
 Hello?
 Still working on it.
 Knock yourself out.
 Uh, yeah, I would, but, um, I told Dean I'd stop by the garage later.
 Hey, look, no offense, Ivy, but, uh, you're the one who showed up to me today.
 I get weird?
 Well, I already know everything about you. You're from Colorado. You love dogs. Your dad's a bit of a pain in the ass, but you graciously let him pay your rent.
 I'm a vampire.
 Hey. And I like you.
 Hello?
 Elena, hey. What's going on?
 Not yet.
 There's no right or wrong way, Elena.
 I can't. I gave up.
 I did. And then I realized it was pointless and that I needed to move on with my life, so... I stopped.
 I mean I said good-bye, Elena. I moved on. Damon is gone. It's time for you to say good-bye, too.
 Hey.
 Uh, what are you doing?
 No, no. I just I wasn't really expecting you to...still be here. That's all.
 No, no, Ivy. I was just 
 Ivy, look why don't we...have dinner tonight. Although I should probably do the cooking.
 Hey.
 Perfect timing, I was just uh 
 What? Where?
 Uh, Ivy's car was in the shop, where I work.
 Not anymore.
 Yeah, I guess I have.
 Right. Well, I've moved on from that job.
 How 'bout we just drop it? I'm happy doing what I'm doing now, and that's all that should really matter, right?
 You don't know what you're talking about.
 You should probably get him out of here. He'll be up soon and I really don't feel like another go-around.
 It's fine, Caroline. I really don't care.
 Cause I had to. I had to 'move on'. You know, the months before I moved here I was following every lead that Alaric sent my way. I spoke to every witch, every shaman, every psychic in 20 countries around the globe, and every lead was a dead end.
 The Gemini Coven, yeah I looked into them too, Caroline there was nothing there. Because there's nothing we can do, Damon and Bonnie are DEAD. I had to come to terms with that. And once I did, I had to start over, I couldn't just live my life with my old friends, I couldn't just go near Mystic Falls or Elena or 
 I had to move on I didn't have a choice. I had to erase everything.
 Oh, you know my friend he's a...a bad drunk.
 No! (Stefan superspeeds toward Enzo but Enzo throws him back onto the ground, and slowly approaches him.)
 Yeah, well I'm not here to work. Need a few days off.
 Yeah, well I'm not here to work. Need a few days off.
 I said, I need a few days off.
 You hired a vampire, next time do a background check.
 Now, shut up and don't move. You have no idea how long I wanted to do that. See, I was trying to...get a fresh start, live a normal life, normal job, normal dick of a boss. That's you by the way, and this place was supposed to be my sanctuary. And it was until yesterday.
 Thanks buddy, I will. Now, I need you to drive my car into the woods, and you're going to bury my girlfriend. And forget this ever happened. Oh, and when I get back you're giving me a raise.
 I know. That's why I'm here. I wanted to stop by and say hi.
 This hospital thing..Its a whole new look huh??
 You seem different. Seem happier.
 Ohh..About the dinner party from Hell.
 No i've been working on the healing thing too. I guess. Hey, by the way, have you heard from Caroline? She's not returning any of my calls and i..i really wanna apologize for the way i acted.
 No..no I'm not sure i'm ready to dive back into all that. No pun intended. (Elena smiles)
 Will Enzo be there?
 No.No. Don't worry about it. Yeah. Maybe i'll stop by.
 Never gives up on her friends.
 Pretty much.
 Not anymore.
 Time flies.
 Hey. It's Stefan. Leave a message.
 Yeah. Well, you'll be dead, so I think she'll let you off the hook.
 No, thanks.
 So you can give me a lifetime full of misery. Well, that's fine. I'm just gonna shorten the lifetime.
 Why don't you ask him?
 But what? What? I was fooling myself, I was using her as an escape? Yeah, I know what
 No, but it will stop him from reminding me of my brother. I kill him, I can leave this place, and I can start over again.
 Yep.
 Found this on one of your guys. I think he killed him though.
 Stefan Salvatore. You and I have something in common.
 Just make sure it's painful.
 Give me one good reason why.
 Oh, I heard your message. I also heard you sent Lexi some flowers, seventeen years after you left her to burn to death on a rooftop.
 Damon, this is, uh, Zach Salvatore. He owns the house now, he knows the family history, and I told him if you got out of line, I'd take care of you myself.
 Oh, I don't. Otherwise, I wouldn't allow this.
 You ready to start over?
 Hello. Any sign of our runaway girl?
 She's not on any of the roads, which means she's probably in Mystic Falls.
 Listen, I gotta go. I'll, uh, talk to you later.
 Uh, I'm going home.
 No, it was my home. But, I can no longer enter its borders, therefore I have a new home.
 Look, my fake new life ended when Enzo decided to kill my not-so-fake girlfriend, Ivy. So, I am going to go home, pack up and start over. Again.
 You'd be surprised how easy it is to forget the past, Elena.
 You do not have to worry about me. It's not like I haven't done this before, I have a system.
 Sure.
 And what about our runaway girl, Sarah?
 Suure.
 Mmmm..
 It's good, right?
 Oh, yeah. I can't remember if that squirrel was roadkill, or one I caught in the rat trap.
 Better hope it was roadkill, though, because the rat trap was full of rat droppings.
 Swish your tongue around. Does it feel like hair, or is it more of a grainy pellet?
 She's on vervain. So is Zach, which means hands off.
 Was cute.
 Me too. But, what's done is done. So, after taxes, and Social Security, and health insurance, I'm left with 206 dollars and three cents to spend for the week. Do you wanna get drunk? (He holds up his paycheck)
 Yeah. Point is to start over. Pretend to be as human as possible.
 You got me there. Damon isn't around calling it granny-mobile, so...
 ...That's one way to put it.
 We haven't even gone for the fun part.
 No. Deciding who you wanna be for the next thirty years. You wanna be an astronaut? You wanna be an Olympic athlete? You wanna skip med school? Boom, you're a doctor! Go ahead, challenge me. I'll show you how it's done.
 Okay.
 Well, if she does out you, then you start your life over somewhere else. Free of all the supernatural drama.
 So, you're ready to see the system in action?
 Alright. Hand over your ring.
 Your ring.
 Elena Williams...
 We've known each other for a very long time now. And, you've always been my best friend. I have always loved you. And, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. Will youâ€”Elena  Wait! You're not just proposing to me because I'm pregnant, are you?
 No. No, I-I'm proposing to you because you are my rock, okay? You have stood by my side through the multiple rehabs, the jail time, the bull-fighting injury? I mean, you have brought me back from the edge! And, sweetheart, this baby is the best thing that ever happened to us. Will you marry me?
 Thank you all so much!
 Sure.
 Hey, what happened to your wrist?
 Damon? What did you do to Gail?
 How the hell did you feed on Gail? She's on vervain.
 These people are my friends. Zach is family. They trust me.
 So, here's what I don't get, Damon. Why'd you insinuate yourself back into my life and then cheat, and lie, and break all the rules?
 You get your daylight ring back when you decide to behave. Now, answer my question  Why did you come back here?
 Oh, congrats. Now what?
 Yeah, I can imagine a road trip with you. I can imagine you feeding on innocent people and, uh, leaving a trail of bodies behind. I can imagine you making me drink human blood, and laughing at me while I suffer.
 Just looking at the facts, Damon. 1912, you convinced me to drink human blood again, which is why I became a Ripper. In 1942, you almost pushed me off the rails again because you were so damn needy. 1977, you left my best friend to die after I sent her to come help you. And now, I'm finally happy. I have a new life, I'm doing well, and, uh, you just can't handle that, can you, Damon?
 You don't have to try, Damon. All you have to do is exist. Because no matter what I do or where I go, you will be with me forever, trying to destroy every single thing that I've built. I don't know why I thought this time would be any different. I wanted it to be different. You just keep failing.
 That's a NO on the road trip.
 Probably out killing someone else's girlfriend.
 Uh-uh! Pregnant, remember?
 No, but you'll have to reinvent yourself in thirty years. If you don't, people will start asking why you're not getting any older.
 You said it yourself  I met you. You know, since 1864, I have been a carpenter, an ambulance driver, migrant worker, high school student...
 No reason.
 It's a little weird to, uh, hear you refer to Damon as just my brother?
 I don't even know anymore.
 You know, it's, uh ... it's not important. Things change, right? To change.
 Elena, I'm avoiding Mystic Falls, not you. We can talk, we can visit. And, if you ever need a car repair, I will give you the parts at cost.
 Bye.
 Hey, man. Noticed you weren't celebrating my engagement. How come?
 Oh, right, right, right, okay. Hey, remind me, which guy was it? Broken nose or fractured arm? I was kinda drunk. Still waiting for the congrats on my engagement. I'm really happy for you.
 Is that all you got? Come on, man! Come on!
 I'm never gonna be rid of you, am I?
 I thought you agreed to leave.
 I told you, I have a system.
 You are the last person who should be lecturing me on coping mechanisms.
 Yeah? All by yourself?
 I'm sorry that I can't just forget him like you, Elena.
 You are. You erased him.
 You had Alaric compel you to forget every good thing that Damon ever did. You made him a monster in your own mind because you couldn't handle the grief of losing him.
 Because you were in love with him, and he was in love with you. And when Damon died, a part of you died, too.
 Believe me, I asked myself that for a very long time. And eventually, I saw it. Damon inspired you. He pushed you to own the darkest parts of yourself. And, when you died, he was the only one that could made you feel alive again. And you made him feel human. You loved Damon for the same reasons that I love Damon. Because in spite of every single thing that he did, we couldn't live without him. And now, you don't have to, but I do. So, I'm gonna do it my way. You do it yours.
 Hello?
 Ivy.
 Hello?
 Enzo? I-I thought, thought you were supposed to kill him.
 So, what has he told you?
 Well that's um, good to hear.
 Thanks for the, uh, heads up.
 Absolutely.
 Ivy?
 You redecorated.
 Yeah, I know the feeling.
 I'm trying to help you.
 Listen, I have to get you out of Savannah.
 Ivy, calm down, when you are a vampire your emotions are heightened.
 Ivy, please.
 I need a favor. (He drops it on the floor.)
 Hang on.
 Uh, Enzo turned her.
 Right. So, I need a little bit of help.
 Just watch her for a little while, while I get Luke to make her a daylight ring.
 Show her the ropes, teach her some control.
 A mess that wouldn't have happened if you had just left me alone.Ivy, behind  Caroline  Um, I can hear you, you know? I can hear everything, like, perfectly.
 He's not here. He's in Savannah, which is why we're not.Ivy, plopping on Caroline's bed  You know the real tragedy in all this? I read "he's just not that into you," and 
 Look, Tripp Cooke has somehow decided to become the eastern seaboard's self-proclaimed vampire hunter. None of us are safe, if we can't control ourselves. If anybody can teach her, it's you.
 I don't know, you tell me.
 Grading on the curve, huh?
 No, I just... came here to get one of these from Luke.
 Enzo turned a vampire when he and Caroline found me.
 Her name is Ivy. I was hoping you can compel her to get a handle on things, get somewhere far away from me, live a good life.
 I'm just asking you to give her a fresh start.
 Well it was when you compelled Elena to forget about Damon.
 He was my brother.
 You lost her?
 I got caught up.
 Driving halfway out of town.
 I slid Ivy's daylight right under 
 your front door 
 I'm someone who's trying to start over, and then suddenly you and Enzo show up and now I have hunters on my trail and a brand new vampire who wants to kill me and everyone else in her path! And that's not how someone starts over, Caroline!
 Ahh.
 Yep... This is happening. I'm gonna talk out loud to a... a crypt filled with my dead family.
 Everyone but you, Damon. Because wherever you are, it's not here.
 I gotta say... I'm not doing so great without you. I keep trying to start over, but... I can't get anywhere. Because I'm lost, brother. I'm lost.
 Damon?
 How am I seeing you right now?
 I can't believe it. I thought you were gone.
 What are we going to tell people?
 Mystic Falls? 1994?
 So, how did you get back?
 ...She had Alaric do it.
 He didn't. I turned him in.
 You seriously jumped out of a window? What if somebody saw you?
 Look. He's been trapped over there alone for months. He just wants to see you.
 Well, they won't. But even if they did, is that such a bad thing?
 Oh, please forget that you told me that. And definitely do not tell Damon that.
 I was gonna say because he'll be heartbroken. Listen, what do you want to do? I mean, you have to see him eventually.
 Look, Enzo wasn't being careful. Tripp would've caught him eventually, and that meant danger for all of us.
 Well, I thought Tripp was gonna kill him. I didn't think he was going to keep him alive for information.
 What?
 Hold on a second! Enzo turns Ivy, right? A hunter kills her, and yet I'm the bad guy? I'm not the one threatening to turn in other vampires to save his own skin.
 Yeah. Damon is my brother, and I gave up on him first. Enzo didn't, so if rescuing his idiot friend is gonna somehow make it up to him, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
 Pretty much is.
 That's him.
 He thinks I'm on his side
 Damon and Alaric are across the border. I got to go
 Agh! Ugh! Agh! Ah!
 Get up! Come on, get up!
 I know. I'm sorry
 You've gotta understand how hard it was for her.
 At least you knew you had a home to come back to. She didn't have anything. To her, you were just gone.
 You done?
 Good. Now, quit stalling. There's a girl you need to go see.
 You're not going to find out just sitting there, are you?
 Hey.
 Could we just get past this, please?
 Look, Caroline. What do you want me to do, huh? Stop making me guess and tell me so we can go back to being friends again.
 Come on, Enzo. Ask him what you want to know. Let's get this over with.
 Take two hours, get the names of his men and what they know. After that, he's a liability. Get rid of him.
 What's weird?
 Hey, Caroline. Look. You're not safe. Tripp's men still have your name.
 Well, don't worry. We're almost there.
 Knock it off. Her mother's life is on the line.
 Well, I didn't restrain him.
 I'm sorry. Are you still talking?
 Mm-hmm.
 They're here.
 Wasn't me. Enzo must have turned him into a vampire before we got there.
 Yeah. Anyway, you want to help me fix that?
 Right.
 You heard that?
 Only when you listen.
 Why?
 Why do you have a thing for me?
 Ok. Um... Why did you have a thing for me?
 Look, Caroline, please just talk to me. Tell me how, tell me why. Please just make me understand how it is that I missed it.
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not seeing it, I'm sorry for not...
 No. I didn't say that. I... I... Look. I don't know what I felt. You know, my head was all over the place, but I am incredibly sorry for the way that I treated you.
 But you do still hate me.
 Hey. Were you invited to Friends-giving?
 Huh.
 Nope.
 Alaric, you might want to keep the news to yourself. I tracked this lead months ago. It was a dead end.
 Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're both finding amusement in this.
 Because I don't think about her that way. She's my friend.
 Organizational skills?
 Oh! Look. We're here. Behold the Gemini Coven exactly how it looked 4 months ago.
 Like I said, uh, 3,000 miles ago, it's not here. Can we, uh, go home now, please?
 Hilarious. Keep them coming.
 Give me this.
 Anybody want to take a stab at how Bonnie's Teddy bear undid whatever was cloaking this place?
 Why would Bonnie put her magic in Ms. Cuddles?
 Wait. Jo is his sister?
 What the hell just happened?
 Oop. Careful. You just sounded genuinely concerned for my brother.
 He didn't. It's some sort of cloaking spell. Alaric's on the phone with Jo trying to figure out how to break it.
 So just to be clear, Jo was invited to Friends-giving, but I wasn't.
 Huh.
 You're just mad because no one knew how to carve the turkey.
 Trust you with what?
 That's easy. I was in love with you. I wanted you to know everything. 
 Well, that's gonna be problem because even if we could see the house I haven't been invited in.
 Yeah, I see it.
 What the hell are we gonna do with a knife?
 Well, I guess the, uh, disappearing act's their shtick.
 And we learned that the Ascendant, i.e. the only reason we flew our asses out here in the first place, is actually with Jo at Whitmore, 5 minutes from where we started. Great.
 Nice, Damon.
 What are you doing?
 Hey.
 You made me a doggie bag.
 Caroline, um, look. When Damon was gone, I, um... I pushed you away.
 But I pushed you away the most. I knew that you were the one person who would sit with me and let me cry, and I didn't want to cry anymore, so I had to push you away the most.
 Listenâ€”
 You didn't compel him to get her drunk.
 You realize he is gonna kill you when he finds out what you did to him.
 I didn't ruin my 
 You done?
 Yeah, great. So, uh, when's this grand theft gonna happen?
 Hey. I really wouldn't do that if I were you. You hurt him, and, uh, I hurt you, and really don't feel like cleaning up two corpses today.
 What are you talking about?
 Yeah. You seem like the type that would do better on your own. Hey. Do you want a drink?
 Hey. Excuse me. Can we get two chocolate milk shakes, please? It's a, uh, Salvatore family tradition.
 All right. Listen. In 10 seconds, you're gonna get up and walk out of here with me, smiling, acting like nothing's wrong. The acting part shouldn't be too hard for you.
 I know you're lying.
 Ready to go?
 Oh, just a little family drive.
 Ah. That's your big evidence, a picture you stole? You gave yourself up the second you got in the car.
 Because right now, Sarah Salvatore is in her dorm room at Duke university, where she studies as an art major, and she didn't bounce from group home to group home. She was adopted right out of the hospital by a great family. I made sure of it.
 She's my family. Even though she doesn't know me, I've looked out for her for her entire life. Now who the hell are you?
 You decided to find them for her.
 Well, considering the fact that my brother killed her mom while she was pregnant, I don't know about that. I let him believe that the baby died. I wanted to protect her. Even though my brother's not the same person he was before, it's safer if he doesn't know. I know that may be a little bit extreme, but I want her to have a normal life no matter what. See, the problem is with you around, there's a threat now, someone who knows her other than me.
 I'm not gonna hurt you. I just need you to take off your Vervain.
 You've never met or heard of Sarah Salvatore. Forget everything that happened here, leave Virginia, and never come back.
 She's not my family, she's a con artist, and I'm just trying to get rid of her. Get out of here.
 I told you she's a con artist. There is no Sarah Salvatore. That baby died when Damon killed her mom.
 Come on. Don't do this. Just let her go.
 Don't be stupid. Don't be stupid.
 Look. I'm sorry that Enzo killed her. He's 
 What, you think that was easy for me, watching an innocent girl die?
 Matt, I promise you that everything I do I have thought out over and over, making sure it's the right thing to do.
 No. You're supposed to trust that I'm nothing like Enzo.
 Hey. I, uh, didn't know which ones to get, so I got both.
 Your mom needed Christmas lights.
 Here. I got it.
 Well, your mom asked for my help.
 Caroline, I'm trying, ok?
 I was just leaving.
 That doctor just came over from radiology. I overheard her say "glioblastoma."
 We brought her in a couple of weeks ago after Tripp's guys grabbed here. Doctors ran some tests, and apparently they found something suspicious.
 Or maybe her mom hasn't told her yet.
 There's a 22-year-old sociopathic witch running around Mystic Falls right now. That we have a plan for. We've dealt with every kind of evil there is, and we always have a plan, but this... If Caroline loses her mom, it'll destroy her.
 She doesn't deserve this, Elena. She's a good person. She's happy, she's kind.
 Let me do it.
 Let Damon know. I should tell Caroline. I haven't been there for her. Caroline needed me, and I ran away. So... yeah, I have to do it.
 Hey.
 Caroline... We need to talk.
 We were worried, so... Elena compelled one of the doctors for information.
 Caroline, do you think that if our blood cured cancer we would have heard about that by now?
 That's the problem. They can't.
 The tumor is growing so fast the doctors don't think that will work.
 Yeah? Well, you weren't around to annoy me for the last 4 months, so I had a bit of extra time on my hands.
 Think of it as a early merry Christmas/late welcome back to life present.
 Hey. Just, uh, do me a favor. Don't die again. Those fenders were a real bitch to find.
 Yep.
 Well, that depends. Might have to kill Jeremy if I find out that he slept in my bed.
 Oh. Because that's the first thing I wanna see in the morning.
 Yeah. Hey, any chance you could help me out with some speakers at Caroline's Thanks for the coffee.
 Damon's room. Upstairs, end of the hall. What are you doing in my house?
 Oh.
 Well, I don't know. But the Smithsonian would. You should call them.
 And, what exactly are we watching?
 And this regimen has to happen in my living room...why?
 Well, that's new. And where the hell is he?
 Hey.
 Yeah, I hooked up the surround sound to your DVD player and I left a universal remote on the table, right there.
 Actually, no, I haven't. One of the few perks of starting over ever few decades, real life never really catches up to you.
 Opinions vary. Wait, why? Are you leaving?
 Duke? You know what, maybe I'll give you a ride. I was thinking of heading that way to check on a friend.
 Mmmhm.
 Well, it's a student exhibition.
 You know what? I'm gonna catch up.
 Okay. Excuse me. Can you point me to Sarah Nelson's exhibit?
 Thank you.
 What are you doing here?
 So, I'm guessing you came here to make a demand?
 Why do you care?
 Don't do that.
 What do you want me to tell you, Enzo? That the girl's my relative? Fine. She is Zach Salvatore's daughter, which makes her my great-niece 4 generations removed. I took her mother's body to the ER after Damon killed her. They did a C-section to save Sarah's life, but I kept that little detail from Damon so that she could live a good life in a nice home, where she felt safe and loved. That's my big secret.
 You wanna tell Damon that I've been lying to him for the past eighteen years? Go ahead, be my guest. Maybe he'll hate me or maybe he'll realize it was the best thing I could have done for everyone. But either way, once you tell him, you'll have nothing left to obsess about.
 Hi.
 Yeah, I got into a bidding war over a piece of art. (Enzo laughs)
 What kind of experiment?
 It seems too easy.
 Okay, then why have I never heard of our blood curing cancer before?
 Look, I want this to work, okay? I do 
 Well, I can see that you believe it.
 Okay. Let's go home.
 Come on. (they walk away)
 I tell you this secret I've been keeping for 18 years, and that's what you're worried about?
 Hey, so, I know it goes without saying, but I would appreciate it it 
 Thank you.
 Hey.
 What happened?
 Yeah? Well, clearly, he's not fine now. Wait. I thought you compelled him to forget everything after you fed him your blood. How did he find you?
 What if this blood isn't even his? Is there any chance that your mom signed the house over to you?
 He's a vampire, which means after you fed him your blood...
 I need help.
 So the blood didn't heal him, it sped up his cancer and killed him.
 Hey.
 No, not yet. It's a little outside of Jo's expertise.
 Yeah, I was there when it healed Colin.
 Caroline had every reason to think it would work.
 So that makes me an expert in supernatural cancer-treatment..
 Because you were thinking so rationally when Damon died. Right? Her mother is terminal. You didn't see the hope in her eyes when she thought that maybe her mother didn't have to die. And I didn't wanna be the one to take that away from her.
 Hi.
 Sure you don't need some real food? There's probably a machine around here that vends O-positive.
 You were trying to help.
 Listen, you are an optimist. You wanna believe that anything is possible and that is exactly what your mom needs to hear right now. Okay?
 Hey, hey. Calm down, calm down. It's okay. It's okay.
 That's enough, Damon.
 I wasn't.
 I was actually thinking that you have far more important things to do than plan a memorial service for your mother. Who's still alive, by the way.
 Caroline, you took a risk. It didn't pay off, but you did it out of love. You made your mother sicker, okay? But what are you gonna do now? Are you just gonna bury your head in the sand?
 You don't have to say anything to her. Just sit with her.
 Look, when I was young, my mom, she got really sick. And instead of spending time with her, I did everything I could to avoid her. Like picking out her favorite flowers or walking into town to get the tea that she liked. And I pretended like I was doing it for her, but I wasn't. I was just afraid to see her like that. And then my dad, he uh, he sent her away and she died. I would give anything to have one more day with her.
 She doesn't think there's anything to forgive. She just wants you to be with her.
 Hey.
 I guess someone fixed the coffee machine. (gives Caroline the coffee)
 Must be some other option.
 Okay.
 I promise.
 Hmm.
 Well, that's the bear Bonnie
 Well, I'm pretty sure that
 You're gonna what?
 Wait, wait. Hold on.
 Right.
 Nah. I'm not big on digging.
 Yeah, but I don't dig them
 Ooh.
 I should probably stay, keep
 Hey. Is that an
 Right there.
 Well, we are in the middle
 (pulls it out of her reach)
 Jerk, huh?
 Oh, you sound angry.
 Definitely angry.
 Well, you should be. Your
 That make you feel better?
 Try again.
 That's good. Get it out.
 Well, you started it. Felt
 All right. Wait a minute.
 No, no, no. I'm serious. Is
 I'm sure we can clean her
 Hey.
 Do you think you packed enough?
 "The anthology of Shakespeare," volumes one through 12.
 Oh, hey, do you mind just... Do you mind getting that?
 Yeah. It's ok.
 You know, if you're gonna go for a spin, I suggest you get your helmet.
 Oh, they have lights. I don't blame you.
 Oh, the box was loose, so I figured I would fix it.
 Well, actually, you could've had some serious problems... Exposed wires, electrical fires.
 I don't.
 Hey, so you brought an entire crate of these. Any idea where I should store them?
 You ok?
 Caroline, let me deal with the books.
 I have probably read every single one of these. I'm happy to take the responsibility.
 Thought that was for your mom.
 Hmm, well, they're gonna have a lot of catching up to do. So, I realize it doesn't matter.
 It doesn't matter what book your mom reads in her final precious moments. It doesn't matter if it's good or if it's terrible. It doesn't matter because life isn't about your final moments. It's about the moments that led up to them. (Music playing)
 Control? Hey, look. If anyone can control death... It's you.
 Caroline, that's not what...
 I'm not here because your mom asked me to look after you.
 Well, because you're my friend, because I know what it feels like to lose a mother, and because when you told me you hated me, that was pretty much the worst thing I had heard in a long time.
 Go for it.
 Tyler, hey, it's Stefan. You might want to head back to Mystic Falls. Caroline's mom isn't doing too hot. I'll call you with updates. What'd the doctors say?
 How much longer?
 You didn't know.
 Caroline...
 You still can.
 Try to clear your mind.
 Think about your favorite memory of your mom.
 It's ok. It's ok. Just relax. Close your eyes. Open up your mind. We're gonna live in her memories.
 Just take her hand.
 It's working.
 Borrowing one of father's ties for the funeral.
 Did you finish the speech?
 It's an important speech.
 Father said we're not to cry.
 I don't think I will.
 Because mother's angel told me everything would be alright.
 Last night in my sleep. She visited me. Did she visit you?
 Well, I see the eulogy is coming along swimmingly.
 Listen. I need your advice, and I need you to not be a dick about it because I have no one else to ask.
 What did I just say? All right, look. Something happened between Caroline and me.
 And then her mom died, and I haven't had a chance to talk to her about it, and I don't know the best way to handle it.
 What?
 Yeah, but I didn't even-
 You missed your speech.
 Why?
 You could have just said goodbye.
 Caroline? Doing alright?
 Sure you're doing okay?
 Caroline, I, um... I-I want to talk to you about all this. I do, but, maybe when we're alone and you've had a chance to get through the day.
 Hey, hey. We'll talk when all this is over. (leaves the room)
 Nice speech.
 What broke through the writer's block?
 I think you were wrong about Caroline. I realized that I may not be able to explain what I feel for her, but it is something. And yeah, maybe all love isn't true love in the messed up way that you and I have experienced it but, I think this could turn into something even better.
 Caroline? Sorry to barge in. Door was unlocked. Caroline! Caroline!
 Totally empty, Caroline took everything but the damn doors off the hinges.
 This is coming from the girl that burned her house down.
 
 
 Alright. I will.
 
 Damon, if she kills somebody, I 
 Just do me a favor. Check around Mystic Falls, see if anybody's missing?
 Hey. 
 Good. 
 
 Was there any... biting involved?
 No. I meant, did she bite you?
 
 What party?
 Hey. Uh, listen. I never thought I would ask this, but, um... Do you want to go to a rave?
 No, which means she must have given him her blood.
 He remembers them making out  in graphic detail  but that's about it.
 No, it's not good. It means that she's gonna use him as a human blood bag every time she gets hungry.
 Wait a minute. Why are you defending her?
 And then what? She magically flips her humanity switch and starts feeling everything that she's been putting off? Caroline is going to snap, and when she does, it's gonna be my fault. Because I am the reason that she did this.
 Her mother died, her world was turning upside down, and she asked me one simple question. All I had to do was tell her the truth, and I didn't. Now, look me in the eye and tell me that I couldn't have stopped this.
 
 
 I'm not here to babysit you, Caroline.
 You're right. I was. And then, when I came to apologize and tell you how I really felt, you were gone.
 But I do, so let me tell you how I really feel.
 
 I don't know when it became more than friendship, but it did, and it scared me, so I-I pushed it away, but here we are.
 That's good. Anger. That means you want to feel.
 Hey, hey. 
 Hey. It worked.
 I saw it in her eyes. She's still in there. We just have to find her.
 Then we find her, we lock her up, and I push until I break through. I can get her back, Elena.
 
 What are you doing with Enzo's phone?
 
 Where is she, Caroline?
 Look, Caroline. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pushed you.
 Look at me, Caroline. What do you want me to do? You want me to leave town, I'll leave town. I'll stay as far away from you as possible. Just please let her go.
 Killing Sarah isn't gonna change that.
 It's not gonna happen, Caroline.
 Hey, Liam  remember that conversation we had earlier about being honest? Where are you?
 
 She's gonna let her die, Elena.
 
 
 Hello?
 Oh, really?
 Well, I will be in one second. 
 
 Oh, you know, loud, lame, rave-like.
 Where do we keep our weapons?
 Crossbows, vervain grenades, all that hunter crap Jeremy was into? Ah! Yes! The throne.
 Elena told on me. Shocker.
 Do yourself a favor. Stay out of my way today.
 Moving. Truly. Although it did lack a certain, um, authenticity.
 And you are a vampire without humanity, singing about heartbreak.
 It sure is, Caroline. Especially this carefully crafted good student routine, straight and narrow, anything to keep you from making a mistake you might regret one year from now when you flip your switch back on. Oh, except the whole ruining my life part.
 No, no, no. See, that's where you're wrong. Because, like you, I'm prone to doing bad things when my humanity is off, but unlike you, I don't have an elaborate system to keep me in check.
 Well, I'm making it your problem. If my life is gonna fall apart when my humanity starts flooding back, then so is yours. When I'm done with you, you'll be drowning in mistakes.
 Yes, it is. And this? forcing you to let go, one day at a time, until you break.
 Seriously?
 Oh, come on. It was easy for you, Caroline. All you had to do was shed some tears about your mom's funeral, play the cancer card, and boom   your precious routine is back on track. Am I wrong?
 Neat, organized Caroline. Staying within the lines. Good at control, terrible at revenge.
 I tore your director's head off with my teeth. Oh, my God. Caroline, literally just unbolted this damn thing? I mean, it's gonna take me, what, ten minutes to put this back together? You are an embarrassment to humanity-free vampires everywhere.
 Uh, I brought you a little peace-offering. I figured with all that singing, and furnace-stuffing, you must be parched.
 Now, see, this is how a vampire with no humanity is supposed to act! I am inflicting actual pain!
 Why? You thinking about giving in? Letting go? Breaking your code?
 Come on, Caroline! Just let go! I promise it'll feel good.
 Okay! Then I'll end it.
 AHHH! AHHHH!
 Second lesson in losing control  No. Saving. Strangers.
 Shhh. Shhh.
 Aw, Damon must be up to something really good if he sent the B-team. What do you say we send them a little message?
 Stopping you from leaving the cleaning staff two dead bodies. Not to mention, killing Elena's former guardian and your brother's best friend. Did you like being locked up and tortured to get your humanity back?
 Just be done with them.
 Fine. If that's what you want.
 You think I don't know everything about you? I taught you how to control your bloodlust, remember? Stay still, and don't scream.
 The thing that you keep resisting.
 I don't have to try  deep down, you and I are exactly the same, Caroline. Come on, you can break routine for a second, right? She has a really pretty neck.
 See? Control is overrated.
 It's... next to the girl we left bleeding out in the hallway.
 Boo!
 Boo!
 
 Well, Caroline and I had a little bet that she would scare you to death.
 But, you have to understand  this is her first time messing with somebody, so she didn't realize the whole "dead body shock-drop"-thing is a complete clichÃ©.
 
 
 
 
 Someone ask for the manager?
 Oh, look! It's the police officers in training. Are you guys here to arrest us? 
 I'm just enjoying the music. You guys want next song?
 No, stay! Caroline's taking requests.
 Well, looks like, uh, Whitmore's gonna need a new philosophy TA. 
 Sounds good to me.
 Oooh! Looks like somebody's angry.
 
 No, actually, I'm just not used to people being this stupid.
 Hey, Caroline? I will gladly kill him for you, but I know what a jerk he was during your relationship, so if you want...
 Ooh, that's a very good question. I mean, if all that rage made you think that you could take us both, maybe this is Nature's way of reconnecting you with your true self?
 It's my mother.
 I had a mom. She died. So, whoever this is is Damon's lame attempt to get my humanity back on.
 Ugh!
 
 
 How'd you find her?
 
 Adorable.
 What kind of mother doesn't love her own children?
 First step...
 ...Convince her that my humanity is still off. I'll tell her that my run-in with our mother had no effect on me, and I want to keep the party going.
 Torture her until she breaks.
 Well, she's not gonna find out this time.
 I'm hungry, so I figure we can eat whoever brings them up.
 Damon... Shut up!
 Nothing.
 It's not exactly how I wanted things to go down, but I can't change it now, so can we just drop it?
 We drain her of her blood, make her weak, and then bombard her with everything she used to care about  memories of who she was, her friendships, her mom. Did you bring it?
 It could work.
 I'm not gonna let that happen.
 Just making us some drinks.
 Mmmm...
 Let's just get it over with.
 Yeah?
 We got caught.
 Because I already tried. You're wasting your energy.
 They're drying us out. First they drain our blood, then they starve us.
 Ah-ah. I wouldn't do that if I were you.
 You do realize that vodka to a desiccating vampire is like salt water to a human?
 I think it was after.
 Does this look real to you?
 What?
 Well, maybe I should read it first.
 I mean, what happens if eventually you get your humanity back and you hate me for destroying the last think your mom wanted to say to you?
 Sorry, Elena,
 But, if you want us back, you're gonna have to try a lot harder than that.
 They'll make a mistake eventually. And, when they do, we will pounce and drain the first person we can get our teeth on.
 I thought your veins felt like sandpaper.
 Tell me about it.
 No. It was just hard to get a word in, that's all.
 I'm good. Thank you.
 I said I'm good.
 Caroline...
 Heh. What are you talking about?
 You must be having heatstroke.
 Please. Stop.
 It's working. The pain you're feeling, let it in.
 You need to come back now, Caroline.
 I want to show you something. Just take my hand.
 I can help you if you let me. Just please, take my hand. Please, Caroline.
 Agh! Caroline, please stop.
 Well, Caroline and I spent the entire day digging in the woods to find a teddy bear, and now she wants to repair it. She's very task-oriented.
 It...It's a memory, a real one.
 Thank you. You, uh, should have seen the look on Caroline's face when that bear fell apart.
 Well, I don't think the timing is right for me and Caroline right now, with everything going on.
 No, I just mean if I'm gonna start something with Caroline, I want it to be perfect... No loss, no pain, no grief.
 I'm a patient guy. Hey. Do you want me to mail that out for you?
 You're a good mom.
 ...I can't.
 I already gave you the letter.
 Whatever it was, it's gone.
 It's okay, Caroline. It's okay.
 Ahh.
 I am going home for a shower and a stiff drink.
 She doesn't want to see me.
 Yeah, I don't need a lesson on how the humanity-switch works, Ric. Trust me. She doesn't want to see me.
 Hey...
 Caroline...
 You okay?
 
 
 
 
 Hello, Mother. I think it's time you and I have a talk.
 Mmm.
 Whatchu got there, junkie tic?
 I have the same thing. It's funny how that works, isn't it?
 
 You know, Enzo told me a lot of things. Including that, after losing all hope of getting your friends back, you went off the deep end last night.
 
 You know... 
 And then my veins, they begin to itch uncontrollably, and the hunger consumes me. Every sound, every scent  the world around me falls apart, and all I can hear is the pulsing of someone's blood, and all I feel is that it belongs to me.
 
 
 Did you know that she was the one who turned Enzo?
 
 She also has a bit of a Ripper-thing going on. That little stunt you pulled with the Ascendant put her in a blood tizzy.
 
 See? Sublimating can be fun!
 I am not mocking you. I'm... I'm teaching you how to divert an instinctual impulse into a socially acceptable activity. 
 
 
 You were the only person who was able to flip my humanity back on.
 And it worked! All I'm saying is... maybe deep down, you still feel something for me.
 Well, then let's start over  clean slate  and let me help you get through this. We can start something new. You just... You have to trust me.
 
 
 
 Yeah, well, he's not picking up his cell phone right now, which means it's just you and me.
 
 
 
 Lily got away from me, so it's a really bad time to be a human.
 You were right. We've got to lock her up.
 We're right outside, so get home. We'll deal with her.
 Elena's safe. Get up. We need to find Lily.
 
 I think being a human is the last thing you want.
 Do you have any idea what it feels like for me to have to hear it from Enzo? To have no say as to whether I lose my brother or not?
 In a few days, or months, or years, you'll feel different.
 No! No, no, no, no. You don't want to do that. Please don't do that. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 
 You know, earlier, you asked me what it'd feel like to have something I cherished for 150 years ripped away from me. You're right. I'd be devastated.
 It's never too late. That's the upside of eternity. You'll be my mother for the next century, and the one after that, and the one after that. And one day, maybe not soon, but one day... You'll see me as your son.
 Hey, don't you hate weddings anyway?
 Hmm.
 Oh, come on. It's your last few days as a vampire. Can't blame me for wanting to spend some quality time with my brother. Ah, look, here we are.
 You know Mr. Rogers is dead, right?
 So, this is a house I lived in during one of my many attempts to start over. Welcome to your suburban nightmare.
 Well, I think you've thought about a life with Elena. I don't think you've thought about neighbors or a mortgage or  (A boy who is playing in the yard next door accidentally kicks a ball at Damon)  or kids. I don't know, might not be your thing.
 Well, considering the fact that you actually have to eat as a human, I just wanted to give you a little taste of what your dinner's gonna look like. You don't cook, Elena doesn't cook. Who has time anyway with work and kids, right?
 Mmm, Salisbury steak. Dig in, Damon. You're gonna need all that energy for these.
 That's just the rest of your life.
 Let me ask you something, When was the last time you filled out paperwork of any kind... taxes, health insurance, driver's license?
 You will, the first time you encounter some moron that you can't kill or compel.
 Which you won't be able to afford unless you have a job, and if you're about to say you can borrow money from me, you can't.
 Actually it is. See, I won't know where you live. You'll have the cure running through your veins, and if I know where you are, then someone can use me to track you down and take the cure from you and turn you into a 172-year-old corpse.
 What's the matter? Haven't thought that far ahead? See eventually, word will spread, and you and Elena will have to move away. You'll have to isolate yourself, no friends, no family. This will be your life, Damon. This will be your hell.
 You know how you and I were both worried that he didn't think this through? He thought it though.
 He's ready to do this, Elena. He's got your perfect little life all planned out.
 Yep. Tuxes are in the car, we're good to go.
 Oh, hey, just one more thing.
 Break-ups
 Well, I guess you hadn't really thought about that, right? What if you and Elena aren't really soulmates?
 Yeah, you sound like me, four years ago. You know, Elena and me, we were soulmates, too.
 Hey, I'm just being realistic. I mean what if something goes wrong? You're still human, still isolated, still alone.
 Right, cause couples stay together forever? They never fight, they never hurt each other, they never drift apart? Hey. Let me show you.
 Oh, that's just two years in. Wait 'til you hit seven.
 Even if you and Elena defy every single statistic and stay in love every hour of every day... You still can't control life or death. She's human. She could die at any moment. What is your life gonna look like without her?
 She wanted me to be harsh.
 You know, if you do this Damon, you're human forever. No matter what happens, there's no going back.
 That's the thing, I can't tell you, Elena can't tell you. You can't do this for me or for her, you have to want to be human for yourself.
 I'm not used to scaring people away.
 Uh-oh, Elena's human again. Am I sensing another brother swap?
 No, he needed some time to think.
 Well, it's not up to me.
 Look, of course I don't want him to take it. He's my brother. The thought of losing him is...
 Well, you never knew Damon as a human.
 He was aimless. Always searching for something more. Sweet and earnest to a fault, but never strong  that came later, when he found himself  when he truly became Damon.
 He loves being a vampire, and I just don't think he'll ever give that up.
 You're avoiding me.
 Can we talk?
 Alright, just say it  I'm wrong, I'm making this about me, I'm being selfish.
 Hmm. Yeah, that's uh... that's way up there.
 No, of course I don't hate you. Doesn't mean that I don't hate the way you handled things.
  Caroline 
 Well, I forgive you.
 That's because you're a control freak who's lost control. I feel the same way when I'm around you. That's what falling for somebody is. It's being vulnerable. It's  (He grabs her hand again)  giving up control.
 Uh, hey, look, I don't want to tell you how to run your wedding, but...
 Get her to the hospital, now.
 Get in the car, please.
 Who are you talking about?
 He lied to you. There's nobody out here. You made a deal with a sociopath, and now a lot of people are dead. You're wasting your time!
 Let me guess, not there either.
 No, I came here to put you back in your cell where you belong.
 Would you please just stop it with the word "family?" They're just a bunch of random people that you happened to sire!
 Lily, you either come with me right now, or you're out of my life. Do you understand me? Your son.
 What did you give Kai?
 Tell me what you gave Kai in return for your family!
 Well, you're the one who chose a five mile hike to say goodbye to me.
 Because you're a weak human again?
 Well, a lot of good that did.
 Don't. I can't do this, not  not now, not never
 Bonnie tracked Kai. He want to go beat the sleeping spell out of him.
 Are you?
 I don't think Elena necessarily came into my life to be my soulmate. I mean, she was. We loved each other, but she was also the only person I've ever met who actually believed that my brother was worth loving, and she reminded me that I used to believe that about him, too. And her faith in him, it brought Damon and me back together. And yeah I I loved her more than I could ever thought I could love somebody else. But I think, in the end, I needed him more then I needed her. Is that why... you feel you need to stay away from me, is it because you think that I haven't moved on?
 I can guarantee it won't be high school
 I'll see you, Elena.
 If word gets out that her body has the cure inside, every vampire who wants to be a human will come busting through that door.
 I guess that means that 
 Yesterday, you told me you made a list of all the ways that loving me has ruined your life, and I get it. I haven't made it easy on you...
 But I made a list, too, of all the ways that loving you has changed mine.
 You were by my side when I needed a friend. You made me laugh. You made me dance. You told me that I would find love again... And, I understand if you need time to heal, and to live your life without me. And, I understand if I have to wait for you, and I will, I'll wait. And when you're ready for me, I will be ready for you
 Damon, wake up! I need you! Wake up!
 Damon, wake the hell up!
 Whatcha writing?
 Matt reported some blood bags missing from the hospital, so I thought I'd check it out.
 If it's not, then she has quite literally dropped off the face of the earth, and I'm still deciding if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
 
 I made this, uh, a thing, didn't I?
 I told you how I felt about you, and now it's- it's weird.
 
 Alright, how about this? New rule  you live your life, you heal, and in the meantime, we're friends.
 Good. Okay, happy writing!
 Listen, these bodies? They're not Lily's style. It's got to be the Heretics.
 Matt found a house that's been in foreclosure for the last two years, and it had its power mysteriously turned back on just days after Ric's wedding, so Caroline is there staking it out.
 Listen, I need Ric to tell me how to make a bomb.
 Alaric? I need you to teach me how to make a bomb...
 I am literally staring at a treasure trove full of your, uh, fancy little weapons.
 Uh, it's not that easy. I mean, if we want to take them out, we have to do it all at once.
 Enzo?
 Whoa, whoa!
 First of all, this is a bomb.
 That there is the timer.
 I'm gonna set it for sixty seconds.
 Are you sure that you want to do this?
 I'm just saying... If you think this is a crazy plan, now's the time to speak up.
 
 I hope you weren't too attached to that house. We blew it into a pile of ash with your family inside.
 They're gone, Lily. And you have until tonight to get out of Mystic Falls, or we come after you next.
 Hey, I think we have a problem.
 Ugh! Ugh!
 
 I have no idea.
 There's a splinter embedded in my neck, and I can't seem to get it out...
 Thank you.
 
 
 
 
 How's Europe?
 Eh, it can wait 'til you get back.
 The whole town would have been slaughtered.
 We already tried that.
 
 Look, what's done is done. Do not mess this up.
 
 You know, Elena wanted you to be happy. To live. Even encouraged you to date. But, if she wakes up and everyone she loves is dead, do you think she's going to be able to forgive that?
 I'm not doing this for Caroline, Damon. I'm doing this for you.
 
 Well, what would Sheriff Forbes do?
 Well, then, no. I don't think we're making a mistake.
 
 Heh. I'm gonna go, uh, board up the front door.
 
 
 Come on. Ugh!
 
 
 It's okay. I speak mute. Just communicate what you want with a series of grunts...
 AHHH!
 
 No, I didn't, because we didn't do it.
 
 You killed him, didn't you?
 
 
 She took Caroline.
 To retaliate for breaking our "bad deal," she took Caroline.
 Yeah, I know I wasn't. You were. Which is why you are gonna go over there, and you're gonna fix it.
 I only hear one set of footsteps.
 Huh. Well, looks like nobody wants you around, do they?
 
 You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
 Hmmm.
 You know, it's funny that you think that she's the villain when you're the one who killed one of her loved ones.
 No, but I'm definitely not taking yours.
 
 
 
 I am not willing to let Matt die.
 What'd they do to you?
 I'm going to get your out of here. Just hang on.
 Looks like I'm gonna have to scoop you up and carry you out of here.
 Oh...
 It's like your skin is vervain.
 It's alright. When we get out of here, we'll call Bonnie. There's got to be a way to get rid of this. As for now, we have to... avoid skin-to-skin contact.
 I know that's gonna be extra-hard for you.
 I'm gonna call Damon and tell him that we're ready.
 
 
 What, no comeback? Hmmm? No funny reason?
 ANSWER ME!
 
 
 She has Elena. She has our house. She has this whole damn town!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I'm way ahead of you. Take care of yourself, Tyler.
 
 
 How are you on my phone right now?
 
 
 I will. Lily's only keeping you there to turn me against Damon. I'll convince her that I hate his guts, and she'll have made her point.
 
 
 Caroline?
 You can take my town, you can destroy my house, but you will not touch my car.
 
 Listen  you need to tell those spoiled brats living in my house to stop torturing Caroline.
 Damon and I aren't really speaking right now.
 
 
 
 
 Stefan Salvatore. Are you new to town?
 
 Why did you send Valerie to me?
 
 Well, your first husband shot and killed his own sons, so you'll have to excuse me if I don't trust your type.
 
 Your daughter and I were just appreciating the scientific wonder of gravitational force!
 
 I have a brother who's away at war, a father who judges me for not joining him, and a mother who was strong and kind. She died when I was ten.
 
 
 
 How did he not see us?
 Julian is going to kill me.
 
 Do you mind if I...?
 No, no, no! Keep the car on this side of the road!
 Well, Valerie never told me that you were alive.
 
 My mother was practically ripped out of my arms and sent to a TB ward. You don't move on from that. You find distractions.
 Come with me. I want to show you something.
 This is my mother's grave.
 
 
 I always wonder what would have happened if I had just been able to run a little faster. The tonic would have helped her. She could have lived.
 Yes. Cream...
 
 
 When will I see you again?
 No, no. Keep your eyes on the road.
 Make a left here. It'll take us back into town.
 No. I mean, it doesn't matter  obviously, it was all a lie, right?
 Well, Valerie was using me.
 
 No? How about the part where she sent me a telegram saying she was coming back?
 She'd been gone a few months...
 
 
 
 
 Ahhh!
 How did you escape?
 
 Heh... Look, I was just a kid when I met her. Just a troubled boy mourning his dead mom. I was young and human.
 Things have changed. Different circumstances, different results.
 Of course not.
 I don't wonder anymore. I don't care about the past. All I care about is that you're here, and you're safe. You're with me.
 How the hell did you let this happen?
 No, you're just the one who chased him down, kidnapped him... and are still technically holding him hostage.
 
 I don't have to be on her side to see what's happening here. You can't be with Elena, so you're making all your bad decisions about Elena.
 
 And I've been judging.
 Not gonna find him in there.
 Hey!
 Hmmm. 'Kay.
 "A message from Miss Nora Hildegard, dictated but not read. For every hour that Oscar isn't returned, a Whitmore student will die... Starting now."
 Hi! Brought you coffee.
 
 
 No. There's nothing to avoid.
 
 
 Let's just say that it involves two bored mean-girls on a campus full of easy targets. But, I have come up with a genius plan to keep them occupied while Damon sorts out his Oscar problem.
 Mmhmm.
 And distractions! All in one place. Easy to babysit. I think the hardest part will be feigning enthusiasm.
 That's not the Valerie that I knew.
 
 You weren't... Oh, I don't know... Already coming to this and just, uh, forgot to invite me?
 
 
 Oh, they're here. Guess it's time to babysit.
 Three. That's the number of people Caroline and I have saved. Barely.
 
 Do you think they forgot they came here to murder people?
 You got all that from... that?
 You know, I'd ask you to dance, but...
 I will ask Valerie to undo it once Damon brings Oscar back to life.
 
 That's what I'm scared of? Or that's what you're scared of?
 Why? You're done here.
 Where's Nora?
 I'm sorry.
 
 
 Or as if confronting my first love will somehow make her disappear.
 Caroline thinks that Valerie's mere existence is somehow sabotaging our relationship. But, if she could just get into my head, she would see that the only thing standing between me and my girlfriend is that damn spell... Which you can remove.
 I got you. Come on. Come on.
 Siphon the repulsion spell off of Caroline, or your girlfriend dies. Do you see how easy I made that for you?
 Did it work?
 Yes, it can. That's the whole point.
 Mmhmm.
 
 The reason that I'm not talking about Valerie is because I'm not thinking about Valerie. I'm thinking about you, and how you and I have had more history in the last five years than most people have in a lifetime.
 This is torture for you, isn't it?
 Hmm.
 Mmhmm. Just making a mental checklist of all the things you need to do today? Debating whether you should accidentally kick me awake?
 Hmm?
 Oh...
 Is there any particular reason as to why you are barging into my girlfriend's dorm room at the crack of mid-morning?
 
 
 
 Valerie.
 Quit torturing my brother and tell me exactly what's going on here.
 At the town fair.
 
 
 Well, she was just spying for Lily. I mean, it was all a game, wasn't it?
 But, yeah. No! Hey, hey, keep going man. This bit is, uh, absolutely hilarious.
 
 Some gas station in the middle of nowhere.
 Sorry about that. The fumes are, uh, getting to his brain. Hey, listen  uh, I want to take you to dinner tonight.
 
 Ah. No, don't feel guilty. I... I needed a push.
 
 She didn't deny it.
 I will be, once you tell me what time I'm picking you up tonight.
 
 Why would Oscar stash Julian's body out here in the middle of nowhere when he could just hand him over to Lily?
 So, you killed him. That makes a lot of sense.
 You know, I was thinking... It's probably a good thing that you and I cut things short. I mean, what if I'd accidentally insulted your driving, and you had no choice but to run a butcher knife through me?
 You know, we got Nora to siphon that repulsion spell you put on Caroline... Just in case you were wondering.
 Why'd you do it? I mean, you couldn't have been worried about Caroline's safety.
 Well, if that's the truth, then yeah.
 
 This one won't open.
 Hey, we get it. You're angry.
 
 UGH!
 Valerie.
 Valerie!
 Hey! You okay?
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Whatever you're thinking, we're not gonna do that.
 She's still our mother.
 
 We're not gonna let her walk away from that. I promise. But, right now, I need to find Valerie, so just tell me that you're fine and you're not gonna do anything stupid.
 
 Valerie! Don't move. I'm gonna get these out.
 Well, maybe it's pointless, but I'm not the type to leave someone hanging.
 
 
 
 What?
 
 ...I'm actually still in Mystic Falls.
 I'm sorry.
 Things got... complicated.
 
 No. No, nothing. I'll see you tomorrow?
 Bye.
 I didn't really know what to say.
 
 That's how you became a vampire? You killed yourself?
 I won't. I promise.
 
 Look, we have, um, five guest rooms. You should probably stay the night.
 
 Hold the gun. There you go. Now, the first thing you want to do  bite the paper off the cartridge like this.
 Hand me that ramrod.
 
 Push it all the way down. Perfect.
 Well, you see that, uh... You see that tree over there with the bark falling off?
 Pretty far, then, huh?
 I don't know. Think you're old enough?
 I was twelve when I shot my first gun...
 You think so?
 All right. Okay. Let's go find ourselves a deer. Come on.
 Now, the trick is, never take your eye off the target. Got that?
 Jacob?
 
 Jacob! Jacob! Jacob!
 Hey.
 Who?
 Oh, um... must have been a bad dream.
 Stayed. Past tense. Um, just one night.
 Okay. Lily wants to raise Julian from the dead. Valerie tried to scorch his body before she could get her hands on him, and that did not work out so well...
 
 Well, maybe you can just trust me that I know what I'm doing.
 No. No.
 Mmhmm.
 You know, I really like this form of manipulation.
 Ah, going no tie? I'm going no tie.
 You saw her invite. Julian's back. You're going!
 You do realize that "zombie douche-brain boy-toy" is living in your house? Bathing in your tub, eating your Froot Loops?
 What are you getting at?
 
 That might he a bit of a problem, brother, because I plan on killing the bastard tonight.
 
 Thank you.
 Compliments of the Lockwood cellar.
 Ooh, where did all these people come from?
 
 What are you doing here?
 
 Mmhmm.
 
 
 
 Hmm.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You need to help me kill him, or you need to leave.
 
 Look at your bedroom! Our house is unrecognizable. Lily needs to go, and killing Julian is the start of that.
 It's not my secret to tell, Damon.
 
 My brother told the story wrong.
 It's not about you.
 RAGH!
 He's still alive, so I don't know what you're moping about.
 This isn't about you, Damon. Get over it.
 You don't want to start with me right now, Damon.
 I got Valerie pregnant...
 In 1863. Julian found out about it, and he beat her until the baby was no longer alive.
 
 
 I want him dead Damon. No one's gonna stop me from killing him. Not in six months, not in six weeks  now.
 May I ask you something?
 Did Julian remind you of anyone in particular tonight?
 
 Did it ever scare you? The thought that maybe you'd turn out like our father?
 Hmm.
 Well, I've been on this earth for 160-some years, and I've seen the world at 30,000 feet. I've traveled to every continent, and learned how to cook 
 
 
 
 
 
 I invited you over here because we can't keep doing this. I mean, I... I want us all to start over.
 I want to convince you of all the reasons that you need to help us get rid of Julian.
 
 She kept it a secret from me, from you, from everyone. And Julian found out about it somehow, and he felt threatened by it. He beat her until the baby was no longer alive.
 Her child  your grandchild  was murdered by Julian. She swore me to secrecy, but the truth is too important. You need to know what kind of man he is.
 Wow. I guess the joke's on me then, right? I mean, I was the idiot who believed her.
 Here's to moving on then, right?
 Concentrated vervain.
 I had a feeling we were gonna have to do this the hard way...
 Julian's practically brainwashed you, like Giuseppe did way-back when.
 
 Hey, do you remember that fun-filled Thanksgiving we had back in 1851?
 
 Why is he not eating?
 You're too blind to see it. You're drawn to men who manipulate you into seeing what they want! Men who abuse you.
 
 And by the end of the day, you're gonna help us kill your boyfriend.
 That's enough, Damon.
 It's your pattern, Lily. Julian's a monster. Giuseppe was a monster.
 Lily!
 
 Here.
 I don't understand.
 
 What is he talking about?
 
 What's going on?
 Julian needs to die today. Everything has to appear to be normal. Julian's not an idiot. If he finds out that Lily turned on him, we're all dead.
 
 Well, I guess the only way we're gonna be able to pull this off is to deploy the nuclear option.
 Damon! Lily just texted me their location. Let's do this!
 Oh! Hi.
 
 Uh, what are... what are you doing here?
 Uh... What was that all about?
 Uh, I don't think there are any words...
 I have to go.
 I mean, obviously we need to talk about this. Um... But we have this small window to get to Julian tonight, and this is sort of...
 No, no, no, it's... I mean, yes, it... Yes, um... But we will talk about it when I get back.
 Promise.
 Oh, good old Mom. Bet she made you think she enjoyed it, too, huh?
 Let's tie him up.
 Damon's tying up Julian right now.
 I, uh, got his blood.
 Caroline's pregnant.
 Yeah, I didn't really know what to say, either.
 Gemini spell. Twins. Not mine, obviously.
 Well, I didn't exactly, um, handle things the right way. Any advice?
 Yeah, but now he's gonna die, and you can start over without him.
 You haven't lost me.
 Uh... I guess, uh... Willingness to forgive the unforgivable is in my genetics.
 
 Do you think that I haven't seen that look before? Damon has been practicing that look on me for the last 150 years.
 Time.
 None of the above, although a drink does sound really good right about now.
 Listen, I'm really sorry about earlier. I didn't know what to say, and I didn't want to say the wrong thing, so I just... bailed.
 
 Listen... No matter how... weird this all gets, I'm here for you. We're gonna get through this together.
 
 No!
 You say goodbye.
 Say something.
 She has Damon and Caroline.
 Well, then she's gonna get me. Oh, and I, uh, burned my Porsche, so I kind of need to borrow your car...
 No, you're not.
 She already has two people that I care about.
 I'm not gonna let her have a third, okay?
 Don't be so dramatic.
 I'll be back before you know it.
 What about Julian? Where is he?
 Wait. We should say something.
 Cream violets. You remembered.
 Thank you.
 How many times do you get a second chance to deliver your mother's eulogy?
 I'm so sorry. I promise I'll make this right.
 You know, compelling people to donate doesn't actually count as donating...
 Yeah? Put on a Santa hat, you'd fit right in here.
 Sure you don't need me over there?
 Of course you can.
 Caroline? You still there?
 I'm good. I'd be a lot better if my traveling companion would actually stick to task instead of stopping by every single bar we pass by.
 Hmm.
 Ooh. See, the thing is, she's not their mom.
 
 What's that, Damon?
 Oh, wow. You know, in these last few weeks, your jokes, they've gotten quite sad.
 What I need, Damon, is your actions, not your words.
 Yeah. Well, we got to find him to kill him.
 
 What are you trying to say?
 What? Since when you do you think logically?
 So you don't think that Julian deserves to die?
 You are my backup. You're just terrible at it. And if Julian's off the rails, then good. It means he's careless. I mean, look at these wounds. They're fresh, which means he's obviously still in town, so either you help me find him, or...
 So, when do you think this denial phase of yours is gonna come to an end?
 Yeah, I just refuse to believe that you care so little about your own flesh and blood.
 Hmm.
 
 
 
 What do you mean by "we?"
 
 
 
 Hmmm.
 Okay, so we re-load, we figure out a way to separate him from his friends...
 
 You of all people should not be the one to give up! You're the reason he's alive and she isn't.
 Because we would have killed Julian the minute he showed up into our lives, but no. You wanted to punish Lily with a long-con, didn't you?
 Huh. You know, for weeks, I've been watching you. I've been trying to catch even the slightest bit of regret on your face.
 She was dying, Damon? How difficult would it have been to say something nice?
 All she wanted was forgiveness, and you practically spat in her face!
 What, because she made some mistakes? Or is it because she didn't choose poor you over Valerie?
 You acted like a spoiled little brat. A coward. You had a chance to make things right, and you still do.
 I wish. I'm headed home. Damon bailed on me.
 He thinks I'm overreacting.
 We still can. Have you seen Mary Louise?
 I think you've had enough.
 You sure about that? You look like you could use a friend. Things with Nora didn't quite work out, did they?
 
 Stay with her and make sure she's unconscious until Julian's dead.
 Thought you ran away.
 Clearly the feeling wasn't mutual.
 
 No!
 Damon?
 
 He's not gonna make it in there.
 That stone is punishment for every bad thing you've ever done. This is Damon. I don't even want to know what he's going through.
 Unh!
 
 
 That won't be necessary.
 Before you say anything, please don't hold it against Caroline for pulling me out first.
 Well, to be honest with you, I just lived 168 years of mistakes, grief, and pain on a perpetual loop, so I'm down to just skip to the part where we get drunk.
 Cheers.
 Why? What happened to you in there?
 So, it got to you, huh?
 I mean, you didn't feel anything?
 So the part with the innocent people bleeding out all over the farmhouse floorboards, that... that did nothing for you?
 You knew what?
 Unh! Ugh! Ugh!
 
 Because he's not ready yet. When I was in there, I could barely remember who I was, and then I was hit with visions and tests. But the worst part of hell isn't what you're going through  it's the sliver of hope that you can actually get out on your own.
 Because eventually, I submitted to the kind of suffering that just breaks you. Knowing Damon, he'll do anything he can to avoid that kind of pain, which means we may never be able to get him out.
 Brother.
 
 You always have a reason, don't you, Damon? Brother, drinking buddy...
 Her.
 This isn't about what you do in her name, Damon. It's about what you do in her absence!
 Shhh. Quiet. They're here.
 You don't get it, do you? You tell yourself that you're protecting Mystic Falls for Elena. You convince yourself that you're keeping her safe by any means necessary. You justify punishing Lily for Elena's sake. Did you ever once think, "What would Elena do?"
 
 Oooh. 
 The man who spit on our mother's grave. The man who lies to himself even now about what happened here today?
 She's gone!
 The mission went sideways. Innocents died, and you walked away with blood on your hands. What did you want?
 What did you want?
 
 
 Oh. Well, it's too late.
 Hey, its me. It's me! You're safe. It's okay. It's okay.
 Damon, it's not real 
 Yeah. Yeah I heard you.
 Nah, I just wanted to make sure you had a chance to calm down.
 You don't have to explain. It wasn't your fault.
 It was an honest mistake. You're getting a pass.
 You came out of the phoenix stone but you thought you were still inside of it. Everybody understands.
 Yeah, well the hellstone does a number on you.
 Here's the thing, Damon. Um, Hell messes with you, but post-hell is much worse.
 I didn't know you were back.
 I don't think he's talking about the evacuation, Damon.
 
 
 You have no idea what I have been through.
 
 Well, we're celebrating, so I figured we'd take it up a notch, right?
 I don't care. Whatever you want.
 Right. Sorry.
 I'm... I'm fine. Thank you, though.
 How'd you get here?
 Get away from her!
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
 I think you're missing the point.
 
 Good. Then you can prove it to me while I drive you around the new Mystic Falls.
 Ready?
 Well, if that is what I think it is, then I would rather be sent back to the hellstone.
 Well, don't worry. I'm gonna still get him that Baby Bjorn thing, or whatever you made me click on when I was drunk.
 Don't you worry. I will. Bye.
 What?
 Just get inside.
 Yeah. Well, you get used to the smell.
 Well, they tried, but apparently, you weren't ready to be pulled out.
 What happened to you in there?
 Sounds pretty miserable, if you ask me.
 
 Well, I wouldn't call you taking over my town without my permission a truce exactly...
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Today's all about proving that you can play well with others, all right?
 Damon...
 Hey, what are you looking at?
 I think I'm handling it. Thanks.
 When were you going to tell me that you lost your grip on reality?
 
 You were everywhere.
 
 Yeah. The same one. I was in the quarry. I was... I was drowning, and Damon was there.
 Doesn't matter. Its over.
 
 Get out of here, Caroline.
 
 
 
 Why are you still here?
 
 I couldn't stop seeing you. I couldn't stop hearing you. Nothing else mattered. Not our town, not Julian, not even Caroline. All I cared about was making you go away.
 I got a can of gasoline...
 
 
 
 Hey, sorry, I was trying to track down my brother.
 Curly fries or waffle? I brought both.
 Are you talking to me, or are you talking to the fries?
 
 
 Are they kicking again?
 Hey, you okay?
 Okay...
 Hey, hey, Caroline. Hey, Caroline!
 Caroline!
 
 I'm her boyfriend...
 Um, yeah, no  he's in, the father's in Dallas for a job interview. I'll... I'll call him.
 Hey. Scared me there for a minute.
 What is this?
 What did you just do?
 
 Better start getting used to the coffee. Doctor asked her to stay for observation.
 No, he hasn't been returning my calls. Why? Have you?
 
 Damon! Damon! What the hell's going on?
 Hey. Do not get into that ring. Leave with me right now. Whatever's going on, we will figure it out.
 What are you doing? This guy's got three hundred years on you!
 Hey. That stone is still messing with your head, Damon. Let me help you get through it.
 Deserve? What are you talking about? What do you deserve, huh?
 Something happened to you. Tell me. Tell me what happened to you, Damon.
 I'm not just gonna walk away and let you fight this guy to the death.
 Don't do this, Damon. Don't do this!
 Listen to me. If you let Julian rip your heart out, I will kill him and then every single person here will instantly rip my head off. But you don't care, do you? Your life doesn't matter and neither does mine, does it?
 Come on, brother. Come on.
 Hey. Where are you going?
 So you don't have anything to say about what happened back there? Huh?
 Huh?
 
 
 What is this about? What did you do?
 What do you... what do you mean, you killed Elena?
 Argh! ARGH! ARGHHH!
 I'm fine.
 This is all Julian's fault. He took Lily away from me when I was too young to lose a mother. He hurt you. He killed our child. He destroyed Damon. He has my home. He has my town. And what do I do? I let him live.
 I don't want to be the smart one anymore.
 I want him dead.
 No, thank you.
 
 That's all your fault for running that sword through him and sending him to hell.
 Here's the thing... they can't see you.
 Maybe this is cheating... but I don't really care.
 What are you doing here?
 Hey. Sorry it took so long to get back, but Damon...
 Caroline. Caroline... Caroline.
 Sorry.
 Oh, I compelled the doctors to ignore all things medicine couldn't explain.
 No, not yet.
 
 
 Entire drive home, I was trying... to figure out a way to tell Caroline. And I just couldn't find the words.
 You don't have a few hours. Caroline's stable, but the doctor needs to perform the C-section now.
 What the hell was that?
 
 Well, Valerie's plan is to channel enough magic outside of your body so that the babies are drawn to it. That way they don't resist when the doctor tries to pull them out.
 I will call her. And I promise this will all be fine.
 ...She's getting help.
 
 Caroline? I am not gonna let anything happen to you.
 Yeah, and trust me, every possible way you're second-guessing me right now, I've already done it. This is our best chance.
 
 I think it's working.
 Beau's the one who's marked, why doesn't he just go?
 I'm sorry, but I can't let you leave.
 Stay, and I'll do everything I can to protect you from this woman.
 Kind of a bad time.
 Yeah. Heard you were the one who gave it to her. Impeccable timing, considering Caroline literally couldn't be any more helpless right now.
 
 Well, we're under the stars, enjoying each other's company.
 Technically, yes, but symbolically, we are on a date. Will you pass me those fries, please?
 Oh, this one... is yours. Extra pickles.
 No, no. Everything's fine. I just... I figured you've had two lives inside of you for months  lives that you didn't ask for, lives that will change Ric's entire future. So the least I can do is keep you company for a little while. That's all.
 They're about to get the babies out. What's wrong?
 I'm so sorry, Valerie.
 Where's Damon?
 
 
 I'm not going anywhere... Because I love you.
 
 
 Why did you hand over that sword, Damon?
 
 I'm gonna hold you to that.
 Hey. How are you?
 I'm sorry. I wish I could be there. This is the only way I could stop her.
 I promise I will come back for you. I have to keep moving if I want to stay ahead of her. I love you.
 
 And where is this leading me, exactly?
 No, I just pulled over at a Quik-Stop in the middle of nowhere.
 My cell phone's almost dead. I need a charger.
 Hello?
 Hello?
 Hi, I need to buy a charger for my phone?
 That's fine. How much?
 I'm just in town for a little R & R. Hate to disappoint. So... How are Elijah, and, uh, whoever else you've brought back from the dead?
 Damon's looking for me, and I don't want to be found. I figure you, of all people, can relate to family drama.
 I did have some help.
 Sylvia, I think we're gonna need another round.
 Really not a good time.
 Why?
 
 
 Well, to be clear, Caroline practically died in childbirth. And she's not actually their mother. It just sort of... happened.
 
 You've seen this before?
 Why do you think I'm here, Klaus?
 She can't find me in this bar 
 
 
 Hey, I lost my phone. I had to pick up a burner.
 Let's just say I wore out my welcome. I'm back on the road, and, in a shocking turn of events, Damon needs my help.
 Yeah, a little late for that...
 Traveling east on 90. I'll call you later.
 What are you doing here?
 We need to grab her before she comes back to life.
 There's a train station about a mile away. You can just drop me off there.
 Caroline? Why? Do you still have feelings for her?
 
 
 
 You mind just paying attention to the road a little bit more?
 Well, that was the last of Freya's herbs, which means its only a matter of time before they wear off and Rayna can track me.
 
 
 
 Well, you don't actually enjoy this, do you?
 Well, according to Freya, all the herbs witches use are stored here. Just in case something happens to them.
 Yeah.
 And why is that?
 I don't know. You're a witch  why have you never heard of this?
 Mmm, that one I know.
 
 
 Well, her name was Rebekah. Let's just say she was a lot to handle.
 I don't think anyone's ever called Caroline Forbes "easy to handle." And, as thrilling as this therapy session is...
 I think I found it. Or, where it used to be.
 What is it?
 What did she do to me?
 
 There has to be more somewhere.
 Hey. Is this a bad time?
 Oh, I've been better. Looks like it might actually be a while before I can visit. Turns out, those herbs are a little more rare than we thought.
 Hey, listen  I was thinking, um... I've been on the run with Valerie for the last few days, and without those herbs, I'm not going to be able to slow down. But, maybe you could tag in...? I know being on the road seems awful, but it could be fun. We could go to Europe. See the world. Just you and me. What do you think?
 
 He needs you.
 
 Dallas? Uh... I hadn't really thought about it.
 
 
 
 What's happening?
 
 Ah. Looking for a bottle to celebrate? I gotta say, I'm impressed. Got your text. I didn't think you'd be able to kill her.
 
 What? So, you didn't kill her?
 
 Except for that time they did.
 Caroline's staying in Dallas with Ric and the kids.
 
 As long as I have this scar, Rayna will hunt me. This isn't about just you and me anymore  there's kids involved. I'm not gonna put them in danger, which means that I can't be with my girlfriend as long as Rayna is alive. And you just told me she can never died, so we have to figure out another way to get rid of her, or we need to get rid of this scar.
 What is this?
 So, you're just gonna run away?
 
 Listen to me. If there's even a fraction of you that cares about me  your brother, your family  you will not walk out that door.
 Really not the best time, Matt.
 I don't want to have to kick you out of here, but I will.
 Excuse me?
 
 
 Damon. Wake up. I need you! Wake the hell up!
 We gotta go.
 She's back. And the scar, it opened up this morning. It's burning.
 
 
 I'll be back before you know it.
 
 
 
 
 
 You okay?
 Yeah, but... it's my favorite kind. I'm wondering how many more of these I can have, now that I'm on a time limit...
 I'm not talking about tonight. I did the math. Rayna Cruz won't live forever, therefore neither will I. So, tick-tock.
 No, actually. Funny thing is, it makes me feel human again, like every minute counts.
 Right now?
 
 
 So, Damon said he could take my scar through a transfer spell. Does that make any sense to you?
 
 Hey, be careful, okay?
 That's right. It links me to a crazy woman.
 Oh, no, no, no. We're just friends. And she's not crazy. Well... not in a bad way.
 I haven't made her uncomfortable! She doesn't understand what we're saying. Nobody here has any idea what we're saying.
 Yeah. One year of complete and total failure.
 
 No, it's okay. I know what day it is. I've actually been thinking about it quite a bit.
 And I realized that by the time he wakes up, I will probably be dead. So, uh, no... Never gonna call him again.
 So, guess that makes this... obsolete.
 Cheers.
 Caroline?
 
 
 And let you kill my brother? Not likely.
 See, now I'm confused. I thought you were trying to give me a pass?
 
 
 You did just say you spent the last three years spying on me...
 Well, this isn't creepy at all.
 Hey.
 Had to stop for gas.
 Yeah, well, I didn't really have much of a choice. Ditched the sword to buy myself a little bit of time. I could really use a great idea for what to do next.
 Valerie's coming to fix that.
 ...Our friendship evolved.
 
 
 
 You don't know anything about me.
 
 
 
 
 Of course he does. If there's one thing we've learned from our travels all over the world, it's that every bartender has a theory, and every one of them is wrong. Now... look up.
 At the sky.
 Come on! Just humor me. Live in the moment. That's what we're here for, right?
 Yeah.
 They're bigger this close to the equator.
 Cassiopeia is my favorite. Voice of doom. Saw the truth when no one else did.
 No, no, no, no. The constellation's Cassiopeia, that's what I'm saying!
 Yeah, it is! You know why? Because I said so.
 You're right. I am.
 
 
 
 
 
 Say it! I want to hear you say it. You're not taking the scar.
 You always do.
 All right, can we just stay focused here? How far 
 
 Damon, wake the hell up!
 My scar opened up this morning. I figured she was back. I didn't realize she was this close.
 I didn't enjoy being a fugitive.
 Why do you care about my mistakes?
 Yes.
 
 What'd you just call me?
 My name's Stefan Salvatore.
 Yes... I'm in Hell.
 I don't get it. My failed attempt at being a hero, the dead bodies... What's the lesson here?
 I remember being stabbed by the Phoenix Sword, which means this is all some sort of looping nightmare, custom-made from my own psyche.
 
 Hey, officers! Why don't we just get on with it, huh?
 No, but okay...
 I believe you, but that's not my wallet.
 Oh! I get it. I'm a vampire with control issues, and alcoholism is a metaphor for my bloodlust. See, now we're getting somewhere!
 Are we going to a warmer hellscape?
 What is this supposed to prove?
 What did you say?
 
 
 Ah, yes!
 Ah-ha!
 Oh, of course. Of course I'm stuck in the body of an addict. Didn't need a damn Hell-stone to hammer that irony home, did we, Marty? You know, Marty, I spent the last three years knowing my life span was tied to Rayna's. After the initial shock wore off, I actually started to enjoy it. I had an expiration date. That's as close to being human as I was ever gonna get. I guess I forgot how much being a human actually sucks. How everything hurts... all the damn time.
 Ah, come on... Ugh, come on!
 Yes! Yes! Suck on that, you miserable drunk.
 Excuse me, miss? Do you know where we are?
 
 
 This. You. If you're here, then I'm safe, and I owe you one.
 But, if you're a hallucination, then I've entered the delirium phase of my withdrawal, which means I am officially and royally screwed.
 Hello?
 Damon?
 Yeah, well, at least I'm starting to warm up. Which, in case you didn't know, is a bad sign.
 
 Alone in the wilderness, trapped in the frozen corpse of an alcoholic murderer? Uh, I don't know... Seems kind of fitting to me.
 Day late and a dollar short. You suck at playing hero, brother.
 Should I list all the ways in which this mess is your fault?
 You bailed on me, Damon.
 Even before that. You bailed on me when you decided you'd rather live in a coffin than own up to your mistakes.
 And why is that so hard for you, Damon? Don't say "Elena." You lived 160 years before you met her. I got ripped out of hell and thrown into a dead man's body, and do you know what my first thought was when I came to? "I need to save those people on the bus." I didn't know who I was, I didn't know where I was... it was my instinct. What are your instincts, Damon? What does the voice in your head say?
 
 Yes.
 Yes.
 I'm walking.
 You want to know why this is so hard?
 
 Well, safe to say I do not appreciate it at this particular moment.
 How about the inability to compel people?
 
 
 Once, maybe.
 Then why was it so hard for you to find me?
 Maybe you were hoping Father would catch me and punish me.
 
 Damon...? What's wrong?
 Are those...?
 Mmmmm... You asked me what I missed most about being human? The ecstasy of eating this... incredibly crappy doughnut.
 Not by a long shot.
 
 What happened?
 Where are we?
 
 
 Damon, I can't go to a hospital! Marty Hammond got loaded and crashed a bus full of kids. There's an interstate manhunt going on.
 
 Oh! No, no, no. Just... just one.
 
 She returns all of them unopened. Maybe this is the one she'll read.
 Do you have a piece of paper and a pen? I need to write a letter... in case I don't make it out of this.
 I guess being human still has a few privileges.
 What am I doing here?
 You're in my head, aren't you?
 Do I even want to know what's happening out there?
 You wouldn't happen to be lying to me, would you? Because if I'm about to die a painful death in a strange human's body, then I want to make the most of my time.
 Well... I've actually had a lot of time to think lately.
 And I wouldn't have to run anymore. I wouldn't have the scar. My life wouldn't be tied to Rayna's.
 Or, we could stay closer to home.
 No. Of course not.
 
 Valerie? What's wrong?
 Valerie, what's happening?
 What? No, you've never been a distraction.
 Valerie! It's the spell. It's hurting you.
 Valerie, stop the spell right now! It's too strong for you. It's killing you.
 
 Do not sacrifice yourself for me, do you understand?
 
 Valerie, stop the spell!
 Valerie? Valerie?!
 It's me. It's me.
 It's me.
 Ahhh. Better?
 Hmmm. Catching up on your, uh, correspondences?
 Uh... I'm standing right here. You don't have to right me a letter.
 
 Valerie...
 I'm so sorry...
 
 Hi.
 No. No escapades, no scar, no running from Rayna. And thank you for your help with that, by the way.
 So, anyway, I was actually hoping to, uh, speak to Caroline.
 Ah.
 Do you think I could...?
 Thanks.
 No, no, it's, uh... it's nice.
 
 Well, the... supernatural world...?
 No, no. Can't say that I have.
 I could probably use something stronger.
 Damon and I are on a bit of a time-out.
 
 Well, that's not exactly how it went down.
 There's more to the story.
 Not at the time, no.
 Look, I made a choice back then, and I think that she deserves to know what and why.
 What?
 
 Probably. Why?
 
 I'm with Ric. Just tell us what we can do.
 Fore!
 Yeah?
 Trees... Sky...
 ...Vervain grenades?
 How's Bonnie doing?
 He's circling around the next campsite to lay cover fire on any egress routes. I don't know. His words, not mine.
 He's only tolerating me because we're doing this for Bonnie. And if this is how Ric feels, imagine how much worse it's gonna be with Caroline.
 Yeah, but the part where you helped Bonnie, that wasn't too terrible, was it?
 Don't what?
 Well... I think that's something that she's gonna have to decide for herself.
 
 I get all that.
 You know her pretty well, huh?
 So, who sleeps in the second bedroom?
 Well, I was at your house. I saw the nursery for the twins, and I also saw two separate bedrooms. And then I saw an appointment for a Justice of the Peace, which doesn't seem very Caroline Forbes. So tell me  after you get home from City Hall on Friday, is that when she's gonna start sleeping in your bed?
 You can make look your relationship look good on paper, but deep down, it's a lie.
 Ric.
 Look, this didn't go how I wanted it to, all right?
 Caroline...
 What's wrong?
 Finished off the ones in Huntsville and Birmingham.
 Well, Damon, you're the authority on being hated, so why don't you tell me how to deal with the situation.
 I'm not mad, I'm just tired. Who's next on my hit list?
 Doesn't sound very enlightened. That's why I'm partnering you up with Donovan.
 Matt? He wants me dead. He released Rayna to kill me.
 Long story.
 Oh, I guess I don't really have much of a choice, do I?
 It's funny coming from a guy working so hard to save his friend's life.
 Do you want me to find a decent radio station to cover up the silence?
 Or we can just talk about your vendetta against me. Seriously, man, whatever's going on, let's just get it all out. I mean, you blackmailed us into leaving our home. Wasn't that enough?
 Do I even want to know what the first is?
 I'm sorry. That's awful.
 I heard it was a car accident.
 You got lots of privacy. Plenty of neighborhoods to grab somebody from. Feed at your leisure. Stash the bodies, no trace. Won't have to worry about someone like you coming after them. Which makes me curious. You did such a good job clearing vampires out of Mystic Falls. What makes you convinced that Penny's death wasn't a car accident?
 So what did you find?
 Yeah, I was there. I came back for the anniversary of the sheriff's death. I knew it'd be a hard day for Caroline, and I thought there would be a good chance she'd show up, and if she did, I wanted to be there for her.
 No, she never did. Do you really think that I would hurt Penny?
 You okay?
 Well, it looks like you pulled it off. That's got to tip the scales in your favor with Bonnie.
 Well, with you, it usually is. And yeah, by the way, I'm still mad at you. You put me, quite literally, through hell and I'm not ready to let that go yet. But don't think I'm not noticing all the good you've been doing lately. Keep it up. It means something.
 Well, it looks like we're all done here.
 It was an accident, Matt. Penny didn't suffer. And you never saw me here.
 No, you don't.
 Matt, I know this is hard for you, but you have to trust me. Anything I tell you will only make it worse.
 Sorry, am I doing something illegal?
 Oh, right. No, I can explain that, I'm...
 If that's what you think, then maybe you should pull the trigger, Matt.
 You don't want to know.
 It's too late. No.
 Matt? I'm sorry.
 Matt.
 It's okay.
 I'm sorry.
 Look, I just didn't want you to be consumed by one moment in your life that you couldn't take back.
 Can't blame yourself, Matt.
 I only came back...
 
 Yeah, sorry. I've been a little busy telling Matt Donovan he's the reason his fiancÃ©e's dead.
 Probably not. You also probably don't want to know how screwed you are with Bonnie either. 
 My head is in the game, Damon. My life was blown apart when I was marked by Rayna's sword, you remember that? I had to leave everything I loved behind and run for years. So as much as I want Bonnie to wake up, I'm not exactly looking forward to doing that again.
 Well, I never said I didn't have an idea.
 Rayna used to say that she had to kill me, but she didn't want to. She could sense my humanity through some sort of psychic link. So if Bonnie's fighting the same war in her head, we need to give her some ammunition.
 She's right.
 I just wanted to see if you needed anything.
 Okay, I can take a hint. 
 What happened? How'd it go?
 In the dream?
 I don't know. You may have been marked.
 It's real. And if Bonnie wakes up, you're the first person she kills.
 Well, you can slow down and talk to me.
 Caroline, when you were in Bonnie's head, she must have created some sort of psychic link... The scar is just a manifestation of that connection. You need to get as far away from her as you can. Starting now.
 Caroline, I carried that scar with me for three years. I've lived through this before.
 Caroline, just...
 
 Yep.
 Be mad all you want, just do it while you're looking at these. 
 All that matters is that we get moving, and we stay moving now.
 Fine. You want to do this alone, that's your choice.
 Yeah, until it comes to life and death, and then it's not up for discussion. There's always a choice.
 ...And then I lost her. Elena asked me to rescue her friend from the bottom of a river instead of her, and she died because I respected her damn choice.
 Caroline, listen to me. When you bring your family into this, you're putting them in danger too.
 Got Caroline out of town.
 Well, jamming her with a syringe full of vervain might have had something to do with it.
 If you're agreeing with me, then I know I really screwed up.
 
 Yeah... Hero never gets the girl, right? You of all people should know that.
 
 I know. Believe me, I've been there.
 Look, when I went to go find you in Dallas, here's what I saw... I saw you and Ric and the kids, and you were happy. You know what I didn't see? Me. So, I convinced myself that I was doing right by you, even though I had no idea what I was doing. I'm sorry. And you have every right to hate me for what I did to you three years ago.
 Just don't pretend that you wouldn't act any differently. You're doing the same thing with Bonnie right now. You can't accept a world where Bonnie dies. Even though that's a choice that she's trying to make for herself, and you know why? Because you love her too much and there's nothing wrong with that, and I love you, and the thought of you getting hurt... it's not an option that I'm willing to entertain.
 I know. All I can do is say that I'm sorry and hope that you'll forgive me one day.
 And from there?
 You can't keep putting these decisions off.
 I wasn't talking about that decision. Do you love him?
 You need to get as far away from her as you can.
 Do you love him?
 I'm still mad at you. You put me, quite literally, through hell, and I'm not ready to let that go yet. But don't think I'm not noticing all the good you've been doing lately.
  You haven't heard from him?
 All right, well, where is she now?
 Flights got cancelled because of the storm. Where are you?
 Guys, it doesn't matter. Bonnie sealed the whole Armory. You can't get in.
 That's great, but I have absolutely no idea where to find her.
 We'll find Valerie.
 It's your decision. Period.
 No?
 Hmm. Not even a...a little bit?
 I feel...a thaw.
 Okay.
 We're on 60.
 I got this. (Stefan puts the car in reverse, tires squealing, engine revving. He drives back toward the opposite direction, on coming car horns honking at them.)
 All you have to do is let us drive by you, Bonnie.
 Yes, you can.
 Come on... Bonnie.
 We have to assume they are. And that she's still after us.
 Nothing. Listen...you should get going.
 I haven't heard from Damon, which means he probably has a plan that doesn't involve us. Therefore, it can't be a good one. I should handle it.
 Salvatore Airlines, may I help you?
 Wow. Considering the fact that I tracked down you, your pilot and your plan, all in a little bit of brotherly intuition, yes, Damon, as a matter of fact, I do.
 Oh, come on. We both know that's not why you're getting on the plane.
 Really? Because I think you're headed to Dallas to kidnap two innocent children.
 Hmm. And if he says no?
 No. The right thing to do is to let Caroline, their mother, decide what's best for them.
 Well, it's her choice and I'm gonna let her make it. See ya.
 Well, you're awfully quiet. Don't tell me you're still mad about the pilot. Caroline's bringing her kids, and we're gonna get inside, and that's all that matters.
 Do you really think that I did the right thing by taking Caroline against her will?
 You said that's how you know you love someone. And for a second there, I actually, I actually believed you. I thought that my love for Caroline was so strong that I would do anything to protect it. But then I realized, that's not love, Damon. That's fear.
 That night that you put yourself down, it wasn't because you loved Elena. It was because you were afraid if you didn't, you would do something terrible, and you would lose her forever. And that fear, that fear was so powerful that it overrode any love that you felt for me or Bonnie or anybody else.
 Oh, it had absolutely everything to do with me. No. I looked you in the eyes, Damon, and I begged you to stay. And you turned your back on me like it was nothing. And I thought about that yesterday, when I "pulled a Damon." And I realized...I never want to be that person. I refuse to be ruled by fear. I refuse to be you.
 They're here.
 Whatever you're about to say, just...say it when this is over. (Stefan enters behind Damon, who shuts the door behind them.)
 Wow, this looks... promising.
 So this thing the was in the vault that no one was supposed to open, do we know what it is?
 Ah.
 So let's just find this thing and get the hell out of here.
 Ahh, we've searched everywhere else. You know, if you're scared, Damon, you can go, uh, wait outside with the three-year-olds. Damon. You ready to do this or what?
 Like hell you are. Whatever's down there is nobueno.
 Which is why you need me.
 I don't care. I can help you.
 Damon, I...
 Okay. Listen, if-if you need me, I'll be...
 It's not over yet.
 You're still here.
 He's okay.
 So, um, I guess whatever you wanted to say to me, you can...say it now.
 The vault. But he closed the security door.
 Why didn't you bring Enzo?
 
 
 That's cute.
 ...Isn't it?
 Sounds like you're worried she's getting "sparkly" with Ric.
 Ooh, maybe... he's eating the sandwich crusts.
 Well, I'm going back over all the Central State Missing Person Reports for the last four weeks to see if I missed a pattern.
 Yeah.
 Bye.
 It's better than yesterday.
 Look, I know it's not much, but it's a lead, I mean, all those missing people along the trail we've been following, and this is the first time a body has surfaced.
 Yeah, well, I can't let myself think like that. I have to treat every single clue like it's the one that's gonna lead us to them.
 Bonnie, no one  not Caroline, not Elena, no one  knows how to fight longer or harder or better than you. If you give up, I won't have anything left to hold on to. Please don't give up.
 Excuse me.
 We're not press. We're not anyone, but tell us what you know.
 Or a person...
 The gas odometer only had three miles on it. That's strange  maybe that means something?
 How far from the crime scene?
 I'll go check it out. I'll call you back.
 I just walked in.
 Everything okay?
 Damon?
 What is all this? What are you doing?
 What was in that vault, Damon? What has a hold of you?
 Where's Enzo?
 In a slaughterhouse?
 You flipped your switch, didn't you?
 I can help you get your humanity back.
 What are you talking about?
 You're not making any sense.
 Not without you.
 Don't do anything you might regret. Think about Elena.
 Why? Because you flipped your switch?
 I said no.
 We have to leave. It's not safe.
 Fine. Let her go, and we'll be on our way.
 Let's get out of here.
 
 
 
 
 Hey.
 You flipped your switch, didn't you?
 Why?
 So what does your boss think of your daily hobby of tracking crime reports?
 Well, Enzo's playing double agent, so I'm guessing he needs to pick his moments.
 What?
 I'm guessing Enzo picked his moment.
 Because there's another Sarah Nelson living in North Carolina. Her real name is Sarah Salvatore. She's my last living relative. Unless  DAMON  gets to her first.
 Sarah's mother was Zach Salvatore's girlfriend in 1994.
 But it does make the short list. The baby survived. She grew up as Sarah Nelson.
 He wouldn't. He doesn't even know that she exists.
 Look, I'm not trying to get in his head, I just... I'm trying to save Sarah, that's all.
 Well, I was hoping you'd be a little less pissed at me for trying to keep you safe.
 I'll stay with her while you guys get the car.
 Look, she wasn't being herself that day.
 Damon, don't! Don't.
 I can't. And you can't kill her. She's part of our family.
 She's Uncle Zach's daughter. Her name is Sarah Salvatore.
 Listen to me, when I saw you last, you were talking like a crazy person, saying your fate has been sealed by the evil you've done. I'm here to tell you that you're wrong. You're not destined to go to hell, Damon. Do you wanna to know why?
 My point is, you can't be held accountable for a murder you didn't commit. Sarah is not on your list of sins, if that sort of thing even exists. So if you let her go now, it'll balance the scales even more.
 Even if it doesn't, you have to let her walk away. It's what Elena would want and I know you can understand that. Come on, Damon. Make the right choice. Do it for our family. Do it for Elena. And do it for me.
 Go. Run. Get out of here.
 No.
 Stay with me, Sarah.
 You can still make this right. Damon, you have to help her.
 I'm so sorry.
 Damon, wake up!
 My brother's a lot stronger than you think.
 Caroline?
 I would have gone with you.
 No, not particularly.
 Actually, I have to. Last Salvatore standing. Every blood relative I've ever had, ever known... after today, they are all gone.
 Look, I know you're gonna say it's not my fault that Sarah died, but it was. I am part of the reason that every Salvatore is dead. I mean, either I put 'em in harm's way, or I killed them myself.
 Yeah, he is. I saw it happen. He belongs to the siren now.
 I won't. Hey... I want to show you something. Come on.
 This got delivered while we were out today. The girls' beds should arrive tomorrow.
 I'm knocking this wall out so that they can fit side by side.
 Yeah. I mean, I figured they might want to come visit sometime. Is that okay?
 Well, why not? You're my family now.
 Hey. Check it out. It's antique.
 Actually, that's for you. I was hoping you might wear it.
 Do I really need to say it?
 Caroline Elizabeth Forbes, will you do me the honor of wearing this engagement ring? As a... a token of my love?
 I... want you... to marry me. Will you?
 Caroline Elizabeth Forbes, I want you to marry me.
 Yeah, he is. I saw it happen. He belongs to the siren now.
 Yeah, Caroline said you were, but I just wanted to talk to you myself, that's all. (chuckles)
 And what do they, uh, think that they're doing?
 Ah.
 And how's that deadline coming along? Caroline said you might've figured out how the, uh, Armory captured the siren in the first place.
 Would it be going out on a limb to say that we stab her with it?
 Why is he coming after ya? It makes no sense.
 Right. Yeah, sorry, I was child-proofing. But the crossbows are still in the library. Listen, I'm gonna try to track Damon, and with any luck, the drone will lead us back to the queen.
 Ric's still working on that part. Your deadline just got moved up. You don't have days. You have hours.
 Calling me from your own phone. Gutsy. What makes you think I won't use it to track you down?
 Why would you tell me that?
 And what would that be?
 Look if this is all some sort of an elaborate trap, we might as well skip to the part where you spring it.
 With what?
 Well, if you cant tell me how to save you, then I'm at a loss, because I'm running out of ways to pull you back from the brink.
 Not yet. But I'm not about to let Elena wake up to find out you murdered her best friend.
 Then, who's it for?
 That's what this is about? You two fight each other to the death?
 So you don't want me to help you fight Sybil. You actually want me to help you fight Enzo?
 Hey. If Enzo can fight this, why can't you, Damon?
You can't kill Enzo. Bonnie would never forgive you.
 Enzo... you need to run.
 I am not letting you two kill each other.
 Caroline, stay out of this. I promised Bonnie.
 Damon, it's over. You're free now.
 What work? What does she want with you?
 Maybe now we'll get some answers. You sure you can handle Enzo?
 You know, if you need my help with getting him to the cabin...
 Okay.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 I hated us being on the opposite side of the fight today.
 I know. I know what you had to do. But I hated it. I hate all this.
 Dear Elena, where to begin?
 Thanks. Just trying to figure out a fresh new way to deliver the same bad news.
 Thanks. Though I'm not sure today's how I wanted to spend the first day of it. Not to mention my best man just tried to take out a good chunk of the wedding party.
 I don't know. This is different. I've never seen him like this before. I really hoped that when we put Sybil down, it'd break whatever control she had over him. That he'd go back to being whatever Damon's version of normal is again. But somehow, some way, she still has ahold of him.
 Damon, it's over. You're free now.
 I really hoped that when we put Sybil down, it'd break whatever control she had over him. But somehow, some way, she still has ahold of him.
 Right, yeah, no. I-I crashed at the Armory. I figured I'd give you two some space. How's Bonnie doing?
 Well, if anyone can bring him back, Bonnie can. Hey, you know what, I should probably get going. Alaric and I have a little date with a siren.
 As long as this tuning fork is ringing, she can't.
 Yeah, I think it's "I love you".
 I love you, too.
 Hey, thanks.
 None. And that's what worries me.
 The all-powerful siren. Imprisoned by a fork.
 If this disrupts your psychic ability, then why is Damon still your puppet?
 Why are you doing this to him?
 No, actually. All I care about is how to save my brother.
 Will do? Present tense?
 Enough. Who is she? Patience, Stefan. I promise you'll find out soon enough.
 Yeah.
 How about we just focus on you and your sister?
 You're stalling. Who is she?
 So you beached the ship.
 Look, we don't have to be enemies. Damon and I had nothing to do with the Armory until you possessed him. If we're enemies, it's because you chose this path. I didn't ask for any of this.
 Or maybe there were no boars on the island. You kept luring ships into the rocks. Killing for provisions.
 Here's all you need to know. Whatever Damon and I have done to one another in the past, it has been forgiven. He is my brother, and there's nothing you can do that will ever change that.
 What did you do to me?
 Oh, so is this where you attack my psyche? Try to break me down?
 The boss?
 What are you talking about?
 You discovered? You're not the girl from the island, are you? You're the village girl.
 What, you expect me to have sympathy for you? After everything you've done?
 No.
 Seline is the other siren?
 Get out of my head. Now!
 What did you do to me?
 You confronted your sister. She turned you into a cannibal against your wishes.
 I don't know.
 Why are you still here? I was out cold, you were in my head. Why didn't you escape?
 There you go again. Old history.
 I'm both.
 Hell? As in, literal Hell. Come on. Just tell me the truth. Who's Cade? What is he?
 I don't believe you.
 Hell. The Devil. None of it exists.
 Stop making this about me. I'm trying to help my brother.
 No. That was almost 100 years ago. I'm not that person anymore.
 Maybe I do deserve it, but Damon doesn't, because I made him what he is. So, if it's my fault, damn me. Not him.
 I really hoped that when we put Sybil down, it'd break whatever control she had over him, but she still has ahold of him.
 Seline is the other siren?
 If this disrupts your psychic ability, then why is Damon still your puppet?
 Tyler deserved more than to be collateral damage in whatever game Sybil's playing with Damon.
 I'm at a loss with Damon. I don't know what to do with him anymore.
 Is that why you came home, Damon? To make empty threats?
 Look, even if we break Sybil's hold, once Damon realizes what he's done, what Elena will think of him, he may not recover.
 While we figure out how to save Damon from the sirens, we have to figure out how to save him from himself. We have to put him down.
 As long as we need to.
 It's for his own good. And it's the only way that we can protect ourselves.
 Got a text from Damon a little while ago. He wants to meet up at the carnival.
 I don't know. But this is my only chance, I don't know if I'll get another so I have to take it.
 No. I'm not putting you in any more danger, Caroline.
 I have to do this on my own.
 He might not forgive me after this. And I might lose him forever.
 Hey, what's going on?
 Hello, brother.
 I got to say, I'm surprised. Last time I saw you, you seemed pretty hell-bent on severing ties.
 Well, it's a little late to take it back. Even if Sybil made you do it.
 By turning off your humanity?
 You know I can help you. If you let me.
 You have to. You can't keep doing what you're doing.
 Because if we can't feel, then what's the point of being alive, huh?
 No. I'm not buying it. I can see your humanity trying to break through, Damon. Come home with me. I can help you be happy again.
 It'll take time and work. But I'll be there for you.
 Hey. I am your brother, and I love you. Just come home with me.
 I don't have any choice, you don't know what you're doing.
 I'm sorry.
 Thanks for coming. I thought we could give the funeral another shot.
 We're here to... honor Tyler.
 Look, we don't know what'll happen next to any of us. But we can't let that haunt us. We can't let that make us forget what we mean to one another. A few years ago, I sat on top of that Ferris wheel with Elena and I told her how important it was to appreciate these moments. Because moments are all we have. So in honor of Tyler and Elena, we need to keep creating moments like these. We need to remember to live.
 Wow. You know, I realized that I never said thank you.
 Well, hopefully you won't have to do that anymore.
 If this disrupts your psychic ability, then why is Damon still your puppet?
 We have to put him down. That's the only way that we can protect ourselves.
 Who's Cade?
 Hey. I compelled the sheriff to make this case a priority. Should bypass some red tape. Where to first?
 He's on the phone with Matt.
  I'll go put this in the car.
 What?
 Caroline, you can't be serious. The twins have been abducted by two sirens, and you expect me to just hang back?
 Right. Which is exactly why I should come with you.
 Shouldn't there be more chatter from your cop friends?
 Where the hell are they going?
 Sybil told me she was able to manipulate Damon by invading his subconscious. If you can't see or feel her, she must be in yours.
 I don't know, I've never gone deeper than the surface.
 Matt, I need you to pull up a list of all the diners in Oakwood.
 Because Sybil's at one of them, and she has no idea that we're onto her.
 Tell me you found them.
 Look, Sybil is mentally torturing him and I think my prying around his head is making it worse.
 Ric...
 Let me talk to Caroline.
 Just make sure she knows I'm doing everything I can.
 I can go inside his mind again but I don't know if that's a good idea.
 Where are the twins?
 I'm sorry.
 And you're going to be my wife and Ric is my friend and Damon is my brother. I have a chance to fix this for all of us, so that's exactly what I'm going to do.
 Don't do this, Damon.
 Why are you doing this?
 Where are the girls? I won't ask you again.
 I'll do it. Just let the girls go.
 I gave Damon what he promised me... an eternity of misery.
 It means I surrendered my immortal soul to Cade. I have to serve him the way the sirens did. Deliver the darkest souls to hell so I don't end up there myself.
 I know. I know. I'm sorry.
 Our day is tomorrow. It's my last day.
 Because my one condition was that I get to spend my last 24 hours of freedom... with you.
 Who's Cade? What is he?
 I'll do it. Just let the girls go.
 I surrendered my immortal soul to Cade. I have to serve him the way the sirens did and deliver the darkest souls to hell so I don't end up there myself. My one condition was that I get to spend my last 24 hours of freedom... with you.
 
 Yeah, but you've been planning this Christmas Eve dinner forever, so we... are going to do it.
 I think our last day of life as we know it should be a little bit less depressing than that, don't you? So, today, we are gonna do what people do on Christmas. We're gonna eat more than we should and we're gonna drink until our friends and family seem somewhat normal. That's what I want today to be.
 Yeah, well, uh, I take it you haven't spoken with Matt.
 Hey! I thought I heard you two. I have your Christmas present upstairs.
 Ric's gonna stay with the girls for awhile.
 Well, Ric's not exactly in a trusting mood right now and, uh... neither am I.
 What are you doing here?
 At midnight, I'm all yours, so until then, would you just leave me alone, okay?
 What's that?
 Cade?
 Not particularly, no.
 Caroline?
 Cade. Where are we?
 So, this is hell? My living room?
 What's there to discuss? My brother and I fetch bad guys for the rest of our existence and in exchange, you keep us out of hell. Seems pretty horrifically straightforward if you ask me.
 Just a Hail Mary pass since we're here. Why don't you let me out of this deal? I'm not the right person for you.
 Where is this? ... I worked here. I picked grapes. Pomegranates, I think.
 Christmas? I wasn't here on Christmas.
 Look, I know what damage I've to done to these people. I've been living with that guilt for a hundred years. But not on Christmas. I wouldn't do that...
 I don't remember doing this.
 Leave... or you'll go up there next.
 You can see inside my mind, can't you? It's horrible, isn't it? I know. Take me. I deserve it.
 She took the memory away.
 Made me believe I was worthy of a life.
 I will never... be that Ripper again. Not for you. Not anyone.
 Why are we here?
 Elena.
 This was from a chapter in my life when I was good. I loved her.
 That was never my intention. I tried to protect her.
 Well, I can't take that back, can I?
 But Elena is a good person. I thought you needed evil people.
 You've taken too much of my time.
 And if I refuse?
 And what if you don't have to be patient? What if I can get the job done... faster?
 I could become the Ripper that you want. I'd be more effective that way. I wouldn't be held back by my emotions.
 For a short time, yes. And then after, when it's over, you let me and my brother go. When I was the Ripper... I was one of a kind. No one can do what I do.
 Well, I think you're wrong.
 Where's Damon?
 Come with me.
 I'll tell you. It's good. But first...
 I needed at least one thing I planned for today to actually work. I love you.
 We made a deal. I serve him for a year, and then I'm done.
 Because what I'm going to do and how I'm gonna do it makes it worth it to him.
 Caroline, please don't, don't... don't make me say it right now. Just let me have this moment. 'Cause in seven minutes, Christmas is over, and everything changes so... let me be here, right now... with you.
 Aren't you light a passenger?
 Not yet.
 I'll do it. Just let the girls go. I could become the Ripper that you want.
 For a short time, yes.
 When it's over, you let me and my brother go. I made a deal. I serve him for a year and then I'm done.
 Actually, I asked for the job.
 I thought we were going for like, a... a veiled analogy.
 You've literally never said that before.
 Okay. He's just jealous because I'm better at finding new clients. For instance. Who would you say is the worst person in this room? Huh? Meg or Elizabeth? You both have said some pretty awful things. I'm sure that, given the right opportunity, one of them would make an evil choice.
 What about you? What if you had to pick one person to die? Who would it be? Meg or Elizabeth?
 What if it was between you and Meg? Would you want Meg to die?
 Answer the question honestly.
 What if both Meg and Elizabeth had to die, in order for you to live?
 Wow. I think I've heard enough.
 Cade can have him. These are mine.
 It's called self-control, Damon. No dripping blood equals no temptation. I'm doing it right this time. Heads will remain intact.
 You know, your lack of faith in me is really starting to get on my nerves.
 That's why it's called history. It won't repeat. I'm all good.
 What about her? Over there.
 All right, fine. Let's just go with the server then. She looks angry already.
 You want a challenge, huh? Yeah. Hmm. Let's go with that woman, right there.
 No. The doctor helping her.
 Manicured nails... Means she doesn't work with her hands. Medical pager means she's on call. Only in her 20s and already a doctor? Huh. Must have graduated early. Really thrown herself into her work. Why do you think that is, Damon?
 Or maybe, she's driven by something dark. Some sort of pain in her past.
 Those sound like some bettin' words to me, Damon.
 Well... Only one way to find out, right?
 Shh. Oh, my God. Is there a doctor here?
 Well, I got to sell your hospital stay with a little bit of actual weakness, right? I did some Internet stalking. So, it turns out that Tara's mom and dad were both killed in a car accident ten years ago. It was a hit-and-run. They never found the driver. I told you she was driven by something dark.
 Oh, my spidey-sense is doing just fine, thank you. Listen to this. Her parents were both organ donors and their untimely passing saved other people's lives. That's why Tara went into medicine.
 She even volunteers her time at an organ-transplant support group. That's a little morbid, if you ask me. Although actually, it's, uh... it's perfect.
 Well, I guess I always knew something like this would happen.
 It's just karma. He's made a lot of dark choices in his life. Hurt a lot of people along the way.
 You know, I can't help but think that maybe this is all happening for a reason. I was on an organ donor Web site today, and I saw a list of all these people... these really deserving people... just waiting in line for a transplant.
 Why not? I mean, I-I saw this one girl, she's all the way at the top of the list. Her name is Kassie Fowler.
 Her profile says she wants to go to developing countries and-and build wells and get clean water. It's not her fault that her kidneys are failing. So, what, Damon gets to waste his life and she's not able to live hers?
 Hmm. Even after everything that he's done?
 What if I told you that he caused your parents' death?
 Because you... need an opportunity. Here's what you believe.
 Damon is a drunk driver. Damon is the one who killed your parents.
 Cade never said I couldn't take a shortcut.
 What are you so pleased about? You're supposed to be on task.
 Mm. No one is just plain good.
 Oh, just upping your vervain intake.
I need to create a medical emergency in order for the rest of the game to play out.
  Damon, I work for the devil. I don't have to play fair.
 Oh. Sorry, Damon. You're too weak to convince her otherwise.
 No matter what you do, her parents will still be gone. Your mistakes can never be undone.
 So is your death. Think about how much good you would do for the people who actually deserve to live.
 His heart's already failing. Maybe we should just wait it out.
 I understand, I do. But here's what I can't stop thinking about. You fix Damon's heart, you get him back up on his feet again. Then he goes back to drinking. Then one night he gets behind the wheel, causes another accident. Someone else's parents die. Or maybe this time it's a couple of kids.
 I know, but we can judge the past. How many times does Damon have to show us who he really is before we actually believe him? I understand your struggle, I really do. Trying to be perfect for everyone when all you want to do is make a choice for yourself.
 Yes, it is, because you are in charge. So follow your instincts, and do what you think is right.
 That figures.
 Hi. I just wanted to say good-bye. I know you tried to help my brother.
 Oh, don't be. Joke's on you.
 What if I'm not? What if it was all a game, and I was just giving you a morality test?
 Either way, my brother's still dead.
 But he died from natural causes, right? You called me in after the fact, so nobody knows what you did on your own.
 No, no, no. I just wanted to see what you would do if I gave you the opportunity. And you lived up to your potential.
 Thought you'd be sleeping off a vervain hangover, Damon.
 Be quiet. Don't try to escape. You already failed the test.
 She's done evil things.
 You know, I gotta say, I'm disappointed.
 Now, I can see why you were confused.
 Missing something? I found this in your pocket. You've been carrying it around for weeks, haven't you?
 You sure about that? Ever since we hit the road, something's been off.
 No, no, no. Your sense of fun. Why do you think I picked Tara over here for our little game, hmm? She remind you of someone? Interest in medicine. Brown eyes, brown hair. Orphaned by tragedy. She reminds you of Elena. And so does this necklace. It triggers your conscience. It's holding you back, Damon.
 I think I figured it out. It's not that you're trying to screw things up.
 It's more submerged. It's more subconscious than that.
 Despite your best efforts, your humanity keeps flickering through because of this... little reminder.
 Reminders cause problems.
 And I don't believe you.
 You seem troubled. You're not enjoying our work.
 Fine, then prove me wrong. Prove that the past is behind us. Prove to me that you don't care.
 Almost. You forgetting something?
 Your humanity keeps flickering through because of this. Prove to me that you don't care.
 Speeding. He's yours if you want him.
 Suit yourself.
 Ah... You're distracted.
 Cade's work takes time. And this is how we pass it.
 Don't answer that.
 What are you doing? We work for Cade now. We're done with the Sirens.
 You know, maybe a trip to Mystic Falls... is exactly what we need.
 You know want to know why you're so distracted, Damon? It's because that woman is still in your head. Hmm?
 And we are going to burn her to the ground.
 As if you volunteering at this thing isn't a sad attempt to relive your glory days.
 You're right. I have no idea why that was such a dilemma.
 So what if I am?
 Who do I have to thank?
 I can find my own meals, thank you very much.
 Yes, which is why it's such a pain in the ass when you yank on my brother's supernatural leash.
 Elena. He's able to resist you because of this place. Miss Mystic Falls. You made a mistake by bringing him here. This stupid pageant is the day that Damon realized that he could take Elena from me. In his mind, this place, this event, was the beginning of their vomit-inducing love story.
 Take it from me, Elena Gilbert never really goes away.
 Well, we remind Damon of what really happened at Miss Mystic Falls.
 You didn't hand over that stupid ball Sybil wants...
 Well, because fighting Sybil is keeping you from being the brother that I want.
 No, that's not what I mean, Damon. You know, when we set out on the road together, I really thought it would make us brothers again. But we can't seem to go anywhere without the past coming back to haunt us.
 This place. The memories. Dancing with Elena, ratting me out for drinking out of blood bags.
 But you could have helped me in my time of need. Instead, you were standing right here, falling for Elena as she walked down those stairs. You think this is where your love story began, but the truth is, Damon, Elena never would have looked at you twice if I had been there that day.
 Really? Mm-hmm.
 Then why... are you still holding onto this? Hmm? You know, when I gave this to Elena, it was to protect her from you.
 Damaged? You're welcome.
 May I?
 There you are. I just wanted to let you know that I'm hitting the road. Alone.
 I finally admitted to myself that I'm never gonna have the brother that I want. There's just too much history.
 Hmm. Sybil isn't the woman that I was referring to.
 Oh, yes, she is. She's in your head, more powerful than Sybil, manipulating your every move.
 Pretty much. Yeah.
 No, I'm choosing myself over everyone else. I was made for Cade's work. And, true to form, the minute I become my best self, you have to go ahead and ruin it. Well, I'm not gonna let you drag me down with you. Not this time.
 I see we're down to our finalists. You may never win a beauty pageant again, but here's a little consolation prize. Whatever that is. You can go now. I know you're not gonna want to see this.
 Why? You knew all along I'd have to kill people for Cade.
 Exactly. Such exemplary young women. They have no idea that the world is out to crush them.
 Don't worry, she'll be back.
 Well, I gave each one of these promising young women a little taste of my blood.
 You've inspired me, Caroline. Who would have thought that a Miss Mystic Falls would become engaged to a servant of Cade? Look in the mirror. Vampirism is a one-way path to hell.
 No. But we're engaged, Caroline. That means we're in this together. You're not just an innocent bystander if you let me kill for Cade. So unless you want to call the whole thing off, blood is on your hands, too.
 See? You're good at this killing thing.
 Thought you'd have run for the hills by now.
 You don't get it, do you? I'm not in this for a year. I'm in this until I decide that I'm done. Three years, ten years. Cade was right. This is fun. I don't want to quit.
 You knew all along I'd have to kill people for Cade.
 Exactly.
 Aren't you a little young to be drinking?
 It's Violet, right? Just relax. Everything's gonna to be okay.
 You're angry. I get it, you feel like I forced you into this. Believe me, I can relate. My brother forced me into making a deal with the devil, so that I would turn innocent girls like you into monsters... so they'd do terrible things like this.
 But life isn't fair, Violet. See, I gave you a choice. You didn't have to kill these people, but you did. You chose to feed. And that makes you the perfect offering for Cade.
 It's a little hard to explain. Probably easier if I just show you.
 Hey, maybe I can help. Sorry I was eavesdropping.
 Hello, Caroline.
 I made a mistake. I'm here to convince you to marry me.
 Nah, honestly I'm just here because when you killed me last night. Cade and I had a little chat and it turns out Hell needs more souls than I've been providing and it's time for Damon to do his part. Just wake Damon up so he can earn his keep and we're good.
 More like failing. You do know what he's doing, right? Damon's humanity is on which means he's all emo and afraid of owning up to what he did when it was off. When we were kids, he used to hide out every time he did something wrong until I'd find him and tell him everything was gonna be okay. So. all you need to do is find out where he's hiding in there and do the exact same thing. By the way, why are you helping them?
 Well, I'll see what I can do. In the meantime, fix this.
 Can't let you do that Matt. Oh, and Ripper tip, if you're plotting to murder someone you should probably keep a lower profile.
 Since about an hour ago when I decided I needed that bell.
 Long story short, Cade needs more souls and your sister's better at making deals than you are.
 Do tell.
 And then I said that sounds too good to be true and Seline said 'follow me' and now you're all caught up.
 Sounds dangerous. I like it.
 That siren is evil to the core.
 Aren't I? Because it's caused me nothing but trouble and the emotional hold it has over Damon is worse than a Hallmark card.
 Oh, yes, you are, Matt. And when you do cause the deaths of all these innocent people I get to mark your do-gooder soul for Cade. It's a win-win.
 I'm sorry, who are you again?
 Pretty badly. So here's the deal. The choice is yours, Matt but you have to follow your heart.
 It means that if you don't want to ring that bell, you have to forgive Damon for killing your sister. And if you can't then you have to ring that bell twelve times by the top of the hour. No excuses. See ya, Matt.
 Just so we're clear, you calling me isn't why I'm here. I'm on a tight schedule so please, no talking.
 Work in progress. Any luck with my brother?
 If this is some kind of trick...
 Seriously, Damon, a graveyard? Could your subconscious be any more generic? That was a joke. Look, I just wanted to drop in, to let you know we're cool. Whatever you think you did to me, whatever's holding you back, it's fine. Why don't you just get your ass out here and go back to work?
 Sweet gargoyle, bro.
 Why don't we just cut to the chase, huh? I'm here to forgive you, Damon
 Okay, then. Enlighten me.
 You're kidding me, right. Think of all the ways you have ruined my life for the last century, including the fact that I am working for Cade right now because of you and you seriously believe that you're the one who should be forgiving me.
 I have nothing to apologise for.
 Shut up!
 Why aren't you healing?
 See, about that. You wanna forgive me for something bad, Damon? Well, how about this. I'm about to burn Mystic Falls to the ground.
 Hell is what I'm talking about. So before that beautiful brass bell rings, forgive me Damon. I dare you. And while you're at it, forgive me for coming here and trying to save you. Forgive me, for having the tiniest shred of guilt about leaving you to die with everyone else, for not seeing that the only way to get rid of you is to let you go up in flames with the rest of the damn town.
 Yeah, sorry. That was my bad. Oh, c'mon, don't look like that at me, Caroline. This is what you wanted, right? Til death do us part.
 Wow, you really can't take a hint.
 Then why are you here?
 Oh, yes, you are, Matt.
 I'm about to burn Mystic Falls to the ground.
 Don't care.
 Oh, God, when you say things like that, it really makes me regret not destroying Mystic Falls with hellfire. Maybe Seline'll ring that bell again and put me out of my misery.
 Yeah, except for the fact that we made a deal with the devil. You should be out dropping bodies and keeping our numbers up, Damon.
 Sorry, I fell asleep.
 Starting with your humanity switch. When did you become such a nag? Maybe you've been hanging out with my ex-fiancÃ©e too much. I'm surprised she's not here with you right now. Telling you all the things you're doing wrong.
 Boy. These roads had me completely turned around. Never been so happy to find a gas station in my life.
 Sure does. It's partly my fault. I was driving while distracted. Thinking about work. Not that I'm complaining. I love what I do. Deadlines can get kind of stressful, though. Oh, it's probably because of who I'm working for. You ever get the feeling that your boss can read your mind?
 Ooh, that's smart. That's what I want to do. Go solo and ditch this partnership that's been dragging me down for years. Of course, I'd still have to report to the guy at the top of the food chain. You know. The one who can read my mind. You know. The one who can read my mind.
 To be clear, he is an actual psychic. He told me where to find you. That work deadline I was telling you about? 
 You know, it is so refreshing to know that whatever you say will not bother me.
 Same reason people channel surf when they're bored. Just passing time while my new friend fills out the paperwork.
 Yep. She had everything messengered over from the county clerk's office, and I will be on my way as soon as she signs on the last dotted line.
 Congratulations. You are about to become a proud owner of Bonnie Bennett's safe house.
 One more thing. Will you do me a favor and invite me in?
 Well, I'm not on my way to Brooklyn. Elena is in upstate New York.
 That's where Bonnie hid her.
 Damon, we work for a psychic. Did you forget? Cade told me he met Bonnie this morning at a coffee shop and read her mind. That's where he saw the address of the safe house. It wasn't too difficult to track down her realtor. Although, that title deed paperwork did take forever.
 Let me guess. You're gonna appeal to my humanity and my brotherly bond. 'Think about Elena.' Blah, blah, blah. You don't have to think about anything, just turn around. I'll meet you wherever you want. Yeah? And then what?
 I am taking it out on you. I'm on my way to murder Elena.
 In fact, Waze says I'll be there in five minutes. 
 When Cade first suggested this idea, I was like, 'God, why didn't I think of that?' Oh, I know why. Because I've been too busy taking care of my brother.
 No, you won't, Damon. You're not capable of it, but you'll keep trying to interfere with everything as long as we're connected through her. That is why I want Elena gone.
 That's exactly my point. I want to cause her death so you can blame me for it... 
 Listen to yourself. You are pathetic. She's the root of all your problems, and therefore, mine. I mean, she's still coming between us, which is insane if you really think about it because, to be honest with you, in the grand scheme of things, she's really not that special. She's just a stupid girl. She's a stupid human girl who will be so easy to kill.
 She's already in her coffin, prepped and ready to go. I'm thinking something symbolic. Maybe find a bathtub to drown her in. Full circle kind of thing.
 Oh, yes, I can and I will... and I can't wait.
 Really? 
 What do you care what happens to Elena, huh? In a minute, you're gonna be dead, anyway.
 Elena's in upstate New York. That's where Bonnie hid her. Leave Elena out of this.
 Why do you care what happens to Elena? You're gonna be dead anyway.
 I'm here.
 Bonnie... she must be... I don't even know what to say. I don't know how I can... Every time I close my eyes, I see it play out over and over again in my head. And every time I open them, I see Enzo's blood on my hands.
 I can't do that.
 No. I can't face you, and I can't face Bonnie. 
 So who's Olivia Hayden?
 This is me.
 And he's gonna expect me to continue. I made a deal.
 What do you mean?
 I forced that girl's mother to change the deed to Bonnieâ€™s house. But I left her for dead in the trunk of a car. They won't find that body for weeks.
 Don't know. Maybe. It'll be dark soon.
 Yeah? And then what? You can compel away all the evidence of what I've done. Doesn't change the fact that I did it. I can't just forget about that and go cake-tasting.
 Look, I don't know what to think. I don't know how to deal with what I want or what I thought I was gonna have. I don't know what to do. There.
 But for how much longer? Let's go.
 KAREN? Hey, you're gonna be okay. 
  No, no. It's okay. I'm here to help.
 It's okay, I'm here to help you. CAROLINE, she's here! 
 No, no, no, no. Save her. Save her. Now. 
 Where's Karen? Where is she?
 Caroline, it doesn't matter. Today, tomorrow... I know where I'm going and I deserve it.
 Yes, I do.
 Doesn't matter. It's just one person.
 Look, um... I know it wasn't about the wedding. I didn't mean that.
 I just have no idea how to make this right.
 Uh, it... hurts. Definitely hurts.
  It's a good thing that wasn't funny, otherwise I'd be, uh... 
 I'm gonna have to pass. I... I just came home to change before I go to Bonnieâ€™s. I spent the last hour trying to... figure out what I was gonna say to her.
 Nothing. Mm, nothing to say. If I can't figure out a way to forgive myself, I can't expect her to.
 Well, regardless of how that goes, I just wanted to say thank you... for saving my life.
 Still, it gave me the chance to... undo all the damage that I've done.
 I just came home to change before I go to Bonnie's. Spent the last hour trying to figure out what I was gonna say to her. If I can't figure out a way to forgive myself, I can't expect her to.
 Bonnie.
 I understand. But I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't try.
 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
 And I will spend the rest of my human life living with that guilt. Looking for ways to make up for my actions. I'm leaving town. I know it may not mean much to you but I'll be doing everything I can to atone.
 Nope, I'll manage.
 Look, you're not gonna talk me out of leaving town so you might as well just save your breath.
 What? How?
 What're you talking about? Kai's dead.
 And he turned her over to Cade?
 In exchange for Elena.
 Yelp, actually. CobraKai1972 wrote  "grunge music selection weak, drinks even weaker. Then 30 minutes later, drinks getting better, love this place, microphone emoji, fireball emoji."
 Actually, I'm here for what you didn't give Cade.
 You want an insurance policy? How about this. You give me the dagger and I'll kill him.
 Because you're afraid of him. And I'm not.
 You can't siphon me. I'm human.
 Damon.
 
 We didn't know what to do with him. I don't even know if he can be killed or whatever it is you do to a person who's already dead. All I know is we have a way to eliminate Cade and right now that's the priority.
 And as soon as you hear from me or Damon you can do whatever you want with him. Look, if anyone deserves to send him back to Hell, it's you. But first I need your help.
 Because your name's not Maxwell or Donovan.
 Why the hell did Cade wanna meet here?
 Nope. I don't.
 Look, me leaving Mystic Falls is the best thing for her.
 I can't atone for my mistakes if I keep making them. I love her. I don't wanna drag her down with me.
 You're my brother. But let's be clear, this about more than just you and me. I'm the one who compelled Matt Donovan to ring that bell. Cade is free because of me. And that's why I have to kill him.
 Yeah, well, it is now. Kai said that killing Cade'll destroy Hell too.
 What I believe is I have to give it a shot, Damon. With or without you.
 I know it's a long shot.
 I'm sorry, Damon. I have to do this.
 Thought you might feel that way.
 Cade. Cade! 
 Well I'm the one you get.
 Well, right this second, not very good. 
 Die.
 Damon. You know what to do.
 Fine. Then I will. Cade. Take me.
 No, Damon. Please don't do this.
 Damon, don't.
 No, Damon.
 No!
 Bonnie.
 The magic was too much for her.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 Don't do this. Bonnie. Come on, Bonnie.
 Hey.
 There has to be something.
 There's got to be something we're missing.
 Earlier, Bonnie's heart stopped.She said she saw Elena.
 You got to be kidding me. Katherine.
 Her physical body. Where is it?
 We're running out of time. We have to find Elena. Let's go.
 
 That's my next stop.
 Okay.
 Come on, let's get you out of here. 
 I'm fine, but she's trapped. We're running out of time. You have to get Katherine to break the spell.
 It's not just Elena.
 I need to talk to Damon.
 No. But I have to try.
 No. I can do it alone. You get to safety. Family first.
 If I want to convince Damon I have to move fast, and I can't do that unless I know you're safe.
 He's my brother.
 I love you so much.
 
 Absolutely. Why? Do you have something?
 Tell me what I need to do.
 No, he's not. 
 I'm not the one who's going to get out of here, Damon. You are.
 Said the martyr.
 Somebody needs to stay here to make sure she's actually in hell when it's destroyed.
 You can tell her yourself. I need to do this, Damon. I owe it to Bonnie and Enzo. I owe it to a lot of people.
 Yes, you are.
 You keep saying that, but you're wrong. We're all responsible for our own actions. Every drop of blood that I've spilled, I am accountable for.
 Damon, I'm human. In sixty years I'm gonna be old, I'm gonna be dead. You have quite literally an eternity with Elena ahead of you.
 Do you think I want this? I just got married. My wife is out there waiting for me to come home to her. In the nearly two centuries since I made you become a vampire, I have fought to turn you into the man who deserves the happiness that's out there right now.
 Just let me do this for you.
 Then let me do this for me. Please.
 I love you too.
 No, Damon, don't.
 Hi.
 I don't know about Bonnie, but Damon... Damon wanted to sacrifice everything, to save you. To save this town. He was ready. I'm human now. He compelled me to leave. 
 I gave him my blood. The cure.
 Without the cure I'd start to age. I'd be dead soon enough.
 He's okay.
 I did what I had to do.
 Burn in hell. 
 Tonight I saw a side of Damon that I hadn't seen in a while. The older brother I looked up to. The son who enlisted in the Civil War to please his father. The Damon I knew when I was a boy. I wanted that Damon to live. And I wanted you to have an opportunity to get to know him. He's the better man. He's the right man. 
 I was feeling epic.
 One day when you wake up, tell Caroline I heard her and I will love her forever too.
 Damon.
