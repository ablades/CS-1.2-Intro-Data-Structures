 So Grams is telling me I'm psychic. Our ancestors were from Salem, witches and all that, I know, crazy, but she's going on and on about it, and I'm like, put this woman in a home already! But then I started thinking, I predicted Obama and I predicted Heath Ledger, and I still think Florida will break off and turn into little resort islands...Elena! Back in the car.
 That I'm psychic now.
 I see...
 What was that?! Oh, my god! Elena, are you okay?
 It was like a bird or something. It came out of nowhere.
 I predict this year is going to be kick ass. And I predict all the sad and dark times are over and you are going to be beyond happy.
 Major lack of male real estate. Look at the shower curtain on Kelly Beech. She looks like a hot — can I still say "tranny mess"?
 Ahh, find a man, coin a phrase. It's a busy year.
 That's not hate. That's "you dumped me, but I'm too cool to show it, but secretly I'm listening to Air Supply's greatest hits."
 OK! Bye!
 I'm not going to say anything.
 Hold up. Who's this?
 It's a hot back.
 I'm sensing Seattle, and he plays the guitar.
 Pretty much.
 Please be hot.
 You got all of that in one day?
 Her mom and dad died. How do you think? She's putting on a good face, but it's only been four months.
 Oh, no. So not getting in the middle. You pick up the phone and call her.
 Give it more time, Matt.
 Parents?
 It's a back to school thing at the falls.
 Of course she is.
 Um...a lot? I'm not sure. Like a whole lot.
 Just admit it, Elena.
 He has that romance novel stare.
 So where is he?
 Right, I forgot. Okay, so give me a sec. Grams says I have to concentrate.
 That was weird. When I touched you, I saw a crow.
 A crow. There was fog, a man. I'm drunk. It's the drinking. There's nothing psychic about it. Yeah? Ok, I'm gonna get a refill.
 Hey. We're gonna go to Mainline Coffee, wait for news.
 Elena, there's no way I'm psychic. I know that. But whatever I saw, or I think I saw, I have this feeling...
 That it's just the beginning.
 Are you sober yet?
 Keep drinking. I gotta get you home. I gotta get me home.
 I'm not touching that.
 It's not a competition, Caroline.
 Technically, Grams says I'm a witch. My ancestors were these really cool Salem witch chicks or something. Grams tried to explain it all, but she was looped on the liquor so I kinda tuned out. Crazy family, yes. Witches? I don't think so.
 I didn't see him, you did. Why didn't you just talk to him?
 Well, I was talking to Grams, and she said the comet is a sign of impending doom. The last time it passed over Mystic Falls, there was lots of death. So much blood and carnage, it created a bed of paranormal activity.
 Where are you going?
 Tonight, night of the comet! Would you like a program?
 Would you like a program? He didn't call, huh?
 That's an important milestone in any relationship.
 When is it ever right?
 Who is?
 Is that what you're calling it?
 All I'm hearing is reasons why you can't.
 We'll check the back.
 Yeah.
 Hi.
 I think she went home. I'm gonna give you Elena's cell number and her email. She is big on texting, and you can tell her..."I said so".
 What happened to you? That's so rude. I'm sorry. Excuse me.
 I'm not saying don't date the guy. I'm just saying take it slow.
 Now I'm saying take it slow.
 It's not an about-face. You're single for the first time in your entire high school career. It's the perfect time to play the field.
 It's stupid.
 What?
 I accidentally touched Stefan. And I got a really bad feeling.
 It was bad bad!
 You know what? I'm just concerned. This is me expressing concern about my best friend's new boyfriend.
 Hey, um, I gotta find Caroline. She's not answering her phone. So I'll see you guys later.
 Oh, my God! You're here!
 I am?
 Tonight's no good. Have you seen Caroline? I texted her like a hundred times.
 Fine. I'll go.
 Seriously, where is Caroline?
 I'll try her again.
 Oh, my God. That must be the mystery guy from the grill.
 Salvatore, as in Stefan?!
 You explain it. Last night, I'm watching Nine-o, a commercial breaks come on and I'm like, I bet it's that phone commercial. And sure enough, it's that guy and the girl with the bench, he flies to Paris and he flies back. They take a picture.
 Fine. Well, how about this? Today I'm obsessed with numbers. 3 numbers. I keep seeing 8, 14, and 22. How weird is that?
 She's just gonna say it's because I'm a witch. I don't want to be a witch. Do you want to be a witch?
 And putting it in a nice bowl isn't fooling anybody.
 Middle drawer on your left.
 Yeah, that's it.
 Birthday candles.
 Yeah, I heard.
 Um, divorced. No mom. Live with my dad.
 Cool isn't the word I'd use.
 My family came by way of Salem.
 Yeah.
 Really? Why?
 Yeah, they are.
 I'll work with her. She'll get it.
 Hey. Need some help?
 Hey! Where you been?
 Of course. What is it?
 You know what, forget I said that. Your little dinner party plot totally won me over.
 It wasn't clear like a picture. Like today, I keep seeing those same numbers I told you about...8, 14, 22.
 When I touched Stefan, it was a feeling. And it vibrated through me, and it was cold, and it...
 It was death. It's what I imagine death to be like.
 You're taking Damon to the founder's party? What about me?
 She's asking Stefan.
 Gee, thanks. What about your mom? Is she okay with you bringing Damon?
 He's older sexy danger guy.
 No more witch jokes, okay? That whole Mr. Tanner prediction thing has me freaked.
 Like...?
 Caroline Forbes, when have you ever kept a secret in your life?
 No.
 Delicate flower vs. naughty vixen.
 Look at you, getting all pretty for your date. You seem happy-ish.
 What if I tell you in the morning? I don't want to ruin the night.
 Okay, but it has to go in the vault, because Caroline will kill me if it gets back to Damon that she squealed. Apparently Stefan has a very interesting back story.
 Do you know what happened with his ex-girlfriend Katherine?
 Yeah, they both dated her, only she chose Damon. And that drove Stefan mad, so he did horrible things to try and break them up. He manipulated Katherine. He filled her head with all these lies until finally it worked, and she turned against Damon.
 I just wanted you to know.
 Unless he's a calculating, manipulative liar. That is your business.
 Yeah? How do you know?
 What's wrong?
 This is my fault. I planted doubt. I'm a doubt planter.
 Bitch.
 Why would you do that?
 Um...nothing. What's this?
 It's ugly.
 She's in denial.
 Hey. You know, I gotta go. Be somewhere right now.
 uh-uh, no. None of that tortured pining stuff.
 Mm-hmm. Oh. Tiki. this one's yours.
 You don't have to be rude.
 What?
 It's a car wash. By definition, the pavement's clean.
 And I'm doing this why?
 What just happened?
 Did I do this?
 Nobody else saw, did they? Don't tell anybody. Please.
 I don't know what's happening to me.
 Oh, Grams.
 Was our family burned in the witch trials?
 How did we end up in Mystic Falls?
 Grams, everybody knows you're a witch.
 Where's the witchcraft? I mean, you've been talking history for 2 days. I wanna get to the fun part.
 Seriously?
 Hey, isn't this the one you got from Damon?
 I was with Grams all weekend. I haven't talked to her. Maybe she's with Stefan.
 Don't be bitter. It provokes wrinkles.
 No way. Last year I was hung over until Thanksgiving.
 Do yourself a favor, Damon, and don't ask me about Caroline.
 Just stay away from her.
 From a friend.
 Not anymore.
 I'm not giving it to you. I'll give it to Caroline, and she can give it to you if she feels like it.
 I did something. I don't know. It came from my necklace.
 It's part of my costume. It's a piece of junk.
 Dad doesn't like it when I stay here too much.
 He's right.
 I gotta give it back to Caroline. It doesn't belong to me.
 Emily was your ancestor too, why don't you wear it?
 I just wish it was prettier.
 You up?
 Why haven't you called me back?
 Are you gonna stay in there forever?
 Move over. 
 Can I get a one-line version so I can at least pretend to be helpful?
 I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Right stupid question. I know I've been kind of MIA when you need me the most. I suck.
 Just remember you asked for it.
 Be patient.
 I need to swear you to secrecy.
 Swear, 'cause I'm not supposed to be showing you this.
 There's no windows open, right?
 There's no fan. No air conditioning.
 Grams just showed me this. You're gonna love it. You ready?
 It's true Elena. Everything my Grams told me. It's impossible and it's true. I'm a witch.
 It's Weird huh? After all This times joking about being psychic. I really am a witch. You don't think I'm a freak now, do you?
 You're my best friend. I can't keep secrets from you.
 Why? You said you hated it.
 I can't give it back to you.
 I'm sorry Caroline, I can't.
 I thought you said it was Damon's.
 So he's the one who really wants it back.
 You were really gonna pull it from my neck. What the hell is wrong with you? 
 Caroline.
 Don't do that, let me explain.
 Who said that to you?
 You know that not true. Don't let him treat you like that.
 Hello?
 Who are you?
 Where am I?
 
 
 And then, I ended up at the remains of the old Fell's church before I woke up back in the woods.
 Mhm. Do you believe in ghosts?
 Because i think I'm being haunted.
 Grams said she was a powerful witch back in the Civil War days, and that this medallion was hers. A witch's talisman.
 I think she's using it to communicate with me.
 I can't call her. She's gonna tell me to embrace it. I don't want to embrace it, I want it to stop.
 
 You can't have it.
 I don't want your help.
 Just leave me alone or I swear 
 
 He's bad news, Elena. He really scared me.
 I'm trying! He just keeps showing up.
 Now I am. All my problems were because of that thing. I can't believe I didn't do that sooner.
 Grams isn't the one being haunted by a hundred and fifty-year-old ghost, is she?
 
 I know it sounds crazy, but the necklace was giving me nightmares. I had to get rid of it.
 Mine's in my bag.
 What?
 I'm not lying to you, Caroline. I swear.
 Emily.
 The ghost.
 
 Yes it is. I can't talk to you. You don't listen.
 I'm a witch.
 See? That's what I'm talking about. I'm trying to tell you something. You don't even hear it.
 
 What are we doing?
 Emily, you there?
 Fine, geez. Emily. I call on you. I know you have a message. I'm here to listen.
 It's just the air conditioning.
 See? It's not working. 
 You guys, the necklace. It's gone.
 Guys...
 I don't understand, Elena, what happened to me? He attacked me, and his face was like...
 I'm fine. It's just this blood. I don't...
 What's going on, Elena?
 They’ve been hanging out.
 She needs someone nice like him, as opposed to a homicidal vampire like Damon.
 I’m freaked out. Damon attacked me. I could be dead right now. But I'm also grateful.
 To Stefan. He saved my life and...Have you seen him?
 He wouldn’t leave without saying goodbye.
 So, what are you gonna do?
 Maybe it’s for the best.
 I mean, what kind of future could you have had with him, even if he stayed?
 No, I swear.
 Stefan...
 Hi.
 I'm fine. It's all fine.
 Are you back in school?
 Stefan, look, I know Elena's okay with all of this, and I appreciate what you did to help me. But I'm not really ready to dive into it with you just yet.
 How do you know I can do this?
 I'm still new at it.
 Okay. All right.
 There's nothing. Nothing's happening. Usually there's an image or...tell me if anyone's looking.
 Something's wrong.
 With me. There's something wrong with me. 
 Thank God you're back.
 My powers are gone, Grams. I can't do anything, even when I concentrate. And there's nothing in in any of these books that can tell me how to get them back.
 I can't.
 I have to. I'm sorry. I promised. Please, help me.
 Clear what out?
 
 Ow. Hello?! Anybody?! Ahh!
 Come on, phone! Great! Great.
 
 Stefan? 
 How?
 
 How did you know where I was?
 I heard them...down there...behind the door. 
 But if they have blood...
 
 I can't believe you're adopted. I never saw that coming.
 Which is why you should ask Jenna.
 First of all, the Elena I know would always want the real truth, good or bad.
 You just found out your boyfriend is a 
 Ok, I'll pay the bill.
 Bye.
 What do you want from me?
 You tried to kill me.
 You know, I can start fires with my mind. Fires kill vampires, right? 
 Thank you.
 Wait. You remember me?
 No, sorry. I didn't...I didn't mean that. I just—I didn't know you knew me.
 What's Damon doing here?
 
 I'm out of here.
 Let's sit up there.
 Don't rain on my hot-guy parade.
 He's hot.
 Ah, you're just feeling sorry for yourself. Go and talk to him. Be bold and fearless.
 You're right.
 Hi.
 I'm proving something to my friend.
 That you don't have to sit around and wait for a guy to come up to you.
 Does that mean you want me to?
 
 No. You were great.
 Well, first mistake, Metallica karaoke?
 The woman with the tattoos loved you.
 Next time?
 They're all doing their own thing. Caroline's at her dad's, Elena's with her boyfriend.
 Yeah.
 She's my best friend.
 Oh. Elena and I are bonded for life. I can't imagine it any other way.
 She's my sister. I mean, I'd die for her.
 It's going great. He's a perfect gentleman.
 I know! Boring, huh? I just want to grab him and lay one on him.
 'Cause I'm a chicken.
 
 This.
 Nothing. Sorry. I just should have waited until the end of the night to do that.
 
 I was going to say let's have some more coffee, get a caffeine buzz, and, I don't know, go out and do something crazy.
 Like anything.
 I'm going to run to the restroom.
 All right.
 Elena?
 My head...
 Oh my god! Ben is a-!
 I'm so stupid!
 What's going on? Why are we here?
 Spell book?
 Why didn't I know about any of this?
 Come to what?
 No way!
 You're wasting your time. I'm not gonna help you.
 Hey. Can I have a sip?
 Don't hurt her!
 Yep. We can die.
 How did you know where we were?
 I'm sorry. About all of this.
 No! He doesn't deserve to get what he wants.
 What is that?
 I guess so.
 Water.
 We're ready.
 It worked!
 Hey, you're not going in there!
 Why did you let her go in?
 Damon took her inside.
 Stefan! 
 No. Here. 
 You said it yourself, many things can fuel a witches power. Help me or I'll do it alone.
 Elena, Stefan...
 It's gonna be okay. We'll fix it.
 The spell's still up. We can't get them out yet.
 Oh my God. I can't!
 Hey, let me help you.
 It was a big spell, Grams. I could tell it took a lot out of you.
 Here you go, Grams.
 Grams?
 Grams! Grams, wake up! Grams! Grams! 
 Help! Wake up! She's not breathing! She's just not breathing! Please, wake up!
 I'm gonna fix it! It's okay, I can fix this!
 No! No! I can fix it! Grams, I can fix this!
 Sorry I'm late.
 Hey.
 We're dealing, it's been hard.
 Yeah, I just had so much to deal with after Grams' funeral and, honestly after you told me the tomb spell failed I just didn't really want to come back.
 I understand why. I just...shouldn't know.
 Better. Better. You know, glad to be back and trying to keep myself busy.
 Her mom is the one who wanted her to enter.
 Very nice, very sensitive.
 It's okay, I get it, you want to win.
 We only have 30 minutes for rehearsal.
 It not worth talking about.
 Listen, Elena, I can't just pretend that everything's okay. Everything my Grams did was to protect us from those vampires in the tomb. And now they're out which means she died for nothing.
 That's just did, there's nothing you can do. I blame him, Elena, him and Damon and I'm not gonna put you in a situation where you have to choose sides. I'm just having a hard time with it, okay?
 Is she gonna be okay?
 There's nothing to talk about.
 I told you I wasn't gonna make you choose but I need to make the choice for myself. Please just leave me alone.
 Alright, show me.
 Ew. Okay! So, what are we doing?
 Gone with the Wind?
 You channel Scarlett, daily.
 I don't know.
 What do you mean?
 It's nothing.
 I can't talk about it, Caroline, I'm sorry.
 Hey. I couldn't sleep last night. You were obviously upset about something and I just walked away. It's not me. That can't be us. You're my friend, Elena. If you need me I'm here for you and I'm sorry I couldn't show you that yesterday.
 Oh. Was it...Are you okay?
 Hey! Thanks for meeting me. I wanted you to see this.
 I've been going through it since Grams died. Check this out.
 Yeah, according to Emily, Johnathan Gilbert never actually succeeded in inventing anything. Emily secretly spelled them all with magic. Compass, rings and the mystery device you told me about.
 Emily pledged her loyalty to Katherine. But she couldn't stand by and watch innocent people get killed. This was the only way she could think of to help. To let Johnathan Gilbert believe that he'd actually invented these devices.
 Are you sure this is what Isobel wants?
 This is a weapon. Against vampires.
 Where is the device?
 I can remove the original spell.
 I've been practicing.
 What's your favorite book?
 Name a book, any book.
 You're right, you can't trust me.
 Done.
 I did something bad, Caroline, and I lied about it.
 To Elena. I pretended to do something I didn't really do.
 I couldn't do what she wanted me to do. It wasn't right. Grams would have never done it, so I couldn't either. But when Elena finds out, she's never gonna forgive me.
 Say cheese!
 What do you want?
 Away from you.
 Just leave me alone!
 I did it for Elena.
 I'm sorry.
 Hey, you can't go in there!
 The fire will take you out.
 Elena, you can't go in there!
 I'm sorry I lied to you.
 Ex spiritum intacullum, in terrum incendium, fes matos salvis adisdum!
 Hey.
 I was looking for you actually.
 Elena is my best friend, and because she loves you, I couldn't let you or Damon die in that fire.
 I do...but I hope you know that things have to change. Damon has to change.
 We both want to protect the people we care about. The difference is, for you, Damon is one of them. You saw what I was able to do tonight. I know who I am now, and if Damon spills so much as one drop of innocent blood, I'll take him down. Even if I have to take you with him.
 Let's hope it doesn't.
 How is Caroline?
 What happened?
 A noise?
 She's weak. They don't know if she's going to make it.
 No, I don't.
 Well, I can take down a vampire, that spell was easy to learn.
 Do it. This is Caroline. We can't let her die. Do it.
 No. But you'll do it anyway. For Elena.
 You've been here all night?
 No one else?
 How is Caroline today?
 Sorry.
 I'm just happy you're okay.
 We love you.
 Did you know the Gilbert device affected Tyler Lockwood?
 Don't you want to know why?
 She's much better.
 No, you're welcome.
 You live to see another day.
 Doesn't undo the bad. I know what you are Damon, you might have Elena and the sheriff and everybody else fooled but not me. One wrong move and I'm gonna take you out.
 Oh, I'm sorry, you were saying?
 Oh my god! Damon drives me crazy. He's walking around like he's some kind of hero for healing Caroline when it's his fault all of this happened in the first place.
 Okay, better. Hateful Damon moment over.
 I've got to find Tyler and pay my respects. I'll be back.
 Elena? Where are you?
 I know who you are.
 Elena!
 Katherine looked just like you, it was freakish.
 Your vampire ancestor and she didn't just resemble you like a family member would. She was you.
 How do you know she's not still out there pretending to be you?
 Have you talk to Damon since he killed Jeremy or tried to kill Jeremy?
 Okay, I'm sorry, I'll focus. We have to make Caroline proud or she will kill us. I don't know how she does all of this.
 Obviously. (They laugh.)
 The ring toss is out of Bart and Homer dolls and Team Jacob T's.
 Hey, all good Elena, take a beat, look around. This is a huge success.
 Go figure.
 What do you know about karaoke speakers?
 Okay, come on.
 What happened?
 She almost died, it's bound to mess with her head. Plus, she's Caroline.
 Caroline?
 No, you're not; you can't be. (She touches her and is horrified by the truth.)
 Oh, god!
 I can't believe this is happening.
 I told you what would happen if anyone else got hurt.
 Everything that happens is his fault, Elena.
 Why... Why did you stop me?!
 I don't know how to make a day-walking ring.
 That doesn't mean I can cast the spell.
 Caroline killed someone, Stefan. I can't make it easier for her to do it again.
 And how do you know she won't hurt anyone else?
 I don't know if I can trust her, not with this.
 Hey, if you don't want it...
 Now is the part where I explain the rules. The witch who spells the ring has the power to de-spell it so if you ever do anything to hurt anyone...
 You are a vampire that mean the urge to kill is a part of who you are. The minute you let it take over, I will stop you.
 I can't ignore what happened, okay? If you want to be friends, you have to prove that the Caroline I remember isn't gone. Now put the ring on the bed.
 He's still dead. Now, do you want me to cast the spell or not?
 All done.
 It worked.
 She's all yours.
 I'm here.
 Just making sure.
 Could you make it a little less obvious you're on her side?
 Come on! Since Caroline became a vampire, we barely see each other. Losing Caroline was bad enough; I didn't think I'd lose you too.
 Where?
 I can't believe this.
 It's not that you and Stefan are pretending to fight. It's that I didn't even know you guys were fighting at all.
 So that makes me the odd man out.
 I know where I stand, Elena. And I know where you stand. But where do we stand?
 Not yet, I just...she's a vampire, I can't. I think we should get back.
 When I touched him, I saw something.
 I saw Elena.
 He was kissing her.
 Okay. This is as far as I go.
 What do you want?
 Like that's gonna happen.
 I'm listening.
 My visions don't work like that. I don't get to ask questions.
 That's me giving you an aneurysm. Your blood vessels go pop, but you heal quickly; so, I do it over and over again.
 It'd work on anyone with a supernatural healing ability.
 Damon, I'm not gonna help you hurt him.
 All the guys bailed. Something about draft picks. I don't know, I don't speak that language.
 I'm sorry.
 Here's his bag. As requested.
 Why are we doing this?
 I knew you were gonna say something like that.
 He's not gonna be out much longer.
 You're looking for a moonstone. I'm trying to help you find it.
 Somewhere small. dark. There's water.
 No. Like a well? That can't be right. Yeah. It's a well.
 I told you, I only get what I get.
 That's it. That's all I got.
 Hi. How's your mom? Elena filled me in on everything.
 Caroline...Uh...Never mind, I've got to go.
 Not yet. Hey, do you remember that old well where we used to play when we were kids?
 It's in the woods. Do you remember where?
 I think that's where Mason is keeping the moonstone. I got to go.
 No, it's okay.
 Sure.
 What's going on? You just took off in a blur.
 I got Stefan's message.
 What's going on?
 Please.
 I know you love Elena and you want to be with her but it's risky. Too many people could get hurt.
 I don't know, Stefan.
 I could do a spell to trap her, like the tomb spell.
 Okay.
 But no one gets hurt.
 It's perfect.
 it's my ancestor, Emily's. The spell I'm doing here is similar to the one that sealed the vampires into the tomb.
 I mean it takes practice. I've worked on some small spells. Spells that only do good. I don't want to know too much. I don't particularly enjoy any of this, in case you haven't noticed.
 It's anything but cool. Did your family journals tell you what happened to Emily? Or what about my Grams? It never ends well for people like me.
 Because I don't want anyone else getting hurt and I don't know how to stay out of it.
 We need to let Stefan and Damon know the room's ready.
 Do you feel that?
 No.
 Excuse me, do I know you?
 I just got a weird vibe. Let's find Damon.
 I don't know that spell.
 No! I mean no thank you.
 We know what we're doing, Elena.
 Jeremy, it's Katherine. She's linked to Katherine, get them to stop! Now!
 I can't break the spell, Elena. I'm sorry but I can try to take some of the pain away. Okay? Okay?
 Ascinda, mulaf, hinto, ascinda...
 The girl I saw, the one inside! Stay with her, keep pressure on her shoulder!
 There's another witch here, I'm gonna find her!
 Who are you?
 What are you doing here?
 How do you know me?
 Then stop the spell you put on my friend.
 Why are you helping Katherine? Don't you know what she is?
 You're not leaving this room until you stop the spell!
 I don't want to hurt you.
 Please, wait.
 How do I know you? When I gave you the stone, how did I know I could trust you?
 Being around family. My grams.
 Grams? We are related?
 Please, don't leave! I have so many questions. I don't want to be in the middle either. I hate it. How do I stay out of it?
 When did you get your driver's license?
 I'd love a ride home.
 I can't undo the tomb spell, Stefan. Even if I wanted to. It took both me and my Grams to undo it the first time.
 Yeah but Damon's right. She's not gonna tell you anything, not without something in return.
 What if there was another way to find her?
 I‘ll use your blood to draw energy for the tracking spell. You're blood related; it'll make the connection stronger.
 Are you ready?
 There. She's there.
 That's as close as I can get.
 Alaric just left with Jenna.
 Did you send it to Stefan?
 Hey, she's gonna be fine.
 No I don't.
 There's something else I want to try.
 I need a candle. Grab Elena's hairbrush.
 I know it's crazy but I might be able to get her a message.
 Thanks.
 It's nothing.
 I've been doing a lot of magic lately. It wears me down.
 Witchcraft has its limits. If I push too hard, it pushes back.
 It's all in here; it's like a reminder that I'm not invincible. Please...don't...don't tell anyone.
 Because it's a weakness and I don't want certain people to know that.
 I mean anyone that can hurt me.
 It's hard, you know? My grams is gone and my dad, he doesn't want to know about what I am. He hasn't since my mom left. I'm all alone in this.
 I have no idea.
 Thanks. Where's Elena?
 Uh, why?
 Well, you never asked me to play a game of pool before so why now?
 No, hey, okay. Sure. It's just...
 It's just you're Elena's brother and...sure. It's just, I'm really bad at pool.
 Hey, Luka. How was your first day?
 Hi, I'm Bonnie Bennett.
 Oh, I'm meeting a friend but he's not here yet so...sure.
 So, where did you move from?
 That's a big change.
 It's not so bad here.
 Actually I do.
 Oh, there's my friend. It was nice to meet you, Doctor Martin.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I told you.
 Come on, hit the ball.
 So where's your dad?
 I felt something too.
 You're a witch?
 Well, she brought it up before but I just thought she was drunk. 
 New-ish. I still have some growing pains.
 Physically, it's become a lot harder. I have a bad reaction to it sometimes.
 Yeah. And I pass out sometimes.
 From what?
 What is that?
 I don't get it.
 What are we doing?
 What is that?
 Bye, Luka.
 No, he's not.
 It's Damon.
 I might be able to lower the tomb spell long enough for you to get in there and grab the moonstone from Katherine.
 I'm well aware of what happened. I've learned a few new things.
 How will you get it?
 You wouldn't be underestimating her, would you?
 Maybe I can help better the plan. Do you have anything that belongs to Katherine?
 I can turn the metal into ash. Blow the ashes on her, and it'll incapacitate her for a minute or two. Long enough for you to get the stone and get out.
 Go ahead. I'm almost done.
 Shh!
 I'll be fine.
 And Elena could die. I'll be fine. Promise. I promise.
 Sorry I'm late. I had to grab the grimoire from home.
 He said he'd be here.
 Is that the moonstone?
 We can't wait, we have to get him out of there.
 We still have what's left of the ash. 
 It's gonna take me some time.
 I don't know, a while.
 It didn't work.
 I'm not strong enough. Even with help, I can't do it.
 Oh, I don't know. Between here and upstairs there's still time for you to do something stupid.
 Stefan is stuck in there, and I don't know how to get him out. What should I be doing?
 I didn't have a choice, Jeremy!
 Wha-Why did you have to get involved?
 Look, Jeremy....you can't feel that way about me.
 What?
 And you almost did.
 I can't. I - I can't.
 I'm sorry.
 Right now, it's what is binding the Sun and the Moon Curse. If I can figure out a way to remove the spell from the stone, the stone becomes useless.
 Maybe. If he finds out.
 Stefan wants me to focus on this.
 I'm taking Stefan's side with this one. We're not gonna let you get used in some creepy sacrifice ritual.
 We're not arguing about anything.
 I need a coffee.
 Where are you going?
 You're lying.
 Really? Tell your face.
 We tested you, and you failed.
 It's for the best, Elena.
 Hi.
 Luka, I'm so sorry. I wouldn't have done what I did unless it was really important. It's just that there are things that I...
 Wow. So much stuff. What is that? Is this a grimoire?
 How did you get all these?
 This can't all be your family's.
 So that's why you've been so nice to me.
 Listen...do you know how to break the bind between a talisman and a spell?
 If anyone looks out, they're gonna think we're insane.
 Hey! I know it doesn't look like much...
 Sorry...
 I don't have anything to say to you, Dr. Martin, or your son.
 There's nothing confusing about it. I trusted Luka, and he betrayed me. Elena told me you were both working for Elijah, so don't lie about it.
 Spare me the witch loyalty crap.
 You're right, I don't believe it.
 Not at all.
 More lies.
 We haven't done it in ages.
 Shhh.
 We still don't know the extent of what Elijah's up to.
 So, I'm gonna ask Luka to tell me what he knows.
 I didn't say he was gonna have a choice.
 What?
 What was that about?
 I come bearing coffee gifts.
 I found out what your dad did, saving my friends from the wolf pack.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You'll be okay.
 Why don't we go over here?
 Strong one.
 Place these evenly around the room.
 Um, I'll put him in a trance and ask him questions. It's like hypnosis.
 That's what the candles are for. I'll draw power from the flames.
 I got it.
 I need a bowl of water.
 Okay. What was that? "It's hot"?
 So?
 I'm not into Luka. It's just, you know, he understood me, and he was new and different.
 To be picky.
 I don't know. He's fighting me.
 There. All right. Why are you working with Elijah?
 You want to kill Klaus, too. Why?
 Who...who are you talking about?
 Why does he have her?
 What has Elijah promised you?
 And how do you kill Klaus? How do you kill an Original vampire?
 No. 
 What do you mean, after?
 But Elena will be dead.
 Yeah. The sacrifice is part of Elijah's plan.
 No. He'll know he lost consciousness, that's all.
 She was just gonna drop Luka back at the Grill. Said to lock the door on our way out.
 Wait. 
 With everything that's going on, you know, curses and sacrifice...
 Wow.
 Thinking about last night.
 It was a tough spell. I could feel it draining me. I need practice.
 Yeah, sure. Thanks.
 Sorry?
 Sorry, Luka, but everything seemed normal yesterday. I mean, I brought you a coffee and we played pool.
 Hey.
 Thanks. That thing weighs a ton. I'm starving. You guys have any...food?
 Oh, God. Heh! This is a date.
 Jeremy, I need to make sure Elena is cool with us before anything else happens.
 She's my best friend. I tell her everything and this whole hang thing might freak her out.
 Yeah. I liked it.
 It's called channeling. Siphoning power from something...another witch...the Moon, an element.
 What?
 You're right. Let's...see what happens.
 Jeremy!
 He told me about your daughter. I know Klaus has her and I want to help you get her back. But I want us to work together. Please.
 No! No. No!
 He took my powers.
 She's out of the tomb?
 It's impossible. They hate us.
 I'll try.
 Okay. I gotta get to class.
 I'll tell her soon. I promise.
 We know that Klaus has your daughter. I'm sorry about the way I had to get that information, but it's good that we know. We can all work together to get her back.
 I'll do it.
 I don't know what to believe. I think he's at a loss. He's not sure who to trust.
 I'm in.
 Things just got real awkward.
 He said the ball's in your court.
 Why not? All you do is talk about how much you care about him.
 In the bathroom?!
 Um, hey, speaking of happy, would it freak you out if I started dating your brother?
 I know it's weird, but he's been so good and strong. He makes me happy and I really can't tell what you're thinking...Right now.
 Really?
 Dr. Martin. You okay?
 I don't understand.
 Whatever it is you think you need to do, there's a better way.
 No. No, Dr. Martin.
 I don't know. I haven't seen her.
 Don't do this. Please don't do this.
 Luka...I can't believe he's dead. After what we did to him.
 I couldn't do anything to help. I was useless. I hated it.
 Thank God.
 A few minutes ago.
 You didn't have to kill him!
 Don't be.
 When he grabbed me...he gave me my powers back and something else. Jonas wants me to kill Klaus.
 Yes. He did.
 We should pack up the grimoires. They spent years collecting them. I wanna make sure they're safe.
 Don't be disrespectful. Not to him.
 According to Luka's dad, one of these contains a spell that'll let me harness the energy that's left behind when a witch dies violently.
 We weren't but when he gave me my powers back, he gave me a message. If I can find the spot in town, where the old Salem witches were burned, I can harness their energy to use when I need it.
 You know where the witches were burned?
 Not exactly.
 It's this one.
 How do you know where the witches were burned?
 I'm not doing anything.
 I don't think the witches like you being here.
 Can you hand me the grimoire?
 Are you worried about me?
 I'm sure.
 The spirits of the witches who died here. I can feel them.
 I can't tell.
 Here. This is it. Help me set the candles.
 Nothing.
 They're ready.
 I did it.
 It was just a warning.
 It's not important.
 It's a lot of power to have access to. They're just telling me to be careful with it.
 The answer to your question is  a lot.
 I told you to not worry about that.
 All of it.
 Jeremy, do you think I was born with these powers so I could float feathers and blow out candles? There's a reason I was called to do this.
 That's why you're not gonna tell her.
 It's not just for Elena, Jeremy. It's for you. It's for everyone. If I am the only one who can put an end to this, then it'll be my decision, no one else's. Mine.
 So this place is all yours? They just gave it to you?
 Your own personal safe house.
 Wouldn't want to clean it.
 Don't worry, I'm ready. If he shows his face, I can take him. Know how.
 No, and you're not, either.
 You don't know I can't. Have a little faith in me.
 Shh! We don't know that for certain. You promised to keep my secret, I'm trusting you. I'm going through with this, and if you tell anyone, I swear...
 I told him he had to dress up tonight and he got all uptight.
 Tell him she has a boyfriend.
 Where is he? Is he here?
 She's been compelled.
 Me. I'm the plan. He has no idea how much power I can channel. If you can find him, I can kill him.
 It doesn't matter if he's an Original. I can take down anyone who comes at me. I can kill him, Elena. I know I can.
 If you're asking me to go steady, I think that was the fifties.
 The ring won't work on me, Jeremy.
 To protect from the supernatural, not for someone who is.
 Just because a bunch of dead witches gave me a warning doesn't mean I'm going to die.
 Hey. Listen, I...I can't explain it. But I can feel them. I'm empowered, Jeremy, I can do this. I know I can. I'm strong enough.
 Damon.
 You too.
 Good idea.
 Too bad.
 You heard Jeremy and me talking, didn't you?
 Yes.
 He was upset. I didn't want him to worry.
 No matter what.
 You can't tell her.
 Careful, Damon. I might start to think you actually care.
 'Cause I knew how'd you react.
 It's our only option.
 I have the power to save you! If I don't use it and something happens, that would kill me more.
 Just answer one question...if the situation was reversed, would you do it for me?
 So you know why I have to.
 What?!
 Where's Jeremy?
 Go. Run. Run!
 He's possessing it or something.
 He's got some kind of protection spell on him.
 I'm trying! If I kill Alaric, he'll just possess someone else. He knows I have my power, Damon. He's trying to kill me.
 It's what Alaric would want. And he'd want you to suffer first.
 Let's find out.
 Yeah, I'm sure.
 What is that?
 You don't have to stay down here with me.
 I...I need you to talk to Elena for me. Tell her how sorry I am for what Damon and I had to do.
 Elena, Elena, I'm so sorry.
 There wasn't enough time for me to tell you.
 And we'll keep looking. Until the last minute.
 Which one are you reading?
 Yeah, I think she had a thing for him.
 I saw that, too. She just didn't explain what it did, exactly.
 Someone's here.
 Sure, yeah. Of course.
 Why did he take Jenna?
 Then we need to go. Now. Before Jenna's been sacrificed. I can kill Klaus myself.
 Neither is letting Jenna die.
 Where's Damon?
 We found something in the Gilbert journals.
 It's done.
 I'll be back soon.
 And who's going to make sure you're okay?
 I can't put anyone else at risk.
 I'm sorry.
 Phasmatos Infero Eseri Gratas, Disasustos Vom, Mas Pro Je Ta Sue Te. Victamas Veras. Phasmatos Tribum, Niha Sue Exilum, Disasustos Vom, Mas Pro Je Ta Sue Te. Levam, Mina Sue Te, Disasustos Vom, Mas Pro Je Ta Sue Te. Phasmatos Veras. Fes Matos Tribum, Mas Pro Tes Unum. Victas Ex Melam, Phasmatos Vanem. Mas Pro Je Ta Sue Te.
 Do it and I'll take you both out.
 I don't care.
 No.
 I'm not sure this is going to work.
 Let's just hope they want to.
 Emily.
 They don't want us here. They think I'm abusing their power.
 I heard them say a name.
 Klaus.
 If Damon is off the rails, there is nothing you can do to stop him. Let us take care of it.
 Jeremy!
 She's human. The ring won't work on him. Caroline...
 I know what I need to do.
 I need you to grab him. T-take him with us.
 There's a spell for it if they'll give me the power to use it.
 No.
 They're angry at me for coming back here. They don't wanna help.
 They said there'll be consequences.
 Emily. Emily! I know you're there. Please help me. I love him.
 No!
 Oh my god.
 Oh, my God, Jeremy. Oh, my God.
 Doesn't matter. You're okay. You're okay.
 Thank you.
 Hey. What are you doing?
 Yeah, you were dead. It'd be weird if you felt normal.
 You can thank me tomorrow. And the day after that. And the day after that. Good night, Jeremy.
 Huh, you think you're bored. My dad's side of the family is like wet paint that never dries.
 How's the Grill treating you?
 A summer job is good for you. You needed something normal in your life.
 What was that?
 Wait, wait Jeremy. Is everything okay with you?
 Okay.
 I'm back!
 I leave town for the summer and everything goes to hell for the both of you.
 Jeremy.
 The problem with my dad's normal side of the family is normal made for a really boring summer.
 Damon's helping you cook now?
 Caroline...
 Let me see it.
 I have an identification spell that might be able to tell me what magic affected the necklace.
 It's going to take a while, so tell me if anyone's coming, okay?
 Caroline...
 Hey guys.
 I'm not doing anything. It has its own magic.
 Okay, tell me if you see anything in these grimoires that involves precious metals or a symbol that resembles a necklace.
 I don't have access to them anymore. They cut me off.
 Since I brought you back to life. I messed with the balance of nature and there were consequences. Hey. I'm sorry. I know I should have told you. I told Elena when it happened. I just didn't want you to feel weird about it, you know?
 Elena said you've been having kind of a hard time since then.
 Old.
 Jeremy!
 Are you okay?
 I have no idea.
 Hey, Jeremy. There's ashes everywhere.
 No, I got it.
 What's wrong?
 Yeah.
 Hey.
 Yeah, I haven't figured out what's going on with it yet.
 Okay.
 Did Jeremy also tell you that he's been seeing ghosts of his dead girlfriends all summer?
 Vicki and Anna. He's been talking to them.
 I wish. It's because I brought him back to life. The witches said there would be consequences. Guess they were right.
 You know, what am I supposed to...
 Caroline's making us.
 Hey! Where are you going?
 This is fun, right?
 Come on, I am embracing her philosophy. You should be more into this.
 I haven't talked to him all day. We're having, um...He, uh, he told me about seeing Vicki.
 I'm sorry. Is it weird talking about your sister like this?
 Everything was so different then.
 It's crazy, Matt. I...I can't imagine what it must be like for you.
 That's right. If you want to blame someone, blame me.
 I have no idea. The curse he's talking about is a thousand years old. My grimoires don't go back that far.
 I don't have contact with them anymore...They cut me off when I brought Jeremy back to life. That's it! I can't contact the dead. Jeremy can.
 No! I called him like twenty times.
 Okay. I'll meet you by your truck.
 What is taking so long?
 What?
 No, Jeremy can help us save Tyler.
 I don't understand.
 What?! No, Matt, that's crazy!
 No, Matt, I can't do that kind of magic anymore.
 Matt, please! I can't do this. There's nothing else I can do!
 It's okay. You're okay.
 As soon as you're feeling better, I'm going to kill you.
 You did?
 For me?
 Tyler...
 Hey. You ready? I could still use a ride over to Jeremy's.
 Listen to me. I know you want to help, and I know you miss your sister. But what you did was reckless and stupid.
 You don't want to be a part of all this, Matt. You are the only one of us who actually gets to live your life like a normal person, no matter how lost you feel. Don't forget that.
 Anyone else think it should feel slightly more empowering?
 You're right. I mean, why should I let the fact that my boyfriend is seeing the ghost of his dead girlfriends hinder this experience?
 Are you sure you want to be here?
 Hey. Happy first day.
 I'm not mad. I'm resigned to the fact I'm sharing space in our relationship with Anna and Vicki.
 That's not the point, Jeremy.
 I get it, Jeremy. But put yourself in my shoes. You loved both of them. And you guys didn't break up. They died. And you keep letting them back in.
 I, um...I think you have the power to decide whether or not you see them. Remember that. Okay?
 Did you talk to Anna about this?
 About what? I thought they were all alone over there.
 If there's another witch involved, don't you think you should have come to me before you went to Anna?
 She's here?
 I can't...I can't deal with this right now.
 Matt's trying to resurrect his dead sister. I think I'll go deal with that instead.
 Matt! Matt, slow down. What happened?
 What? How? Where is she?
 You need to tell me exactly what you did to let Vicki out. So I know exactly how to send her back.
 I found a spell that can block whatever magic is helping Vicki.
 Give me your hand.
 The spell is working, Matt. She's still here because of you.
 I wish. All I did was block the magic that was helping Vicki get a physical foothold here. Jeremy's still got a direct line to the other side, and as long as he wants to see Anna and she wants to see him, she's still here.
 There. You commented.
 What do you want me to say, Caroline? I went against the balance of nature when I brought Jeremy back to life, and now I'm paying the consequences.
 I'm a thousand times not okay with it. I just don't know what to do about it.
 What do you mean, why?
 What?
 They can't.
 Are you sure? Because she has just as much reason to haunt Damon as Mason Lockwood does.
 Because if any ghost other than Vicki Donovan has a physical foothold on our side, then that means Damon's right and something has gone really, really wrong.
 Yeah.
 I've got a ghost problem to deal with, Caroline. Save the Jeremy lecture for later.
 I think so.
 It's a manifestation spell. It's used to reveal veiled matter.
 Ghosts.
 Yeah. Sorry, I know it's creepy, but we needed a private place around here to do the spell.
 They're not here anymore. And they made it clear they were never coming back.
 Grams.
 I can't believe you're here!
 I didn't have a choice. I love him and I...I couldn't just let him go.
 How do you know this?
 What does the witch want?
 What are you talking about?
 You said boyfriend dramas. Plural. What is it, Caroline?
 What?
 He kissed her?
 Okay. What's going on up there?
 What?!
 No way! I am not leaving you!
 Just go away, Jeremy.
 Matt let go of his sister before you let go of Anna. His sister, Jeremy. You know what you owe me? The respect of not making me listen to you explain yourself.
 You need to go.
 Just go, Jeremy.
 Hey there!
 Got your message.
 I brought you the necklace that wouldn't die.
 Been better...
 It's the same design.
 We don't know. We haven't gotten that far.
 So, don't go. Let's stay home order takeout and over analyze ancient hieroglyphic thingies with Alaric.
 Ha- Caroline actually has a date...
 I don't need to talk about it. He fell in love with his ghost girlfriend and lied about it. What's done is done.
 You are mad at your little brother. You'll yell at him a little, teach him a life lesson. You can't really be mad like I am mad.
 And you shouldn't have to be. He's your brother. So no I can't really talk to you about it.
 Who are all these people?
 You weren't supposed to kill Tyler!
 What is that?
 Oh my god is that the...?
 Why do you have it?
 You have a right to be. Klaus is still out there and he knows you tried to kill him.
 Join the club. Every time I close my eyes, I have that nightmare. On repeat.
 Yeah! Four coffins, Klaus is in one of them. It's weird.
 It's just stress. I'll figure it out. And what about Stefan? Has there been any sign of him?
 How is Damon handling it?
 Stefan. You followed me here?
 What do you want with me?
 Why would I help you? Elena said you saved Klaus's life.
 Are you out of your mind? You're just gonna make him angrier.
 I don't have enough power to hide four Originals!
 Elena, hey!
 Elena, don't get involved. Whatever Klaus wants, stay as far away from it as you can!
 What do you want me to do?
 You don't need a locator spell...
 This is the one I dreamed about.
 What do you mean? Is it locked?
 I think it's closed with a spell.
 You said you wanted to make him suffer. The witches led me here for a reason. I think whatever is inside this coffin is our answer.
 
 Hello? Someone there?
 Hey, sorry I'm late, I...I got held up.
 I was...working on some new spells. You?
 What happened?
 Jeremy wouldn't just leave you to deal with Klaus on your own.
 You what?
 Denver, huh?
 So, were you going to say goodbye?
 Of course I care. I was hurt by what happened between you and Anna, Jeremy. I didn't want you to leave town.
 That's what Elena said. That's exactly what she said.
 Nothing. 
 Change into warmer clothes, we are going to the Falls. S'mores, camp fire..
 I'm sorry, what? You've already claimed your birthday as everyone's favorite day of the year.
 This is creepy, even for us.
 Friend, daughter, overachiever...
 Give her a break! You can't control what everyone does all the time.
 Sorry, I know it's Caroline birthday, funeral or whatever but, I just feel it's really wrong that you compelled Jeremy to leave town.
 He should be able to choose how he wants to live it, you're taking his choices away.
 Why? Are you gonna compel me not to?
 I'm sorry. I'm just gonna go sleep it off or something. Happy birthday.
 Good, you haven't left yet.
 I came to say goodbye.
 Let me out! Please! Oh my god, oh my god! Fes patrus tribum, melan veras, et vasa quisa, exu quisa!
 Hey! I'm in here! I'm in here! I'm in here!
 I've been having these dreams for days now. It's like the witches are trying to send me a message.
 Stefan thought, if you knew where the coffins were, Klaus could threaten people to get the information out of you.
 Yeah. Elijah and two others. This one...is the one we can't open. We don't know who is in it, or whats in it, only that I think my dream's telling me it'll help us kill Klaus.
 I needed her to know about the coffin.
 I think I know, who can open the coffin, Stefan. And I need Elena to help me find her.
 I couldn't place her face at first. Then I realized...
 It's my mom.
 Too old.
 I wish. How many of these are there?
 I know we haven't been able to really...that things had been weird, because of Jeremy, so, thank you for helping me with this. I know you have a lot to deal with.
 It's surreal. Having to track down a woman, who bailed on her own kid.
 The coffin is spell shut. That makes it a witch problem. So it does fall on me. I was bound to see my mother again sooner or later.
 This is her.
 What's going on with you two?
 I just can't believe that I'm actually going to see her. Or meet her. Sort of. Since I don't really remember her.
 What's to say? She left, never wrote, never called. Not even when my Grams died. Could we talk about you and Damon instead?
 I mean...was it good?
 That means it was.
 Oh...It's Stefan. I told him I'd call him as soon as I got the address.
 Yeah, but he's gonna keep at it until I pick up.
 Yeah, in the middle of nowhere.
 It's okay, we can come back.
 Ehm, Abby is my mom.
 Water is fine.
 So, are we...like related?
 She sounds...great.
 That's mine. I'm Bonnie. Your daughter.
 I'll be fine. I'm not here to get my mom back, I'm just here to get her help.
 So, you had a daughter and a best friend and you still left?
 And neither did you.
 It wasn't? You cast a spell, put Mikael down and then...what? You had to teach Jamie how to drive?
 This was a mistake. She has no magic. She can't help us.
 Please, just stop with the muffins and the compliments. I just wanna know the truth...why didn't you come home?
 You don't know?
 We were doing a rough spell, and we both exhausted ourselves. Her more than me.
 Yep.
 It was a dream, actually. I thought, you were supposed to help us. But if you don't have any magic, it's...
 I don't think so.
 What was that?
 What did you do to me?
 Where's Elena?!
 Why?
 I can't. This goes beyond you and me.
 Elena is on her way. Jamie's safe. He's a little bruised, but he's safe.
 You kept your end of the bargain, Klaus usually keeps his. You're willing, to do all this for him...and he's not even your family.
 You can't. You've no magic and I don't trust you.
 I thought you said you didn't want it any more?
 Sorry Stefan, but I didn't have a choice.
 Is this the only grimoire you kept?
 Family history. About a mother, who loved her children so much, she couldn't bear the thought she might lose them. So she turned them into vampires. One of them is Klaus.
 There's nothing in here that's going to help us. I've seen most of these spells. What was this?
 It's a sealing spell. We're trying to open something...Not seal it shut.
 So...unbinding it, would reverse the spell. Unseal it. If we did it together.
 You're not trying! We've been at this for over an hour.
 I had all of those dreams for a reason. The spirits wanted me to find you because your my mom. It's not them, it's you. You won't open yourself up to it. You know Dad never talked about you? And neither did Grams. I had no memories of you. So you know what I use to pretend? That you were dead. It was easier to do that than to wonder why you never came back for me.
 Yes there is. You can help me.
 It almost worked. I have to call Damon, tell him that we're getting closer. I'll be right back.
 I don't know, it's a tricky spell.
 Alright. 
 Speaking of Esther, you should know that she came to see me and Abby this morning.
 I don't want you to worry.
 She wanted to introduce herself. Abby and I helped bring her back. She's channeling our entire ancestral bloodline for power. I think she thought she was being polite.
 Even if there was, why would I want that?
 There's no time to change your mind, Elena. He'll be dead by the end of the night.
 It's a full moon. Esther needs to harness the energy of a celestial event. She asked me and Abby to join her.
 Esther's son, Finn, he's a vampire so...
 She's probably on the other side, screaming about getting involved with vampire business.
 So are you channeling our ancestors?
 The torches?
 What's the spell you're doing?
 The witch spirits will protect us from the Originals, but we should get into the basement.
 Abby!
 Stefan? What's going on?
 Stefan, I- I can't stop her. She's channeling us!
 No...Stefan, no.
 What are you gonna do? Even if you kill us, Esther is channeling every witch in our ancestry, living and dead.
 Hey.
 I made her a daylight ring. She's been standing out there all morning. I don't think she's taking this very well.
 Witches have a connection to the Earth. We can literally feel nature. Life.
 When Abby became a vampire, she lost it. I don't know how to help her.
 Who are you again?
 Right.
 Sounds like code for Caroline lectured you.
 Please. Maybe it'll distract everyone from my crappy cooking.
 Abby!
 You have to drink these, it'll help.
 Caroline said that this kind of thing happens a lot at first when you're still new.
 The only way you're gonna hurt me is if you leave. Don't give up on this. Not again. We can make this work.
 I need a personal effect of Alaric's, something he wore before he started wearing the ring.
 Be ready to do the spell as soon as I get there. We have to work fast. I'll see you soon.
 Hey.
 You okay?
 Abby says that all the dying and coming back to life might have chipped away at Alaric's psyche, making it easier for the darkness to take hold. 
 I'll get you more. Abby and I are gonna work on the garden.
 The transition's been hard, but I think she'll be okay. Eventually. I'm gonna go back and stay with her for a while. It'll give us a chance to work things through.
 I know.
 Of course I do.
 I'm still studying the unlinking spell. It's not that easy, especially under duress.
 This is the spell. I just don't know if I'm strong enough.
 What was that?
 Well, it does bother me. You bother me. Well, you use people to get what you want, it's not right.
 Oh my God.
 Just get me out of here.
 Klaus has Damon.
 No, Elena, he forced me to do a spell that unlinked all the siblings. He's still alive.
 At Klaus' mansion. It's bad, Elena, he threatened Jeremy. And my mom.
 I don't know. I'm sorry, I have to go. I just – I have to – I have to go.
 Why are you still wearing your ring? Didn't Elena tell you?
 Yep.
 You had all kinds of moves out there.
 Well, consider me impressed.
 Yeah, they're the most important thing in the world to me.
 A normal guy wouldn't have said yes to a date with me.
 Let him go!
 I have to do this with you two lurking over me?
 There's always a choice. Whenever you make one someone else suffers.
 Phasmatos Tribum Nas Ex Veras, Sequita Saguines, Ementas Asten Mihan Ega Petous.
 Esther is fighting me.
 A hotspot?
 It's done. Esther's not fighting me any more. The boundary spell is broken.
 I didn't do it for you.
 Thanks for the ride home.
 I know. But it doesn't make it any easier.
 Apparently, it's what I do.
 Sometimes I think I'd settle for just ordinary.
 No. I don't think I am.
 I had no idea what was happening. Okay, the witches led me there. They wanted him to feed so he turned.
 If you are so upset with me, why did you feed me your blood to save my life?
 I've been trying to figure that out. A witch can't truly make an immortal creature, there is always a way to undo a spell.
 That's the problem. I don't know.
 What's going on?
 Why wouldn't she tell anyone where she was going?
 I might have an idea. My mom used a desiccation spell on Mikael that immobilized him for over 15 years. If I can get it, I might be able to use it on Alaric.
 I'll get it. But even with the spell, we'll need a lot of vampire muscle to take him down. Including yours.
 Relax, Abby will be here.
 Jamie said she was coming, okay. Just give her time.
 Thanks for coming.
 Like Jamie said, it's urgent.
 Only vampires live here.
 We called you here because I need help with a spell. 
 You turned your back on me for sixteen years, you have no idea what I can handle.
 That's exactly what we want to do.
 I have to stop a human heart.
 I just got this. It connects me to Caroline and Elena through our phones. 
 Drink this. It's my blood. It bridges us all together so that when I stop Jeremy's heart, you'll have the power to stop Alaric's. You need to make a physical connection to his bloodstream; a vein, artery, something connected to his heart.
 They made contact. It's happening.
 Something happened. The connection broke.
 Oh my God! Jeremy!
 Jeremy! Jeremy!
 We know, but we've been trying to get rid of Klaus forever and Caroline convinced us to enjoy it for a night.
 It means Caroline is driving Elena crazy, as usual. So, as I psychically predicted, flare jeans are making a comeback.
 Say what you want, but I've got a bad feeling about the bonfire tonight.
 You didn't say it back.
 You know what. You can't string him along, Elena. If you're not into it anymore, just tell him.
 It was her call.
 Where's the body? As long as it's unspelled, Alaric is one witch away from finding it.
 I need a minute.
 Elena and Jeremy lost Jenna and Alaric because of him. Tyler's a hybrid, my mother's a vampire. Could you give me a minute to just appreciate the sight of him like this?
 You should burn in hell. But if you die, so do my friends. So does my mother. What am I supposed to do about that?
 I know you're here.
 I did it to save my friends and my mother, Klaus. Not you.
 The spirits don't get to tell me what to do anymore. I'm done getting pushed around by all of you. I did it because I wanted to.
 What is that doing here, Klaus? The deal we made with Tyler was that you'd leave his body and jump into someone else's the first chance you got.
 I can't right now.
 I have to help Elena before she has to feed.
 You're forgetting who just saved your life.
 If I can keep Elena human, you'll still have an endless blood supply to make your hybrids. Isn't that what you really want?
 The spirits aren't listening.
 There's something else I could try.
 If the witches won't help me save Elena, then maybe I can go to the Other Side and bring her back myself.
 She's still in transition. Not fully dead, not fully alive. What if her spirit still exists on both sides?
 I was able to stop your heart to stop Klaus'; I'll do the same thing to myself. Witches have free reign on the Other Side. I will find Elena and I will bring her back with me.
 I'm stronger now. I found a new source of power.
 Do you want Elena back or not?
 Elena.
 Come back. Come back.
 We're going home.
 Grams? What are you doing?
 Elena needs me.
 Grams, please.
 I couldn't do it. It didn't work.
 I upset the spirits trying to save Elena. I can't use that kind of magic again. It's too dangerous.
 Oh my God!
 Fine, I'll do it! Just stop.
Phasmatos Tribum, Nas Ex Veras, Raverus En Phasmatos Ex Sonos. Resistamus Et Veram Vatus. Raverus Phasmatos Ex Sonos.
 What's happening? Let me go!
 Let me go!
 Okay, let her go!
 I'm sorry, Grams! They can't do this to you! Please, don't do this to her!
 No! No! Oh my God!
 What have I done?! What did I do?! What did I do? What did I do?
 My Grams, it was like she was dying all over again. Just because I didn't listen to her about not doing black magic.
 Well, it worked. I tried to do a basic nature spell this morning just to clear my head and it just brought it all back. Like it was happening all over again. Sorry, I'm a mess, I've been holed up in here avoiding everyone. I've completely blown off Jamie. 
 No, come on. Stefan, I'm okay. You're not exactly a drop by kind of guy, just...if something's wrong, tell me.
 No. It's not magical writing, if that's what you're thinking.
 Where'd you get these?
 That's bad timing.
 I don't know. Ask Stefan.
 This is for my Grams.
 If I could spell you out of wanting blood, I would, but I can't, so better you learn this now than at freshmen orientation.
 You went to college?
 You're disgusting.
 Yeah.
 Hot.
 Shhh, shut up.
 What's going on?
 For a second. He found some stuff of my Grams' in his office and he's gonna dig it up for me. Oh, uh, this.
 His name is Professor Shane. And he's not creepy. 
 This is amazing. It's all stuff you picked up on your travels?
 No, I – I don't practice. Not anymore. I lost control of myself and there were consequences.
 Are you...?
 Because you listened to Damon and Damon makes everything he wants sound like a good idea.
 You were supposed to help her and you let her get completely out of control.
 This isn't fun. She's acting like a different person.
 Is that what you want? Her to be like you?
 I can't believe you wrote a book.
 Oh, I'm finding them online.
 You really think you can help me start practicing magic again?
 Now I'm officially curious.
 You really think that would work?
 Maybe. I don't think hypnosis would work. Witches are naturally immune to any sort of manipulation.
 This isn't working. 
 Wow, that's crazy.
 I'm sorry, I just can't.
 I don't have to be afraid.
 I don't have to be afraid.
 Guess it wasn't good enough.
 You lost her?
 How does Klaus even know about this?
 You know if I could do anything to help, I would. But I..
 The spirits won't let me do the magic I'd need to break the curse. But I can ask Shane for help, he knows everything about everything.
 Yeah, I'll bring him to you.
 Nice cautionary tale. Qetsiyah sounds like a badass.
 Shane, this is my friend, Damon. He's kind of an expert on this stuff too.
 Until?
 How are we supposed to find a potential hunter?
 How did I not know any of this stuff about Jeremy?
 We figured out how to help her. You need to kill a vampire.
 Before you do this, you need to know what you're getting yourself into.
 Yeah. Thanks. I – um - I have to ask, how do you know all this stuff?
 Elena, hey. Is everything okay?
 Well, Caroline told me you had to move out to stay away from Jeremy.
 I'm in. Shane taught me some small spells I've been wanting to try.
 He's not creepy.
 I'm assuming this is for Caroline.
 Oh. Are you saying that  
 That's amazing.
 OK, new girls' night rule   no boy talk, yeah? Plus, why talk when we have this?
 It's spirit tea. It opens up your chi, or whatever. 
 Don't judge.
 Check this out  Vamp-speed video.
 Come on.
 You didn't.
 Elena, come on.
 What?
 
 Elena!
 You guys friends again? Thank God.
 It's been baby steps but he's helping with a whole new kind of magic. He calls it expression.
 Jeremy.
 They're here to help you.
 Do you trust me?
 Let's go inside.
 Jeremy!
 Persuasion helps reverse your subconscious thoughts.
 You okay? Shane wants to try again.
 I think we're making progress.
 Caroline, hey.
 Slow down, slow down, what – what's happening?
 Yeah, I don't see why not.
 Do you need my help? I can leave Elena here with Jeremy.
 Yeah, she came with Damon. Who's being slightly less horrible than usual.
 Elena, don't move, okay? No matter what.
 Are you okay?
 Hey, Sheriff.
 Hey, dad.
 So...Far cry from being a traveling pharmaceutical rep.
 Dad, stop. You can't come in here and start making rules.
 You're forgetting I can help protect the town.
 Okay, so now I'm "gifted"? He hates my witch heritage. That's why he travels all the time; he can't handle it. And then, suddenly, he wants to be a protective father? No, not like this. Come on, distract me. Isn't there some magic therapy-thing you haven't shown me yet?
 It's beautiful.
 Oh.
 Does this mean that I have to go home now?
 I can take a hint.
 Thanks, Shane.
 Oh, my god-Kol!
 Shane!
 Who's everyone? I came to find Shane.
 Rebekah? What the hell is going on?
 Shane can't be compelled. Okay? She'll happily torture him to find out what he knows.
 I need salt.
 If this pendant will connect me to Shane, then I can do a protection spell.
 April?
 What's happening?
 Oh, my god.
 Help! Someone help!
 She needs help.
 I did a protection spell, but it accidentally linked Shane to April.
 I didn't know I was doing it! Usually I feel pain or I bleed, but this time I just felt more power.
 What about you?
 I almost killed someone, and that's what you miscalculated? April could have died today!
 My father just became mayor. I can't be out doing black magic.
 Then what is it?
 Great. So now, I can't even meditate right? What else can I fail?
 I did an expression spell that almost killed April.
 It's not funny. 
 You're here with me. I'm in complete control.
 Sheriff?
 Wait! Why are you doing this?
 He already explained this Dad. Pastor Young came to him for help. He was crazy.
 And somehow talked him into killing a house full of people? It doesn't make any sense.
 Mmm. And you're worried that's what he's doing to me. That's why you brought him in, isn't it?
 
 If he's gonna tell anyone what he did, it's me. Unless of course you think I'm too weak-minded.
 I'm so sorry. Rebekah told them you confessed. I know she's lying.
 Told my dad to give us a minute. 
 Yeah. I don't lie. I'm not you.
 
 I've heard this. Skip to the part where you convince him to massacre 11 people.
 If they knew people had to die-
 You're crazy.
 
 You're saying if I help you raise Silas you can bring my grams back? Don't play on my guilt, Shane.
 Don't.
 
 
 Get  
 I owe you an apology.
 Help? Dad, I'm okay.
 I got angry, I admit, but I knew what I was doing.
 Didn't we just establish that we couldn't trust him? He trying to get under your skin.
 I told Caroline that I'd take her place at decade dance prep, but none of the rest of you showed.
 Why does it sound like you're under fire?
 Well, it's hard for me to look forward to this dance while you're trapped in your house.
 You want Jeremy to kill an original?
 I'm on my way, we'll figure it out. Do you think Caroline will notice if there's only 89 red balloons?
 Elena!
 What happened?
 Are you serious? You dumped vervain into the water supply? Where did you even get it?
 Dad, there's a dance tonight.
 Are you serious?
 No! Dad, it's mine and I've been doing fine without you getting involved!
 I have to get to Elena's – have you seen my phone?
 Is that something you read in a book? Because we have never had a family meeting.
 And I told you he's crazy.
 It's not your life, it's mine.
 What's going on?
 I have to go.
 Stop telling me what to do.
 Mom?
 What are you doing here?
 Mom!
 Don't! Jeremy! Hey, stop! Stop.
 Don't hurt her. She's my mom.
 All right? Look at me.
 Just go, okay? I'm right behind you.
 You wanna talk? Let's talk.
 Dad needs to mind his own business. He had no right to call you here.
 I found a new way to practice. It's unconventional, but I can handle myself, I promise.
 Shane is sitting in a jail cell right now. You're going to take his word over mine?
 It's not dark magic, it's Expression and I need it! We found a cure, Mom. There's a cure for vampirism. And I can do the spell to access it. I can save you, but I have to go – now.
 That's not happening.
 I don't belong to the spirits anymore. I belong to myself. Sorry.
 Invite him in.
 Do it!
 Living room. Go!
 You have no idea what I can do now.
 It took time for Finn's line to die off, remember? It'll work.
 Temporarily. I drew on the new moon to bind the spell. We've got three days to find that cure – four, max.
 Sorry, if there was a less awkward way to do this, I would.
 These symbols must have been left for the hunters, so they can find the cure. And this must be the story of Qetsiyah and Silas. According to Shane, Silas asked Qetsiyah for help making a spell for immortality. She helped make him immortal, only to learn that he planned to use the same spell on another women, not her. When she found out, she freaked.
 Yeah. Silas was immortal. She couldn't kill him. So she trapped him in a cave, and buried him alive instead.
 So, the well was magic?
 I've been staring at pictures of Jeremy's tattoo and there's no spell.
 And I'm just supposed to trust you?
 Your wife was a witch?
 And you never thought to tell me?
 
 He's not on the trail.
 I'm gonna stay and try a locator spell.
 How did I get here? What the hell's going on?
 The path behind me 
 
 Yeah, I just slipped. 
 Thanks. 
 Do you trust me?
 Then trust me when I promise I won't let Shane raise Silas.
 Don't worry about me. I'm fine. But if Shane tries to lift a finger on his hand to hurt either one of us...I'll kill him myself.
 Or he'll kill us all.
 
 We did it.
 Best to stay off it, then.
 Look at us. 
 Me, too.
 This way.
 I just know.
 
 What are you doing here, Grams?
 
 How?
 What happened?
 And Shane. Illusions of his wife. That's how Silas controls him.
 I don't think it is, Jer.
 It's, like, fossilized in place. It's like trying to bend stone. 
 He's been frozen like a vampire statue for 2000 years. There's only one way we're gonna get the statue to unfreeze.
 We have to feed him our blood. 
 There's got to be a way to do this without raising him. 
 
 How are you healed?
 Get away from me.
 What you want to do isn't natural, Shane. You can't bring back the dead.
 What do you mean, "now"?
 What are you saying?
 
 
 
 I don't understand what I can do.
 What? How?
 Three? 
 We're what?
 
 
 Jeremy?
 Jeremy.
 I can help you. I'll help you. I can help you. 
 No. 
 
 
 I'm okay.
 
 It's called an Expression triangle. I need to complete it for Silas.
 I know it sounds crazy, but it's the only way to get enough power.
 He's been trapped in there for 2000 years. At some point wouldn't death by old age have been...better?
 Why me?
 How?
 Once the veil is dropped, the Other Side doesn't exist anymore. There's nothing separating us. We're all just one.
 I can't do that.
 I can do it. I have the power. We can bring everyone back  Jeremy, Alaric, Vicki.
 It's gonna be fine...
 It's gonna be okay, Matt, you'll see. I'll bring him back.
 
 You know, I've been thinking. You said if I dropped the veil to the Other Side, that the dead'll return, but that's only for the supernatural. What about the 12 people that died on the Young farm?
 I can't do this.
 How can I trust you if you won't show me your real face? Don't you think it's a little creepy that you're appearing as my dead professor?
 
 
 I need to get rid of the Other Side.
 Completing the triangle means killing 12 people. 
 You want me to kill witches?
 What if I'm not strong enough?
 Dad, it's  it's not his fault.
 Dad!
 Wait!
 
 Is it just you?
 Figured you wouldn't want to draw attention.
 You friends with my mom?
 So she's not coming.
 It's not that. I'm just  I'm strong. You won't be able to do this alone.
 
 Phesmatos tribum  aah! 
 
 I don't wanna do this anymore!
 Let me go!
 
 What are you doing here? 
 What witches?
 How did I get off the island?
 I guess I remember being in that cave, and Jeremy was trying to pry the cure out of Silas' hands. Please tell me he got it. 
 Hey, Jeremy.
 You know, I was  I was thinking about the last thing I said to you. "We did it." Totally lame last thing to say to someone. That wasn't a goodbye, Jeremy. You  you were supposed to come back with us.
 Jeremy?
 How are you here?
 I don't understand.
 Oh, my god.
 Usually I'm at his grave and all of a sudden, he appears to me.
 When I woke up, the couch was on fire.
 I don't know if it's because I was emotional in my dream, or if Shane was right. Without his help, I'll lose control of my magic.
 Um, you look super hot, by the way.
 Oh yeah.
 Matt and I are gonna have the sexiest date there.
 Yep.
 Because I think we are.
 Hey. I know we haven't really talked since...everything. But I just  I wanna say that I miss you.
 Hey. You shut it off because all you could feel were the horrible things happening to you. You still have friends who love you.
 I need some air.
 
 Is this real?
 You and me. My senior prom.
 Of course I do.
 Yes.
 Oh, my god. You're Silas. Get away from me.
 I don't need you. I don't want anything to do with you.
 You're trying to get in my head.
 Leave me alone.
 Did you do that to me?
 You don't care about me. You only care about bringing down the wall to the Other Side, and I won't do it.
 Not like this.
 We have a problem.
 It's like Jeremy was there. I could talk to him, feel him.
 What do you want?
 Something's happening to me.
 No. I gotta get out of here.
 Get away from me, Silas.
 This is what you do. You wait until I lose control and then you want to swoop in and save me.
 Get away from me.
 I will die before I let you control me again.
 
 I know what I'm doing.
 No, I'm not okay. I almost died. The shell of my best friend almost killed me. None of this is okay!
 Silas? I know it's you. My locator spell worked without using any of your possessions.
 You're not Jeremy anymore. Is this the real you? 
 And I want you to.
 Show me your face.
 Studying French. We still have final exams, remember?
 For what, moral support? Or so you can check up on me?
 I'm fine, okay? Silas doesn't control me anymore. And I think I'll pass on the invite. I-Elena tried to kill me. I'm not quite ready to forgive and forget. I'm gonna call you later, okay? I gotta go.
 This has nothing to do with them. This is between you and me.
 I know you took it from the island. You're a scavenger; you'd never leave it behind.
 I didn't switch sides. In two days, there'll be a full moon. Silas wants me to harness its power to drop the veil between our side and the Other Side. He wants to take the cure, and then he wants to die. I said I'd help him and I've been hiding from him ever since, buying time.
 You don't need to worry about it. You just need to bring me the tombstone.
 The less you know, the better. Silas is psychic; he can get into people's heads, read their minds, make them see things that aren't really there. I'm taking a big enough risk just talking to you.
 You don't, but I'm not.
 Because he can't get into my head anymore, because I am the only one who can see his true face.
 Bring me the tombstone, help me stop Silas from unleashing hell on earth. Believe me, I'll make it worth your while.
 Caroline!
 What's going on? 
 I'm sorry. I came as soon as I got the message. 
 Caroline, that is not your mother!
 I'm here now. What did you do to her mother?
 The full moon isn't for two more days. I've been gathering my strength, preparing myself.
 I understand. I will do your spell, I will drop the veil, and I will help you die, I promise. Just don't hurt my friends.
 I won't break it.
 No kidding.
 Qetsiyah.
 I have my reasons.
 You'll get the one thing you want most in this world  freedom. Survival. Never having to run from anyone again. Once I drop the veil, I can speak to Qetsiyah. She created the spell that made Silas truly immortal, invulnerable to any weapon. You'd like that for yourself, wouldn't you? I can give it to you.
 
 A few miles that way, twelve hybrids were killed at the Lockwood Cellar. And a few miles that way  
 It's the Expression triangle. I need to charge all three points and channel the mystical energy from Silas' tombstone. Once that happens, I can drop the veil inside the three points and just long enough to get what I need.
 Silas has done nothing but torment my friends. Now he wants to unleash hell on Earth. He's evil. In two thousand years, only one person has been able to put him down.
 If I can contact her, I can ask her how to do it. Now, hand me the rock.
 I linked us.
 Which means you're stuck with me for the day. Silas can be anyone. If he gets in your head and figures out that I don't need a full moon to do the spell, it's over. 
 You obviously don't know how this works.
 Whatever happens to me, happens to you. Do you really think I want you here?
 Twelve humans burned to death here. They died in vain for Silas.
 
 Okay, this is the center of the triangle. I'm ready. Now, give me the tombstone.
 It's filled with the calcified blood of Qetsiyah, one of the strongest witches in the world. It'll work.
 I'm channeling the Expression triangle.
 It's done. The veil's down.
 Stop talking. I can't reach out to Qetsiyah with you breaking my concentration every 5 seconds.
 Can you be quiet?
 I'm not letting you go.
 Fine. Go. Stop them.
 Katherine. Find Katherine. We're linked.
 Yeah, now that I unlinked her.
 Waiting for Qetsiyah.
 Silas. But - I saw Caroline. How? I thought you couldn't get inside my head.
 Stay away from me.
 But every dead supernatural creature will be roaming the earth.
 I was never gonna drop the veil.
 I won't let you 
 
 I - I was so worried about you.
 I messed up. I'm sorry.
 No, I can't. Qetsiyah was able to immobilize him so he couldn't feed and get into people's heads. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to put him down.
 I may not be able to kill you, but I will stop you.
 I will make the blood clot in your veins. I will make every bone, muscle and joint in your body turn to stone. You won't have power over us anymore.
 He can't hide behind his mind-control anymore. He's becoming his true self.
 I guess we'll never know.
 You need to get rid of Silas' body.
 You don't have to say anything.
 You weren't you. I know what that's like. I wasn't me for a long time. We can talk about that later. 
 I'll give you guys as much time as I can. 
 Not yet.
 I can bring Jeremy back, I can keep him here.
 Elena needs him. This was always the plan. Jeremy wasn't supposed to die.
 I have every magic! I have the spirits!
 Phasmatos revenios un Animum.
 I have Expression!
 I have the darkness.
 Phasmatos revenios un Animum. Phasmatos revenios un Animum. 
 Oh, my god...I'm dead!
 I hit kind of a snag.
 I'm trying to fix it, but I'm running into some trouble. I need to wait until the full moon tonight to have enough power to put the veil back up.
 Maybe we should just cancel.
 Can you not make jokes about hell freezing over? We're not that far off from that already.
 Okay, I promise. I love you.
 I know. Okay? I know I need to tell them, I just can't. They've been through too much already.
 And here I was hoping the ghost of anyone would've killed you already.
 Funny you still think you're going to get it. I told you, Qetsiyah's the only witch who knows the immortality spell. If she was a no-show, you're out of luck.
 Did you just threaten my best friend?
 I could crush your skull without even flinching.
 Where's Elena? We can't do this without her.
 It's our last hurrah before you guys go off to college.
 I'm happy we're all here.
 Thanks, Dad.
 For everything.
 
 The veil goes back up tonight. Don't you have anything better to do than harrass me and my friends?
 The Kol I remember was adamantly against hell on earth.
 It's me. I died last night. I'm a ghost, and I want the same thing you want. I don't want to be on the Other Side with unfinished business. I want my parents to see me off to college, I want to decorate my dorm room with my best friends. I want to stay here, Kol. More than anything.
 This will hold you till dark. Then, when the veil is back up, this town will be rid of you for good.
 It was true. But we don't always get what we want, do we?
 Hey.
 I need to close the veil, Jer. The hybrids, and the hunters–
 Did you and Elena...?
 It's almost closed.
 Then don't say anything.
 Oh, my god.
 It worked, Jer. I did a spell that brought you back. I didn't think it would work, but I – I closed the veil and you're still...here.
 It's okay.
 I have the witches, and my grams...You can see ghosts, we can talk whenever we want.
 Do me this one favor  you tell Elena and Caroline that I'm spending the summer with my mom.
 For the first time in forever, my friends are okay. I don't want to take that from them.
 I'm gonna be okay, I promise.
 Wait, don't start with "dear".
 I'm just saying, people don't say "dear" anymore.
 Thank you.
 
 
 
 We're all here together.
 Tell her I'm...at the Grand Canyon.
 How many postcards have I sent him? How many times has he called? I've done enough, he's clearly not missing me.
 I just saw her at college. She seemed genuinely happy. I am not taking that away from her. We're lucky, Jer. How many people die and still get to talk to their best friends?
 I died. Jeremy, I bound the magic that took down Silas. When I died, the spell must've broken. He's free.
 Jeremy, hold on. Hey, I know you can hear me. Jeremy.
 Oh, my god.
 "We're all here together."
 
 The entire town did exactly what he said. He didn't want any witnesses, so he told them to forget what he did. They watched my dad die...they couldn't do anything, or tell anyone. What are you gonna do? You gonna hug me?
 Well, you can't. You can't touch me, and I can't touch you, because I'm dead. Just like my dad, except he's not supernatural, so I don't get to see him on the other side. He's just dead.
 Silas is using his mind-control to find Katherine. He told everyone in the town square to keep an eye out for anyone that looks like Elena. Whatever he wants with Katherine, we can't let him have it.
 Freaky, isn't it? The feeling...the void...the emptiness.
 The Other Side. The Gilbert ring brought you here when you died. That's how it works — temporarily brings your spirit here. To go back, you have to reconnect to your body.
 That's because each time you die, you wake up farther and farther away from it...and you wander the Other Side until you find it.
 There's something you should know...
 It actually hasn't been so bad. I have Jeremy, and I see Grams sometimes. Last night with my dad was the first really hard time...I'll be okay, I just have to get past these next few days.
 It has to be, because there's nothing I can do about it.
 There it is.
 It's really good to see you, Matt.
 I'm not ready to be dead yet, Jeremy. I'm just not. Maybe I will be one day, but it's not today. And I don't know what to do about my dad, or what to do when the sheriff calls, because she's gonna call me—
 Silas is using his mind control the find Katherine.
 Don't stop on my account.
 It's not like there's Netflix where I am. You working out is my main source of entertainment.
 And every girl on the Other Side thanks you for it.
 There's nothing I can do to get Stefan's memory back, Jeremy.
 What happened to you being there for me in my decisions?
 Please don't do this, Jeremy.
 Please, Jeremy.
 Do not say it, Jeremy.
 It's okay. They need this. I need this.
 Say that I'm not going anywhere, say that even though they couldn't see me I've been there the whole time.
 And I saw you happy, and I know you think now that you can't have a normal life...
 
 I watched you decorate that dorm room like your life depended on it. 
 
 I'm right here, Elena, and I miss you too. 
 Maybe he has a plan B. Maybe he wants to do more than just drop the veil and let all the ghosts out.
 Powerful spells are bound by something even more powerful  the moon, a comet, a doppelgänger. The Other Side was made 2,000 years ago, and it still exists. That means she must have bound it to something that could exist just as long.
 Supernaturally, yeah, it's possible, but this is the same Silas who murdered my father. He's ruthless, and whatever spell he could do, there'll be some consequences. There always is. So no. My answer is, definitely not.
 What?!
 You need to call Damon and tell him you lied.
 Silas is too dangerous!
 I brought you back because Elena needed you.
 What about the consequences? Haven't we learn this by now? When you abuse magic, there's always a price.
 What did that crate do to you?
 I didn't want to miss the excitement. It's not everyday  a girl comes back from the dead.
 I'm not jinxing it. I'm being realistic. It's not a dime store spell, Jer. When I brought you back, it killed me. Remember? What I meant was it's just  It's not something I'm going to count on, okay?
 It'll work.
 Jer, just so we're clear, I would die a hundred times over just to have you standing here alive, in front of me.
 It's okay, Jeremy.
 Jeremy Gilbert, do you not know me at all? Is there a part of you that thinks for one minute that I'd let one of my friends die just so that I could come back to life? I'm dead, Jer, and as much as I want to come back, maybe i'm just supposed to accept that.
 I know we were. Now go help him kill Silas.
 Tell her it's for the best, Jer.
 
 Don't you dare give me a goodbye speech.
 Okay.
 Jer.
 Wait. Don't tell me. If you don't tell me, we'll have to wait until another time, which means there will be another time.
 Just go with it, okay?
 I guess all those years alone sent her over the edge.
 You can see me?
 I can touch her.
 Jer, I think I've got an idea.
 That's not the point.
 I came to say good-bye.
 Amara's dying, Jer.
 Stop. We don't have much time.
 Tell me the third thing.
 Tell me. Please.
 I love you, too.
 I can feel you.
 You guys can see me?
 It worked!
 Thank you.
 I'm here. I'm back.
 I miss this. I miss feeling warm. I never felt warm on the Other Side.
 Tessa. Where did you just come from?
 Hi, Mom. I know we haven't seen each other, or talked in a while...so I wanted to make you a video update. I finally finished my whirlwind summer tour, got a new 'do and, I'm in college at Whitmore, where Grams taught. And this is my dorm! It's huge, right? It even has a fireplace! I mean, what dorm has a fireplace?
 Oh, here they are. Hey, guys! Say hi to my mom! 
 Okay, so I left out a detail...or two. I'll explain when she visits. How big is this party going to be?
 Hmm...Augustine, right? The one who covered up your roommate's death and wants you kicked off from campus.
 What? I've kept up! The Other Side is boring. What else am I supposed to do?
 
 What??
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
 You mean, Damon's house? 
 Yep. Gotta go to class. See you tonight?
 Yeah, yeah. Long story. She's, uh, surviving fine. You'll be great.
 No. I'm sorry. I'm just looking for my  I'm not sure what he is, actually.
 He's my best friend's little brother. He's still in high school and I  I think I'm madly in love with him!
 You doing okay?
 You are. What, um...what got you here?
 
 The Anchor to the Other Side. Every supernatural being that dies passes through me.
 It's better than being dead.  I'm so sorry. That was such a stupid thing to say.
 Yeah. I think I am.
 Where are we going?
 I'll admit it. I miss magic.
 Oh, my God. I think Jesse's dead.
 Ahhh! Ohhhh!
 I'm the anchor to the Other Side, Jer. Every supernatural being that dies has to pass through me.
 I'm back, here, touching you. We knew there would be consequences. Just kiss me.
 Kiss me.
 You and me. This, this is worth it. Any consequence is worth this.
 Which is why we brought breakfast to you.
 So that's it? You're giving up?
 
 My Grams died trying to close a tomb she wasn't in.
 What?!
 This property is massive.
 No offense taken.
 I didn't think I was obligated.
 I think so...I mean, she's human, but she's also a doppelgänger...and a traveler, apparently.
 I see lots of people  my grams, the other witches, Vicki...I just don't talk about it you know...because it's just...
 She's here. She said she loves you.
 Katherine..
 Um, I haven't been moping or dabbling. (They sit.)
 Hey, do you mind if I share?
 Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.
 Yeah. Yeah. Sounds like fun.
 I told you it was weird.
 Caroline would kill me.
 You know what? You're right. I am happy.
 What are you doing here?
 Let go of him.
 Ok. Well, you just said it. I can't do magic anymore, so go away.
 Who the hell are you?
 Stop! Stop! Ok. Fine. I'll help!
 Enzo has Jeremy. If I don't get a witch to find Wes by midnight, he'll kill him.
 Hey.
 Look, under normal circumstances, I'd probably try to warm up to you, be your friend, or something, but I'm kind of under a time crunch, and I need your help.
 We're in sociology together. I'm Bonnie. My grams, Sheila Bennett, use to teach here, occult studies.
 I know you're a witch. I saw you spin that pen this morning.
 You don't have to be scared. I used to be one too.
 I really need your help.
 Concentrate. Forget about the vampires. Focus on tapping into your power, listen to the sound of your heart beating, the sound of your lungs filling with air.
 Repeat after me  Phasmatos Tribum, Nas Ex Veras, Sequitas Sanguinem.
 Just relax.
 Now keep your eyes closed and use the blood to find Wes.
 You don't have to.
 Just concentrate. Try again!
 I've done bad things too. Okay. Okay. I've broken windows; I've set more fires than I can count.
 I'm saying I learned how to control it. I can teach you the same thing.
 Yeah. He is and his life is literally in your hands.
 Okay.
 That's what made her so believable. She played Elena to a tee. If she let you die, her cover was blown.
 A surprise party? Seriously? I wanted a spa day. You try feeling the death of every supernatural creature who passes through you on their way to the Other Side.
 Hey, how's it going?
 Yeah, I had to pull an all-nighter for my sociology exam, and then I woke up to a coven of dead Russian witches passsing through me on the way to the Other Side. 
 Do you want to maybe meet up for coffee or something? It's just one of those days, you know?
 
 Okay. 
 Kind of, yeah. Um, do you remember that locator spell we did the other night?
 Now, we need you to find his sister.
 Liv, will you help us?
 Actually, he's her cousin. 
 That's...That's not how I taught you
  Phasmatos Tribum, Nas Ex Veras, Sequitas Sanguinem.
 
 
 I'll take your hand, and you'll go to the Other Side. Just like that.
 
 
 This is for you, Dad. I want you to know how much I miss you.
 Well, you're here. That means it worked. You're dead.
 Let's get this over with.
 What is that supposed to mean?
 Why are you telling me this?
 Katherine, what did you do?
 I don't know. This has never happened before.
 I don't know. I don't control it.
 It's not up to me.
 I can't help you, Katherine.
 What is she doing?
 If they do, they don't brag about it as loudly.
 Okay, hot shot.
 Set it on fire.
 Simple fire spell..
 That's weird..I guess your resume still needs a little padding?
 Elena. Stop. You're not yourself.
 It's too dangerous to let you out in public when you're sick.
 Elena! Stop. This is the virus.. It's in your head. Katherine wanted to destroy you and it's working! You have to fight it.
 Oh my god. Elena!
 I am so sorry about all of this.. I..
 Look, if you don't want any part of this, I get it. Magic isn't for everyone. I won't be offended.
 Good, I'll see you tomorrow, bright and early for some levitation
 Hey. I got your text. What's the friend emergency?
 Oh my God. When did it happen?
 But you didn't come home last night.
 Oh!
 Ugh.
 Probably.. Does Jeremy know that you and Damon definitely, maybe, broke up?
 Well.. that's weird. He didn't mention anything to me. If he wasn't at home, where was he?
 Uhh. Sorry, Katherine's cute BFF just showed up.
 I have an idea. Since you and Damon are officially over...
 They'd be cute too.
 Hey. Hey, can I help you?
 You just keep looking over there. I thought maybe you wanted to say something.
 Hmm. Science isn't really my thing.
 What are you talking about? Who are you?
 She said she knew you. How did she know you?
 Someone named Hazel. She had a message for you.
 So, you're Liv's twin brother and a witch? Anything else I should know?
 I'm not mad. I'm creeped out. Why have you been watching me all day?
 We're not done.
 No. She's at your school today, remember? What's going on?
 Liv? Since when do you two talk?
 Hey, Jeremy. It's me Bonnie Bennett, your girlfriend, just in case you need reminding, which I'm happy to keep doing until you call me back. So call me.
 Hey, Grams.
 Did you read that in the other side newsletter? Grams, you don't look right.
 As in come back?
 That wasn't creepy. What's going on over here?
 Surprise. Actually not really. I left you a voicemail, and I texted.
 Right. All your stuff. Anyway, I need your help. I think something's going on on the other side.
 My grams says the witches are worried someone got out, and I thought since you could see ghosts 
 Liv's here? Are you kidding me?
 Right. Was that before or after you lied to my face and tried to kill his sister? Tell me what's going on.
 Matt? What are youdoing here?
 What?
 What?
 You're making jokes now.
 Ok. Here's what's not ok. Do what you want to protect me, but don't fall off the face of the earth, especially with someone who was caught lying to me and who tried to kill Elena. Don't put me in a position where I have to question you because I 
 Listen. I was gonna say because I choose to trust you, and I want to be right.
 Matt, are you ok, are you ok?
 You remember? That doesn't happen.
 I don't know.
 Hey. I'm sorry I'm late. What did I miss?
 Considering?
 I'm not in denial. The other side is disintegrating. As the anchor to the other side, I'm only alive as long as there is an other side. I'm perfectly aware of the threat of my impending death. There is nothing I can do about it. It's called acceptance, fifth stage of grief. Look it up, tutor guy.
 Fine. If you guys promise to stop hovering, I'll ask Liv if she has any witchy ideas. Besides, don't we have bigger problems with those Travelers trying to take over Mystic Falls?
 Nothing. Not really nothing. More like a rhetorical question about how to fix an imploding supernatural purgatory.
 You know Enzo?
 Liv, what are you doing? Stop.
 You can cut the scared hostage act.
 Enzo may be using you as his little pocket witch, but if he kills either of them, the Travelers can't do whatever they need to do with the doppelgänger blood, and the witches win.
 This whole time, I thought I was doing you some favor by teaching you magic, and you're more powerful than I ever was.
 Does your coven know the other side is falling apart?
 It is not about me. I have friends there, my grams. I mean, there's got to be something that can be done to save it, a spell, a ritual, something.
 No!
 No. Please, Stefan.
 Come on, Liv. You're ok, you're ok.
 Yeah, go.
 It's already done. He's fine. So you're probably gonna get fired.
 Did you think of something?
 But there's always another spell, a loophole, a sacrifice, something.
 Thanks. Do you mind if I talk to Jeremy for a sec?
 Thanks.
 Do I? In light of the Tyler thing, it's probably nothing, but 
 This whole thing with the other side, I don't know what's going on, but if it does go away... Liv thinks there might be a way to save me, so...
 Whew. Sorry. Hang on. It's Stefan. Hello?
 Jeremy. Why?
 Yep. Understand.
 Nothing. Just someone passing through to the other side, a werewolf or something.
 What?
 We have the dorm to ourselves for an entire weekend, and you want to talk logistics?
 I told you Liv is working on a spell to keep me here.
 Oh. Another secret bro meeting?
 I know I shouldn't lie.
 I know I have to tell him. I just need a few more days with him before I 
 How did you do that? How did you move that? You can't move things from the other side. That doesn't happen.
 When we planned our romantic day together, I wasn't picturing you, me, and two other guys.
 Not to be the only girl here, but I can't watch this. I'm gonna go upstairs.
 Stefan, hey. Remind me why I passed on the cloaking spell party again.
 Why?
 Actually, yeah. My grams knocked a lamp right off my desk today. I doubt it's easy, but if someone were emotional enough...
 Of course the creepy Travelers are hiding their bodies in creepy caves.
 Right.
 Oh, my god. All these Travelers are passengered inside people in Mystic Falls?
 You're sure Julian has an eagle tattoo?
 Or a really cute eagle. Moving on.
 We're together... in a cave of semiconscious Travelers who want to take over our town, but it could be worse, right?
 Jeremy?! Jeremy!
 You/he was right. The Travelers wanted it.
 Oh, my god.
 They started the spell to make Julian permanent.
 He said you promised to bring him back.
 Whatever.
 Please stop talking.
 You need to fix this before I lose my mind.
 I think he wants to be penciled in for today.
 What?
 That's not a great idea.
 You want to kill Tyler?
 We have to be out of here right after finals, which I might skip, due to the potential extinction of magic in the place where I was spending my summer break.
 There is no spell.. I made it up. The other side is collapsing and everyone in it, including me, is going away for good.
 So no. I don't think you should kill Tyler.
 Don't you get it? There is no solution.
 The travelers used doppelgänger blood in that spell to bring Markos back, which means, they basically destroyed the magic that holds the other side together. It's unraveling and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it. It's over, Enzo. You're not coming back. Accept it.
 I know you.. you tried to kill my boyfriend in the caves...
 I'm thinking
 I think I know how to get us all back from the other side. I need to find Enzo.
 What's wrong?
 Stefan....
 This can't be happening.
 I lost it.. I'm sorry.
 Damon, stop.
 I did. I had a traveler who knew the right spell.
 I didn't lose her. She was sucked into oblivion like everyone else on the Other Side.
 It's more than just knowing the spell. Markos was able to come back because dozens of Travelers were willing to sacrifice themselves in order to overwhelm me. I doubt they'll be willing to do that for a bunch of supernatural strangers.
 I know that. Do you think I want to die?
 I know that!
 I know that, Damon.
 Enzo is here.
 Are you serious? You found another Traveler?
 More or less.
 No. One more person we need to bring back.
 Tell me about it, but with Liv doing the spell, not bringing her brother back would be just 
 Cruel. It would be cruel, but none of it matters if your mysterious Traveler doesn't show.
 Tyler, is that you?
 You're dead, and you're you. Caroline was right. Dying eliminated your passenger.
 I did, but we can bring you back.
 I need you to trust me, OK?
 You need to go be a younger, hotter Bruce Willis, and if I take one step into Mystic Falls, good-bye magic, good-bye anchor, good-bye me.
 Being an anchor is like being a gateway. Usually, it's one way, but when the Travelers die, Liv will do the spell, and her magic combined with all those Travelers opening the gate at once will allow the people on the Other Side to push their way through me like Markos did.
 I stop being the anchor.
 Jeremy, I will be fine. Look. I got to go, OK? Be careful. (she hangs up.)
 My plan is my job... just like the spell is yours, which apparently you suck at. Should already be on the road.
 Stefan.
 Oh, my God. Silas. You killed my dad.
 I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous about unleashing a plague onto humanity.
 Just teach me the damn spell.
 Yep. Learning the spell as we speak. I'd introduce you, but, um 
 Moody old lady. Kind of senile.
 Yeah. We're good, but Silas is a crappy mentor, FYI.
 Bygones.
 Come on, Grams. Where are you?
 Thank god! I found us all a way out.
 You need to pass through me when the ritual begins.
 Grams... You can't. This place is imploding and taking everyone with it.
 What does that mean?
 I don't understand...
 I love you.
 Elena! Did it work? Are you???
 Okay. When you guys pass through me, you're going to wake up with your bodies on the other side. I need you to get back here as fast as you can.
 Come on guys, we don't have much time. Grab my hand!
 We'll find him!
 It's okay. I can do this.
 I can hold on. I have to. Just come through. We have to finish this!
 Lexi! Come on! It's you turn!
 Thank god!
 She made it through.
 Come on
 We can't! That was our one shot.
 ELENA...
 It's too late.
 He's here. You can say good-bye.
 If I told you the truth, it would have changed our last days together and I didn't want it to change. We were happy.
 I died Jer, the day before graduation. And the rest of this has been a gift. I choose to be thankful that I didn't waste a second of it. So, take care of Elena.
 It is. I'm sure there are a million people we'd rather be with right now, but...
 Do you think it'll hurt?
 Every day I tell you I hate that.
 What happened? Where are we?
 Look.
 Why don't we see any people? If we're still on the Other Side we should at least be able to see the living.
 I have no idea.
 There's something weird about these cars.
 Rare solar eclipse expected to be seen across 12 states?
 May 10th, 1994. Is that ? Are we ? But that's impossible.
 It feels so weird to be back here, I practically grew up on this porch.
 Before the Other Side collapsed, my Grams said that she made a sacrifice so that I could find peace.
 Well, this clearly isn't peace, otherwise I wouldn't be stuck here with you.
 She must have I don't know, sent me somewhere. And when I held your hand...it took you with me.
 No, but if we got here by magic, magic should be able to get us out.
 Phesmatos incendia
 I didn't know you cooked.
 Oh, Ms. Cuddles, I lost her when I was nine. But I went into my house last night and...here she was. I also found this at my Grams's house. Her old grimoire.
 So we're in this snapshot of another time, or...something.
 Everything that existed in 1994, still exists.
 Listen, there was a time when I couldn't practice magic. This grimoire taught me alot, maybe...I can reteach myself.
 Would a little support kill you?
 Oh, gee, thanks Alright, what's a seven letter word for 
 We're living the same day all over again.
 What's a seven letter word for kill me now?
 And so did this crossword puzzle. Everyday for two months I've done this stupid thing and I still can't figure out 27 across. Old tongue twister, Eddie turned top 40?
 I hate pancakes!
 Well I swear I heard something!
 You know what? You think we're trapped in your hell? I have to spend everyday on repeat with the person I like least on this earth ! Maybe we're trapped in mine.
 I miss them too, you know.
 Eggs, milk and ooh candles. (She picks up one and sets it in the cart, Damon looks at her for a second.)
 You know, when all this started, you sucked at making pancakes but now they're somewhat edible.Milk.
 There's no reason to be Peter Pessimist. We have proof we're not alone.
 I get what you're doing.
 You refuse to have hope that you'll see Elena again so you don't have to be disappointed.
 No, day-mon-a,  There were pork rinds on this shelf, There have been pork rinds here on every shopping trip we've had for the past 4 months.
 You hear that?
 Or someone put a quarter in it and turned it on.
 Well, you say that this is your hell right? If there's someone else here, that means it's not your hell, and if it's not your hell that means Grams put us here, and if Grams put us here there's a way out.
 Thank you. So now that we have properly placed our hope, let's play a game. When we get out, what's the first thing you're gonna tell Elena?
 Damon.
 I don't know, you still think i'm useless? (She points to the parking lot and the screen pans to show Damon's car in the parking lot)
 How much longer are we gonna listen...
 How did it even get here, Damon? Did you leave it here in 1994?
 Ok. So you admit that it's pretty unlikely that you did.
 Which would stand to reason.. that...
 Wait. Did you just see that?
 It was behind the pickup.
 Are you sure?
 But your car.
 And the crossword?
Give me your ring.
 Give me your ring. Hope is the only thing keeping me going, Damon, so if you're really done, if you have none, then be done because this isn't helping. (She leaves from there)
 Stay away from him.
 Run.
 Phesmatos Incendia. ( Fire lights up in front of Kai)
 Giving up so soon? I'm embarrassed for you.
 Really? Do you always try and kill your teammates?
 So you did all that just to make sure I would have my magic?
 I found everything you asked for  can-opener, shower drain, grinding wheel, jam, pocket knife, volume "O" of the encyclopedia, a nail and a black marker.
 Now what?
 Play nice.
 Why don't you just tell him your story?
 Maybe telling him your story will take your mind off of it.
 The side where we get to go home to the people we love?
 Tell me you didn't kill a pregnant woman.
 We?
 Hell. Yeah.
 Phasmatos Tribum, Nas Ex Veras, Sequitas Sanguinem It doesn't feel right. Maybe I need a bigger map?
 Phasmatos Tribum, Nas Ex Veras, Sequitas Sanguinem. Phasmatos Tribum, Nas Ex Veras, Sequitas Sanguinem.
 Mm-mm, the spell's working. It's showing me Mystic Falls. It feels so... close. It's right here.
 That's the Ascendant?
 You know you could have just shown us the Ascendant to begin with.
 There's something not right about him.
 You know, I can't wait to get out of here and talk to somebody else.
 Oregon.
 I read this paper like a thousand times, and there's something in it about Oregon.
 You know, Kai said he had all these brothers and sisters.
 Family massacred in Portland. The only one missing was the oldest boy, a 22-year-old named Malachi.
 All these kids were murdered!
 What?
 You just killed your whole family?
 They created it for you.
 We're not letting Kai out of here, okay? He just said he's a serial killer.
 How can you not care? Maybe because of the horrible things you have done? Maybe 'cause killing a bunch of kids is not a big deal to someone who's murdered a pregnant woman? Am I wrong?
 I'm sorry, Damon.
 No.
 Thinking about that pregnant lady. She had a thing for pancakes.
 You remember it, don't you? You make pancakes every day.
 No. 'Cause you're punishing yourself. You call this place your hell, and it means you feel remorse. That makes you different from Kai. Maybe there is hope for you.
 You're in a good mood for the first time this decade. Stop that.
 Yeah, assuming Kai's telling the truth.
 Yeah. And assuming I can do the spell, which I won't know...until I see it.
 Look, I want to go home more than anything but Kai's a sociopath, who's to say he won't screw us over?
 Why?
 By 'witchy woo', I assume you mean the spell?
 Let me see it.
 Hey.
 You know there's a very probable chance you're digging your own grave, and... not bothered?
 No. We are not going anywhere until you show me the spell.
 Fine, you don't want to show me the spell? Then you can do it yourself.
 You... want my magic. Take it.
 I'm serious Kai! This was your big threat, wasn't it? If I do the spell and let us out of here, you'll just take my magic, leave me for dead, and do the spell yourself. So go ahead. Take all of it.
 It's okay, he won't kill me.
 OW.
 He doesn't know the spell. Which means, we don't need him. Motus.
 Can you...stop. Let me concentrate?
 Damon, I'm working on something-
 Think about it, Damon. What prison gives an inmate a key?
 I think the Gemini coven used a Bennett spell to create this place, what if that's why my Grams sent me here?
 You know the last thing my Grams said to me... was to stay strong. What if that was her way of telling me I have the power to get out? I have the ascendant, a massive celestial event to draw from, plus a burning desire to get away from you.
 
 That's why Kai wouldn't kill me. He needed a Bennett... I was his only way out of here.
 Home. You coming?
 Okay
 It's time, Damon.
 Yep.
 Not exactly.
 Let's go AH!
 DAMON, NO!
 I'm not going to make it.
 But you are.
 Motus.
 It's Bonnie. Leave me a message (Beep)
 Like you shot me with an arrow.
 I don't want to help. You're a psychopath. This place is your prison. I'm not letting you out. Besides, you'll just kill me the minute we get out.
 Antibiotics. Painkillers.
 An hour and 43 minutes. I can do this.
 Where's the last piece? Where is it? This isn't happening.
 Vados!
 Aah! Unh! Get off me!
 Thanks.
 You said you wanted to get out of here... And I quote... "To give the rest of the Gemini coven an excruciating death."
 Let's just go home.
 
 
 Sangina Mearma, un magica
 I don't know.
 I can't.
 I can't. I've lost my magic.
 It's so strange. I wonder if I accidentally put it somewhere. Oh, I remember now. I put it somewhere safe.
 Do you remember saying you wanted to be more like me... Brave, loyal, patient?
 Oh, it's gone. I guess we're stuck here forever. Sorry.
 How did I...
 Where are we?
 You could have brought me anywhere in the world, and you took me to Portland?
 Ow!
 And what day is that?
 Why did you want to come back here?
 Your pager? Why?
 Listen, Kai. My magic's gone, which means we will be stuck here forever. Why don't we just divide the world in half and go our separate ways?
 I will never trust you or like you or enjoy your company for so much as one second, so just quit trying. Just let me leave here unharmed.
 So you agree? One last dinner, and then we peacefully go our separate ways.
 How can I help?
 Really? You've been eating that same piece for 45 minutes.
 I had Thanksgiving dinner with you. Now you keep up your end of the deal and give me your car keys.
 Quit stalling and give me your keys.
 I've read the newspaper. You murdered your siblings, and your coven sent you to live in this prison world.
 So Jo agreed to the merge?
 Still there.
 You have magic again. Good for you.
 Doesn't matter. You need a Bennett witch to do the spell.
 What?
 "I lied"?
 There's no car. The bastard took the car.
 That was so sweet. Why'd you ruin it by calling me annoying?
 Elena? Elena, is that you?
 I can't believe I'm hearing your voice right now. How are you here?
 After cooking me Thanksgiving spaghetti and stealing my blood. It's been a strange few days.
 Don't know. I hotwired a car, and I'm on my way back to Mystic Falls.
 A badass apparently. A badass in Muncie.
 I can make it in time. I'm going home.
 Ok.
 Sorry. Had to.
 Come on. Caroline's over there.
 Come on.
 Heh. Nope. I'm not noticing you. Today's not May 10, 1994. Today's the tree decorating ceremony, and you are not telling me otherwise.
 Doubtful. My dad's conference is two hours away from any beach.
 Are you serious?
 Oh! I love you. Almost as much as I love torturing Jeremy.
 Ok, tree. Let's do this.
 Well, I love my bracelet.
 I miss you guys.
 Happy Birthday,
 Drama queen.
 Cheers to making it this
 It's
 Tell them that I tried. I
 Jeremy. I... I hope you're
 Gonna stay strong. I'm not
 (Gasps)
 Nova Scotia? Damon, you're a genius.
 It's day 278 inside this stupid prison world. I have two broken toes, nine blisters, and an ear infection, but I don't care. I have phesmatosed the crap out of this magic Canadian rock, and I have my magic again. And when that eclipse hits 12 28, I'm going home. You hear that, me? Home. (Drinks)
 This is it. I'm ready. There's no one to stop me. I have magic and the ascendant and the eclipse.
 No. No!
 Okay. Clearly, I've been dropped into a snowy tundra hell dimension. Either that or I finally had a psychotic break.
 Incendia!
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, God. (runs for the hole)
 I can do this. The Northern Lights, the eclipse, they're both recurring events. Come on, come on. Sangina mearma, ascendarum cavea. Sangina mearma, ascendarum cavea. Sangina mearma, ascendarum cavea. Sangina mearma-
 Who are you?
 One and only.
 Watch this. I didn't know it was still on when I got pulled out.
 Just wait.
 Who are you?
 There. Stop. (pauses to get a clear view of the woman)
 What?
 Looks like you could use a friend.
 
 My not-flannel blouse, my not-flannel t-shirts, and ooh! Ooh! I really missed my not-flannel V-neck.
 
 Can we talk about the fact that I drove Jeremy away to art school?
 Do me a favor? Don’t tell him I’m back yet.
 I just... I want to give him a chance at normalcy 
 And I will, I’ll tell him. Coming back to life is complicated. Trust me, I’ve done it before. Besides, we have a roommate without her humanity and in need for a severe intervention.
 I got out.
 
 
 
 I'm actually looking for someone.
 Hey. Down, boy.
 Look, I really have to go find my friend.
 
 
 Gloating in one of my best friend's times of need? It's weird that I miss you.
 You think one phone call makes us friends?
 Yeah. Yeah. A disease.
 Well, if scorching some douchebag with my magic is okay, then, yeah! Peachy. 
 
 
 What was the favor?
 Hey! What are you doing here?
 
 Aah!
 Aah!
 
 
 
 Now I want to talk, so listen
 
 I want you to feel what I felt.
 You were there the first time he hurt me, an arrow through the stomach. But you weren't there for what happened next, when he chased me through the hospital. 
 Sound familiar? He lied, and then he stabbed me again!
 Then came the worst part, because when it was all over, he left me. Alone. 
 
 Hey, Jeremy, it's Bonnie. It's a really long story, but I'm back. Uh, I had this whole plan to drive out to New Mexico and surprise you... I don't know, show up as one of the models in your drawing class or something. 
 I'm not helping you. (She tries to shut the door in his face, but Damon sticks his leg through to block it)
 I hate Kai, and you know that, and the first thing you did when I got back was throw him in my face to fake-apologize.
 And here you are, less than 24 hours later, asking me to work with him.
 If I give you my blood, will you just get out of my face?
 If you're sincerely looking for a way to make up for the hell that you put me through, this is it.
 Okay. So what's the catch?
 I would rather die of cholera than spend an afternoon with you.
 Yeah. You know, he's no longer a thing, and neither is that joke.
 Right, which is why there's two of us. Shall we?
 You guys go ahead. Kai and I will start the locator spell on the Ascendant.
 I'll be fine. He's good now, remember? New leaf.
 Hell no. But Damon and Elena need to meet his mom alone. So shut up and let's find the ascendant.
 Phasmatos Tribum, Nas Ex Veras, Sequitas Sanguinem. Phasmatos Tribum, Nas Ex Veras, Sequitas Sanguinem.
 The Ascendant is this way.
 The spell feels stronger. The Ascendant must be around here somewhere.
 I don't know, I didn't put it here.
 Because maybe you're right. Maybe, deep down, there's a part of me that believes there's a sliver of good in you.
 Gaining your trust, and then stabbing you in the back? Feels pretty sucky, doesn't it?
 I almost killed myself because of you!
 So have I.
 Also known as our ticket out of here. You got it?
 Okay.
 Sangiema meam et nos mundo carcerema. Sangiema meam et nos mundo carcerema.
 Sorry. Awkward timing.
 I just wanted to thank you for helping me find closure today.
 We're never going back there, right?
 Good. Because I have something for you. A gift from 1994. I was gonna give it to you yesterday, but then you acted like an ass and you didn't deserve it.
 If it wasn't for your notes on the map of Nova Scotia, I would have never remembered there was magic on that island. There's a good chance that I wouldn't be here today. So, for my 1994 road trip, I got you a li'l something.
 I knew you were planning on getting it yourself, you had the whole route mapped down to the kilometer.
 Because my mom's surprisingly happy as a vampire, and because I have full faith that we'll get Caroline back to normal the old-fashioned way. But mostly, because I knew you wanted it for Elena.
 That's none of my business. I'm just finishing what you started. You can give it to her, or not. It's up to you.
 Hey. This is a surprise.
 Thanks. What is this?
 Clearly. So Elena told me that you guys found Caroline, which is great. Funny enough, she didn't mention anything about a cure for vampirism?
 I didn't! Apparently, neither have you.
 Quite a few, I am assuming... which makes me wonder how you had time to bring your bud a coffee. Hmm?
 Okay, but we're not letting her people out.
 You what?
 Damon, you were the one that said her friends are vampires who can do magic.
 The term is "freaks we've never dealt with before."
 Oh. So, that means she's gonna come looking for me!
 No, eventually they shut your power off! You better fix this before she becomes my problem. And don't ever show up here pretending to care about me again!
 Hey, Matt.
 Great. She's early.
 Just wait ten minutes, tell her I'm running late, and stall her 'til I find what I need.
 Still looking.
 I told you to stall her.
 When did they leave?
 Do you know how many places there are to hide things in this house?
 Incendia. Phesmatos de strutos avox addellum.
 Do not take another step.
 For the first time, I'm putting me first.
 Oh. You promise me? Is that supposed to mean something? This isn't about Kai anymore. The people that that this would free are a million times stronger than him and us, and don't get me started on the fun they would have with a newly-human Elena.
 What are you talking about?
 So your own mother is leveraging you? Guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Phesmatos de strutos avox addellum.
 If I hand this over to you, I am sacrificing myself. Again. I'm risking my life, again. I could end up dead, again!
 What do you want? For Elena to have a human life, to be happy, to grow old without you? If that's what you really wanted, you would have given her the cure by now. Am I wrong?
 I said, "Am I wrong?" I know you, Damon. I spent four months with you, day in and day out. We went to hell and back again  literally  and you're more scared now than I have ever seen you before. It's not about what happens if you don't give Elena the cure. You're scared about what happens if you do.
 If you think you can handle it  free a bunch of people who will want to kill me and anyone else who tries to stand in their way  then you can spend the next 70 years watching Elena grow old and die. If that's what you want, take it.
 SURPRISE!
 
 But now, she's MIA.
 
 I'm just saying, that's not exactly a Garden burger!
 
 So, are we gonna talk about it?
 Seriously? You're gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you? 
 Damon called me last night and he told me everything, including his insane plan to take it with you.
 He needed someone to talk to after you left the conversation without telling him what you were thinking!
 And I quote, "She stared at me like I was an alien, and then basically teleported out of the room."
 But you want to be human again.
 I think you should take it. Decision made.
 Or, what if the human-you doesn't love Damon anymore?
 
 Bad news  Damon hijacked Elena. So, do you want to take this party somewhere else?
 Oh, my God.
 Lily Salvatore.
 I didn't do it to spite you, Lily. I did it to keep Kai trapped.
 
 Now, let it go, and get out.
 Ungh!
 
 Elena?
 Lilly... I thought Stefan locked you in the cellar.
 What do you want?
 You want your creepy witch-vampire family back. Well, at the risk of repeating myself, there's no way.
 Hmm. Even if there is a loophole, I won't help you find it.
 Phesmatos incendia.
 Motus.
  How are you...
 Get Jo?
 Is everything okay?
 Do you want me to do a locator spell?
 Mm-hmmm.
 I don't know, actually. Just hang on, I got to figure out how to work this stupid thing.
 Hi!
 Oh!
 Said everyone who ever causes mischief.
 Is this like some Oedipus thing? All right, you know what? Doesn't matter.
 If you think, I'm gonna let you  a ruiner  in here to see another ruiner on the day of Jo's wedding, you got another thing coming.
 And she can't eat that.
 What?
 She was rambling on about her family, and then I got close to her, and she attacked me, like an animal.
 You're saying this is all because she's drying out?
 What happens when the crazy stage is over?
 Does that plan involve letting her out? Because if he thinks she's giving up on her family...
 What if there's a loophole?
 The dress is fine. I'm just being paranoid.
 I'll come!
 Yeah.
 Elena says she's desiccating and that's why she's crazy, but...
 I know this will sound crazy, but I've been having these nightmares with her and Kai...
 What's this?
 What do you think we should do?
 She's gonna kill us.
 Not Lilly, Caroline. The wedding starts in an hour.
 Enzo must have let her out. I have to warn everyone.
 Matt? Matt, what's wrong?
 Okay, just hang on, I'll...
 It was...
 Damon!
 Damon, Kai's out.
 He did. And I don't know how, but I'm still alive. He drained my blood and that's all.
 Oh my god.
 Stay there. Okay? I'm coming.
 I found it in the kitchen.
 Keep watching.
 I'm not letting Kai win!
 You need more than blood. Maybe some ointment? 'Cause gross.
 So, the sick humor's your thing, I'm just the one that does magic.
 Undo the spell, Kai.
 Ossox!
 Again!
 Fine. I'll just wait for the werewolf bite to kill you.
 No, no!
 Damon.
 Damon?
 Damon...
 Damon.
 Are we seriously having a sleepover?
 I'm so sorry, Elena. Really, I'm so sorry
 Okay.
 Drinken. Now.
 Amsterdam.
 
 Elena told me to keep a journal of everything she's missing! When she wakes up in sixty-odd years and finds out that Ric died from alcohol poisoning, she's gonna want to know what happened.
 Aw, so sweet.
 I'm gonna go rent a bike and see the city like a normal tourist.
 
 
 Lily won. As much as we did everything to stop her, she actually got her family back.
 
 Listen to yourself, Damon. Elena wants you to live your life!
 What's that supposed to mean?
 It's not bourbon. It's tea.
 Ric was right here! How did we lose him?
 
 So, where do you wanna go?
 Should we turn around, or should we go straight? Or make a left here...?
 Wow. Thank you!
 Hang on  did you see that truck coming?
 
 Three seconds? I could have died!
 
 
 
 I honestly don't know where I am.
 Matt, surrendering the town is not the solution. We need to stop them.
 So this is my fault?
 What are you doing here?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 So, the Great Mystic Falls Evacuation Plan isn't going as well as everyone hoped...
 Are you okay?
 ...Damon told me what you were doing in Europe.
 
 
 
 
 Where did you find it?
 
 The night you pretended to pass out on the floor of the bar?
 It's certainly pretty. I don't feel any magic emanating from it.
 Sometimes witches will conceal a powerful talisman or relic by hiding the magic inside of it.
 
 
 But your friend from Duke told you that, didn't she? Which is why you waited until you were flat-out desperate before you told me about it.
 You can't mess with that magic, Ric. We have to destroy it.
 
 I convinced him to drop it in a vat of acid, so I think we're good. How are you?
 
 
 It's because we killed Malcolm...
 This is all my fault.
 
 Hey.
 
 
 It's pretty brilliant, really. They drain the vervain from your blood, compel you to sign the deed, compel you not to let Stefan and Damon in, and compel you to forget any of it ever happened. And bingo, the house is an impenetrable fortress, and vampires can't rescue Caroline.
 
 Temporarily.
 No. Once you die, the threshold spell is broken. If they want to reseal the house, they'll have to sign over the deed to someone else.
 
 Six minutes. That's how long your heart can be stopped before anything bad happens to you.
 
 
 
 
 Come on, Matt! Phesmatos sanguine infundare cura. Come on, Matt!
 Thank God!
 I think we should go to the hospital, just in case.
 
 
 What you said yesterday? You were right. The Heretics are here because of me, and when I saw our town  our home  like this, I helped Damon kill Malcolm. When I found out they took Caroline, it was my idea to stop your heart. I refuse to stand by and let them do whatever they want.
 
 Did it work?
 
 
 Please tell me I'm not interrupting something...
 That Phoenix Stone that I touched yesterday... you did destroy it like you promised me, correct?
 I just had another vision  a flash of horrified people with x-shaped wounds on their skin. And, when I opened my eyes, ten minutes had gone by.
 
 I'm busy.
 
 Yeah, but after we get him to siphon away my visions.
 
 How do you know Damon?
 
 
 Yeah.
 
 
 Did you know he still had it?
 
 
 So the visions, the lost time, the crippling headaches... they don't mean anything? Doesn't it matter to you?
 You don't even know what this stone does... if it will work!
 
 
 Never lie to me again.
 So, what does a rock that makes you see screaming people have to do with reincarnation?
 
 Ric...
 ...I'll try.
 I didn't want to wake you.
 Hi!
 
 I'll work on unraveling the spell when I 
 Kind of worrying about magic already. Alaric think we can reunite Jo's spirit with her body by using some sketchy Native American resurrection stone. My job is to crush his dreams in the most gentle way possible.
 I don't think it should. The Other Side is gone, there's no more Gemini prison world, which means Jo's spirit... is probably at peace.
 Tell me about it.
 
 
 And the visions from that stone scare the hell out of me, so... Don't. Rush. Me.
 
 Oh. Scratch that one off the list...
 
 Oh, crap, Ric! Put it out!
 
 It's something I found in one of your shamanistic oral traditions...
 Oh, my God!
 Figured you might.
 
 Look at you sad-sacks! What, am I gonna say no? Damon, go get your girl.
 I'll get his.
 I guess, um... I've been thinking a lot about the past lately. How one stupid decision can...
 ...Can turn your life into something that you don't recognize. Like it belongs to someone else. I made a mistake, and I lost someone I loved... And I'd do anything to take it back, but I can't. All I can do is...
 ...Try and find a way to live with it.
 What are you doing here?
 Hey, how's she doing?
 Yesterday she was dead. Today she's alive. I'm not sure normal applies.
 Term papers. They were jamming up your inbox. You are still employed as a professor here.
 Tempting, but I need to figure out exactly how I brought your wife back to the land of the living.
 
 Is it safe to enter? Or is your boyfriend still half-naked under the sheets?
 Please! At least your bed has seen a half-naked male all semester. I think Ms. Cuddles is starting to feel sorry for me.
 I mean, look at her! Do you see how she's judging me?
 
 Valerie? The Heretic who turned your skin to vervain so you and Stefan couldn't touch?
 Wow. You're either completely insane, or the most secure woman in the world.
 
 
 
 
 See, now I think you're projecting. You're the one sleeping at Lily Salvatore's feet, hoping for some of her good table scraps.
 Um, I need to talk to Oscar.
 
 
 Hello, Oscar. Hey, do you remember me? We met in Myrtle Beach.
 Out of where?
 
 This stone. Know it?
 Good, I think. She was asleep when I left.
 
 
 
 
 
 Fine, but you owe me.
 I have to head back to Whitmore.
 
 
 I don't think so.
 Let's just say you were right  Oscar's not himself today.
 
 
 
 Maybe he'll tire himself out, and we just go out the front door?
 First, give me that stone back.
 
 
 Then you definitely don't need it. Do you really want to hand her the means to bring the dead boyfriend back into the picture? Have some dignity!
 I'm just saying  maybe you deserve better.
 
 You with Jo?
 It's not her, Ric. It's not Jo.
 We made a mistake. The stone doesn't bring people back from the dead. It is just an old relic full of souls.
 
 
 Guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree?
 You sure you wanna do this?
 So much for that new leaf, huh?
 You're doing right by Elena.
 
 Because I'm at Scull Bar, where faux-Jo is currently 
  Holding her laptop like it's a book. You promised me you would help her figure out who she was before she did anything crazy.
 I know this is probably impossible for you. We have no idea what's going to happen to her. We can't just leave her unattended.
 
 Oh, did whatever animal they're serving for dinner get a plus-one?
 You're scoping the competition.
 Sorry?
 
 It's called dignity. Have some! It's free.
 Lily is watching. I am fixing your tie. Making her jealous like any good date.
 That's what you wanted, right? Make her a little jealous?
 Oh... The entire town's shut down. You haven't noticed the million signs?
 Yeah, I heard you the first time. Why?
 Who've you been talking to?
 I don't know, but I get the impression he didn't, either. We should follow him.
 Unless you have other plans...?
 He didn't actually see us... did he?
 It's not gonna work, Matt. Someone compelled them to be here.
 
 Are we talking about Oscar's car, or Lily?
 You're not doing this to stop a psychopath. You just want the girl.
 Let me give you some advice. Stop treating Lily like some prize to be won.
 
 Found it.
 I think I've seen that before... when I was doing research on the stone. Let me see what I can dig up.
 
 I know what's not gonna happen  Lily falling hopelessly in love with the person who murdered her sweetheart.
 
 Now that I think about it... Go ahead and kill each other. Win-win for me!
 Oh. You're here.
 
 
 This one.
 Uh, actually, I'm just gonna do my research here if that's okay with you?
 Great.
 ...Do you want to talk about it?
 
 So, uh, Enzo found some sword in Oscar's car and is under the impression it will kill Julian.
 Found it. This is it. Except it's...
 Does that look like the Phoenix Stone to you?
 Okay.
 "The stone gives the sword its power against immortal foes. Without it, the blade is merely a blade."
 Oh no.
 
 
 I heard today didn't go so well.
 So that's it? You're giving up?
 Good.
 You're better off without her.
 "Hey, Stefan. Did I mention Bonnie saw me mix a blood bag with a jar of mayonnaise at 2 00 in the morning?"
 Fair. Why not just tell him?
 If you can handle all of this while pregnant, I can handle a fraction of it while not. Go to your class.
 Nora. How unexpected. What are you doing here?
 You shouldn't have.
 
 Okay. You delivered it. Yay! That's the end.
 I'll tell them.
 And you're still not leaving...
 
 
 
 Collection booth. The far one, like, way over there.
 Yeah. You see it? See?
 Hello, Damon.
 What a lovely way to be greeted. "Hi, Bonnie. I need something."
 Yeah. I've already done a locator spell.
 It doesn't work that way, Damon.
 Hmm. Actually, there might be something I can do.
 I'll text you in a bit.
 Professor Dowling or Marcus?
 You're taking freshman English, right? Who's your professor? Please tell me it's Dowling and not Marcus.
 Oh, I know you can. Which is why I'm saying take Dowling. I don't want Professor Marcus to end up dead. I'm joking... sort of.
 Close. Bourbon. I'm sorry I was harsh earlier. I heard you listened to Valerie and that you sided with Lily against Julian. I mean, you must be attempting to turn over a new leaf, and you clearly don't have anyone else...
 
 ...Excuse me?
 
 So then they followed him to Ridley Park, Old Saybrook, and finally Sunbury.
 
 
 
 Guess it didn't go well...
 Why don't I get you a tissue?
 
 Can I ask you what might seem like a mean question?
 
 But just to you.
 I don't need someone to tell me I'm pretty.
 What?
 Damon? Hey. Please tell me you know who you are.
 Damon, say something.
 Good. Means I actually got the spell right for once.
 How do you feel?
 A day? Damon, you've been dead for three months.
 You sure you're okay? No desire to lash out or break anything?
 I'm fine. Just, weak. It took three Heretics to successfully find Julian's spirit in that stone, and I did it solo.
 Caroline's at Whitmore, Alaric's at a lecture, and Matt's on patrol. I'm sorry. It's been three months. I... it's not like...
 You're gonna need another.
 When Julian stabbed you, Nora stabbed Stefan, and I... I haven't been able to bring him back yet.
 
 
 
 He was just in here.
 Because he didn't walk out the front door.
 Someone took him.
 
 Uh, I guess we could find out.
 
 The spell worked. He's on Route 29.
 Damon?
 What is that for? Ugh. I'm fine. I'm just weak. You know, it took three Heretics to successfully find Julian's spirit in that stone.
 
 
 The spell's not working.
 I don't understand. It's like the stone is hiding his spirit.
 And who's fault is that? You, of all people, don't get to lecture me.
 
 Oh! UGH! Damon  Ahhh!
 
 No, I'm letting Stefan deal with Damon.
 
 Oh, my God.
 
 'Cause it just matched us.
 Okay, we gotta get you a new profile picture. Is that a gun?
 Okay, I'm not trying to be in your business, but maybe showing a softer side will get you more hits.
 Errox femus!
 Matt. Matt! Okay, he's dead.
 Okay. Come on. Let's get these bodies out of here.
 Are you kidding me? This is the best blackmail material ever.
 Hey. Wasn't sure you'd make it.
 Did you buy off the registry?
 Socks count as practical. Good. That's how we'll sell it to Caroline.
 Come on. I'll get you a drink. Although, fair warning, they're in baby bottles.
 
 
 I see her studying by herself every day. And honestly? I felt bad. So, I invited her. It's better to have a powerful Heretic as a friend than an enemy.
 No, I invited you. You should stay.
 
 In case it wasn't obvious, today was supposed to be a fresh start.
 What the hell is your problem? I was trying to be nice to you.
 Postcard? You have a pen pal.
 
 
 ...A sword.
 Then how do we stop her?
 
 Ohio? Are you sure this isn't a prank or something?
 But why announce herself with a cryptic postcard? Isn't the element of surprise a basic principle of good vampire hunting?
 Your vampire huntress is currently residing somewhere in Cincinnati.
 Do you think I just did that locator spell for a tune-up? I'm going with you.
 Uh, I wasn't asking. The last thing I need is a so-called ruthless killing machine going after any of my friends. I need to protect them, and it's not like I can trust either one of you to take her down.
 I call shotgun!
 I have a question  if Rayna was chasing you through Europe in the 19th century, how exactly is she still alive?
 
 No. But, feel free to try and be civil. Otherwise, we will be more than happy to drop you off at the side of the road, and you can hitch a ride back to whatever rock you've been living under.
 Nuthouse for the criminally insane. Sounds promising.
 So, do we actually have a plan here?
 Okay  this is your vicious, terrifying, big-bad Huntress? Got it.
 I'm Bonnie, she's Nora, that's Mary Louise. And you're Rayna, right?
 No, we're thinking this couldn't possibly be the woman we're looking for. She couldn't send a postcard, let alone kill a vampire.
 
 Go help her look for her.
 
 You're using me to make her jealous. And it's working.
 I'm tired of being in the middle of it, so just go help her look for her.
 Hard to believe they don't have vending machines in high-security psychiatric prisons, but I managed to snag you an oatmeal cookie... from someone else's meal tray.
 Bonnie.
 So you are the Huntress.
 
 
 
 What are you doing here?
 Where have you been? You just fell off the face of the earth.
 I didn't miss you, I'm curious as to your recent whereabouts. There's a difference.
 Matt did that?
 I'm fine, considering I was almost strangled to death by an 80-year-old psychopath.
 Did you know the Huntress was immune to magic?
 That lying little weasel.
 I need a drink. And a buddy.
 And currently you are my only buddy available to drink. You'll notice I'm overlooking the fact that you nearly killed me the last time we hung out, so thanks for that.
 Are you out of bourbon? How's that possible?
 Someone celebrating Julian's very timely demise?
 Stefan didn't tell you? Put a chair back through his heart.
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're too debauched to even notice he's missing.
 Anyway, on the subject of people who have gone missing, when was the last time you spoke to Enzo?
 Because yesterday, I got dragged into a very bad L Word rerun, starring Nora and Mary Louise, so we could track down Rayna Cruz, the big scary huntress... who, by the way, turned out to be eighty and senile... when all of a sudden, Enzo shows up out of nowhere and steals her corpse.
 What is this?
 And don't tell me it belonged to Carol Lockwood.
 I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't quite hear that. Was that Cr... Crys... ?
 Crystal.
 Got it.
 Krystal with a "K," hmm. Sounds like pure class. With a "K."
 Are you kidding me?
 The last thing anyone wants to deal with for the next six decades is a cranky, bitter, sexless Damon Salvatore, okay? Elena would never do that to us, which is why she gave you very clear instructions to live your life. And apart from your glaring lack of standards, this isn't a bad thing.
 Tell him I don't deal with shady old-lady corpse stealers.
 Of course he does. 'Cause shady people like shady tchotchkes. It's not happening.
 What?
 Well, now that we've got this thing, I want to know what Enzo has over you.
 Actually, I'm the one doing the solid. You're the one making me do the solid and now you're gonna tell me why.
 What did you do? Couldn't be worse than whatever was wearing that jean skirt.
 Fine. Just don't be surprised if I leave behind a really detailed journal entry for Elena that's all about Krystal with a "K."
 Damon, it's me. I'm your best friend! And when Alaric heads to Dallas, I might be your only friend.
 'Cause this isn't creepy or anything...
 I'm sorry. You are... ?
 
 No, I saw you. You were old and sick and dead.
 Hey, You didn't hesitate for one second... let alone three. Thank you.
 I think I hear something. Sounds like a low drone. Sounds like a traitor.
 Nora?
 
 I need you to calm down. Where are you?
 Wait, what?
 What is he talking about? What's going on? What don't I know?
 Damon, why is he so mad at you?
 She's here.
 How is she?
 ...Beau didn't get away.
 I don't know. But I think Rayna's somewhere inside this hospital.
 Not to make things worse, but my magic doesn't work on her, and I don't think Damon can take her alone.
 Stefan, you have to go.
 I'll stay and help Valerie. Damon needs you.
 I don't know what he did to make you hate him, but he is so determined to make things right, he's gonna get himself killed.
 Do you honestly think I would do anything to put Caroline at risk?
 Stefan, go. We can take it from here.
 Is she okay?
 Everything's fine. Babies are healthy, they're with Alaric. He took them to the nursery to get them checked out.
 
 Valerie said she just lost cell reception with Stefan.
 You told Stefan you would find a way to get him off the hook with Rayna, and I told Caroline I'd make sure you didn't screw it up. So, we both have a lot riding on this.
 
 
 Okay, we're in.
 So, this faceless, so-called "Armory" claims to know where you come from?
 And, if you have to lie, or hurt your friends, or screw anyone over in the process, so be it, right?
 What are you doing?
 UGH!
 
 
 Ohh... What did you do to me? Why won't my magic work?
 Open it!
 
 At least that person knew what he wanted, and fought for it without steamrolling everybody else.
 And you want your family. A family who dropped you at a work house, never came looking for you, who wiped all trace of their existence from your life. You're willing to make an enemy out of everyone for them?!
 Good. I hope you find it.
 Oh, my God! Damon!
 
 
 
 This is what happens when you make enemies, Enzo. For the record, I would have been a better friend.
 Looks like you could use a hand.
 I need to get you out of here.
 
 Tyler! Tyler, stop!
 Not great, but... good enough to make sure you never call me that again.
 Someone's cheery.
 Which is...?
 Does it have to do with killing Rayna the Huntress?
 Good. How can I help?
 It's Damon versus Cray-na, because that one gets you right back in Hell. You don't even know how to kill her.
 But, you know who might?
 Enzo's been calling me non-stop  probably to apologize for yesterday. I bet if I go back to the Armory, I can find out more info.
 What the hell?
 So, did it grow back, or...?
 Less concern, more curiosity...
 I did. And, I'm not stupid enough to think that your apologies were anything other than a tactic to get you here. But, here I am.
 Fair warning  if you try to disable my magic again, you'll wish I only cut off your hand.
 Mmm, I forgot. You two used to be friends. And now you have none.
 
 But you don't want to fight her. You want her captured. So, I think you know a lot more than you're letting on. Makes it hard for me to trust you.
 You mean two Everlastings. The other six look pretty "lasted."
 i take it from her subtle shift in attitude that's a bad thing?
 
 I didn't do anything. Damon, on the other hand 
 
 
 
 The sword. It has linking magic. It creates a bond between Rayna and her victims.
 We knew that.
 The scars are...
 ...A fail-safe. If Rayna dies... so does anyone she's marked.
 Where's Rayna?
 
 
 The wounds from her sword? It's linked to her victims. If Rayna dies one last time... so does Stefan.
 You said she gets stronger each time she comes back to life. Damon can't kill her. He's walking into a fight he can't win.
 Not soon enough. She's connected to an Everlasting. Maybe I can weaken it... and her.
 
 Yeah, I do.
 You weren't even gonna say goodbye?
 Enzo told me you asked him for Elena's coffin. He told me what you were planning. I didn't believe him. I thought... "If Damon desiccates until Elena wakes up, I'll never see him again."
 "He'd never do that."
 Are we friends?
 
 Are we friends?
 I know why you wanted to do this in a letter  so you could desiccate in peace, imagining whatever reaction you wanted. Me reading it and thinking, "Huh. I'm really gonna miss him." Well, too bad, because that's not my reaction  this is. I am not okay with this decision. I'm not okay with you choosing yourself. And I'm not okay with never seeing you  my best friend  ever again.
 This hurts me. This hurts... this hurts me...
 Hmm. And as you desiccate, and as you feel the pangs of hunger as the blood drains from your body, that's what I want you to remember. That you hurt me.
 No. No. You don't get to say goodbye.
 ...How one stupid decision can turn your life into something that you don't recognize.
 Thing is, I cared about him more than anyone else in the world... But it wasn't enough. I mean, he walked away like it was the easiest thing in the world to do. Then, I find out he's back and hasn't bothered to contact me. I think, "How could I have fallen into such a dark place over someone who cares so little about me?"
 I've decided I'm ready to move on. I'm not gonna let that betrayal define the rest of my life.
 Thanks. Can you check to see if I've got any messages for my doctor?
 What are you doing?
 
 Because none of us are gonna get well if we can't think straight. You just seemed to be in a weird fog. I wanted to help.
 Yeah, sure.
 So, how'd you end up in here?
 Oh, no. Damon was not my boyfriend. He was... I don't know what he was.
 So, what happened with your family?
 
 
 No! Your sister Alex is looking for me. The whole Armory is looking for me.
 I have no idea. I faked a story and checked myself into this place a few weeks ago, hoping you could help me figure it out. They've been hunting me for almost three years.
 
 
 I found a way to hide from them. That, I can prove, if you promise to keep my secret.
 
 If I take one of these every day, they can't do a locator spell on me. The downside is, I don't have access to any magic.
 You ever hear of a vampire hunter named Rayna Cruz? They used her blood to make the pills I've been taking. If you help me, you'll be free to move away.
 Now tell me why the Armory is looking for me.
 I have a doctor who can check us both out, but not before you tell me what I need to know.
 
 I was officially dead for a while. Then I wasn't.
 It was a long story. What's in this vault?
 
 If this vault is the key to my freedom, I can't promise you anything until I know what's in it.
 What are you doing?!
 AHH! OW!
 Yeah.
 It's just a scratch, Doctor. But it was all worth it, because guess who knows why I'm on the Armory's Most-Wanted list?
 Turns out, there's some kind of vault in the basement of that pretentious building  sealed by a Bennett witch. Alex St. John wants me to open it.
 Now, we just have to figure out what's inside and the best way to leverage my freedom... After you check me out of this place and take me out for dinner, because if I have to eat another piece of runny, beige casserole, I might actually lose my mind.
 What's wrong?
 I got a lead, not all the answers. I still need to stay off the Armory's radar.
 What are you talking about? I feel fine?
 
 I'm gonna die? Is that what you're trying to tell me? Because I've done it once or twice before, and it's not all that fun...
 What is going on?
 Thank you.
 Oh...
 
 And I can't believe this is happening.
 Do I have to open the door?
 Great.
 No. You don't speak to me. You speak to Enzo. If you have any ideas how to keep me from dying, I'm sure he'll be happy to hear them, but I don't want to hear one word from your mouth directed at me. You lost the right to my attention when you decided to leave without saying goodbye.
 You're driving.
 He can follow.
 Lots of words can be spoken. I just don't want him to speak any to me.
 
 Anger returns. Anger floods. I'm flooded.
 You know what? He's welcome to go back to his musty old mansion far away from here.
 
 Get off!
 Yeah? You got a funny way of showing it! Secluded cabin? Anti-magic sedatives?
 
 Oh, can Enzo not read?
 If I don't?
 
 Okay. Say I take you up on this protection, for now. If I stay here... I set the ground rules.
 Hey. Look.
 The girls are growing up so fast.
 Blueprints of the Armory's underground levels. You ever been down there?
 I wonder what's down there. The Armory collects things, right? Every museum has an archive where they keep the really good stuff.
 I don't know. Unique things. One-of-a-kind things. The outliers of a collection.
 Uh-huh. I mean, maybe that's why they wanted Elena.
 And Rayna Cruz.
 And me.
 Every day I mean to, and every day I decide not to.
 
 Shut up. This thing has a kick!
 What?
 
 This is the best I could do...
 If you would've told me a year ago we would be spending New Year's Eve together, I would have called you crazy.
 So, I was thinking about your cousin  whatever you want to call her. Alex? How you said she never wanted to discuss her siblings. But her sister Virginia's journal talks about how close they were.
 Kind of off-balance. Seems to hate everything your family stands for.
 Why do you care? Hmm? They abandoned you. Left you at a workhouse.
 Nothing.
 Nothing.
 
 'Really?
 Why the hell not?
 So, when I was reading the journal...
 It's all I have to occupy me.
 
 Not all. Not counting guitar practice.
 And the fire-building.
 And now this! Old-people dancing.
 It's not even midnight yet.
 Forgot. Being a double agent must be a full-time job.
 Happy New Year.
 I just picture your face as the target.
 
 I'm tired, Damon. And I don't feel good and I'm worried about Enzo, so stop trying so hard, okay?
 Please tell me you're alright.
 
 Is she still looking for me?
 
 From what you know about the sickness, how much time do I have left after the, uh... first scab appears?
 Hilarious, as always. You stayed away long enough.
 Well, the fireplace is burning perfectly.
 And I found something in Virginia's diary.
 Yeah. She knew my cousin, Lucy Bennett.
 It's a bill from a psychiatric hospital in Asheville, North Carolina. Virginia's been a patient there for the past three years. She might have an idea about why the Bennett bloodline is so important to Alex.
 New year, new me. A new mastery over an instrument.
 No?
 I was doing it!
 Don't be ridiculous.
 Nice try. Doesn't count.
 Don't kill him.
 He helped save Caroline's life, and her kids. I'm not gonna let you murder him.
 
 This is so like you.
 Damon!
 Do you really believe that? There's no other factor you can think of?
 But you did. And I got over it.
 Yeah. Yeah, I keep it.
 I keep it as a reminder to not trust the wrong people.
 Enzo has been there for me! Every single day. Hiding me. Protecting me.
 He'll figure it out!
 Then I'll die! But at least I'll do it with him by my side. I love him, Damon, And I know that no matter what happens, he won't leave me.
 Not to be a crybaby, but...
 These feel a lot worse than they look. Don't think I'll get much playing in.
 Go ahead. Go ahead!
 No, you're trying to look. Gonna make you... Go ahead.
 Impressive. No, you're peeking! You're totally peeking. No, I can see you're side-eyeing the guitar.
 Hi. I'm here to see a patient of yours, Virginia St. John.
 She tried to kill me. (said with a dry look upon her face.)
 I don't have a lot of time. And I need answers. Your sister Alex is hell-bent on having me open that vault. I need to know what's in it.
 What's in there?
 No one can survive four years sealed in a vault.
 I promise.
 See the crazy train has moved topside. Is that my shirt?
 Personally, I would've negotiated for the penthouse suite in Paris and dinner at the best restaurant in town where I would've ordered one of everything and had the most expensive bottle of wine and champagne.
 Guess I don't understand what you're getting out of this. I mean, not to sound ungrateful, but you're willing to die? For me? Just doesn't make any sense.
 Motus!
 Where's Enzo? He's not answering his phone.
 My magic's back. The Armory's one locator spell away from finding me.
 Yeah, here. I just want to say thank you.
 I still think it was wrong for you to abandon us, but I... I forgive you.
 Okay. I will.
 You ready?
 I'm not gonna let them use me to open that vault.
 We spent three years hiding. I can't let them find me.
 No, you're not. You're nowhere near done. I'm staring at a floor covered in names.
 Just come home.
 I don't want our last moments to be like this. You a million miles away. Connected only by some crappy cell phone signal. Whatever time I have left, I want to spend it with you. Here. So just come home. (Bonnie has given up; she cuts the phone off.)
 You came back.
 Hey. Don't be sad. I have decided, I'm not gonna be sad. I'm not gonna think about all the things we never got the chance to do together. I'm gonna be happy. I'm gonna think about all the things we... we did do together.
 Rayna?
 Rayna, what's happening?
 Rayna.
 I would rather that, than be forced to open that vault.
 Alex can't be trusted.
 Yup.
 Terra Mora Vantis Quo Incandis, per Vasa Quo Errum Signos. Phasmatos selvus Terra Mora Vantis Quo Incandis, per Vasa Errum Quo Signos. Phasmatos selvus nos ex malom terra mora Vantis Quo Incandis per Vasa Quo Errum Signos. Terra Mora Vantis Quo Incandis.
 It's done.
 Let's grab Caroline and Alaric and get the hell out of here. Come on. Now! Run! (They leave the Armory.)
 Phasmatos veras nos ex malom. Terra mora vantis quo incandis per vasa quo errum signos
 Kept my promise. No one's getting out.
 That soup is awful.
 I don't know. Just feel different.
 Okay, here's how I'm feeling  I'm thirsty and starving.
 Okay.
 I actually think I want a bourbon. Neat.
 New beginnings.
 Myth.
 This isn't real! 
 
 Get away from me. You're not real.
 Caroline. 
 I'm trying. I don't want to hurt you.
 
 
 I can't help it. All I see is you losing control. Hurting those little girls.
 And you have the nerve to call them your kids.
 Uh, I don't think so.
 Like I said, I don't think so. 
 
 So you're in control of what I'm seeing now?
 Meaning we could have gone anywhere? "Anywhere" means Paris, by the way. So why are we walking around in my old high school? I might ask you the same question. I guess I'm trying to find something to hold onto... A time before vampires were a part of my life. Take those stoners, Chad Carpenter used to annoy me after practice every day, but he was a jerk... not a vampire. It's like the spell is overriding who I was. Who I am.
 
 Yeah, I'm still wearing my cheerleading uniform.
 
 Then I'll die.
 
 Elena?
 Damon. 
 Leave me alone. You're literally the last person I want to see.
 I die.
 Thank me for what?
 Why? You usually don't bother.
 Not good enough. 
 Screw you, Damon.
 You're a monster.
 
 No, it's not okay. I'm not in control. I'm gonna come for you. Please, don't let it come to that. 
 I don't think there's a word to describe the depths of hatred I feel towards you right now. 
 Jokes. Dead man's last comfort. 
 Really? Is that why you're running through the woods scared? 
 Not only can I see you... 
 
 That's the thing, Damon. As you were so eager to remind me I'm never gonna have to explain myself to her. 
 
 You're too late. I'm not the person you used to know. 
 
 Then help me not do this. Keep me connected to my human side. 
 There is one condition.
 I need to kill Damon first. 
 Oh, they're real. Courtesy of Matt, who is also setting up a perimeter around the forest as we speak.
 Why is that?
 
 Giving up already?
 
 My grave, from Remembrance Day.
 What's that supposed to prove?
 I'm not the one that needs to be worried about that. 
 I'm gonna kill you.
 Stop doing this. I hate you.
 Stop talking.
 Ahhh! 
 I promise.
 No one's getting out.
 I get snippets of conversations. Some visuals. But mostly, I can feel them. Their emotions. They're scared. And they should be. The urges are getting stronger. I can feel it taking over. I don't want to hurt them.
 I know in my heart that I should. Sorry, Matt.
 I need you to drive faster.
 I'm gaining on you. Tell Stefan to drive faster and don't stop. (Stefan raves the engine.)
 We have a police siren, okay? It's been helpful.
 Tell me we're not on 60.
 Oh, no.
 Why do I feel you getting closer?
 I can't do that.
 I'm sorry.
 Matt? Matt, are you okay? You okay?
 Of course I am. Because if I were dead, then this would all be over and everyone could go back to their lives. But we're not that lucky.
 So this is just gonna go on forever.
 You're human, Matt. You don't belong in this fight.
 I'm sorry.
 Calling to apologize from my leg? I know what you're planning. I can see everyone waiting at the Armory. They're sitting ducks, Enzo.
 What are you doing?
 No.
 I'll catch you, Enzo. Give me some credit.
 Okay. I see you.
 Why did you stop?
 Enzo...
 You know I can't do that.
 I'm so sorry.
 I know.
 Fight me. Fight me! Push me off of you.
 Hold me back. Please, please.
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Enzo.
 I love you, Enzo.
 I can't hold back anymore.
 He did it. Damon did it. He did it, he did it.
 If you think this means you're forgiven...
 You're kind of forgiven.
 Thank you.
 Hello?
 What did you just say?
 Damon. Elena is in a warehouse in Brooklyn.
 Where is he?
 So open it.
 I did.
 Enzo?
 Enzo!
 Enzo!
 
 
 
 
 I broke it.
 
 Thank you.
 
 
 
 Stefan... every time we do this, I let myself hope a little. And when we end up back at zero, my heart crushes in on itself a little bit more. I don't know how much my heart has left, you know?
 Of course. But... don't ask me to have hope. Hope hurts, and I don't want to hurt anymore.
 That's not wire... It's guitar string.
 They're still processing the scene. It shouldn't be much longer.
 What is that?
 I'm on my way.
 Get him in the car while I find Enzo.
 We're not leaving without Enzo.
 Let me go, Damon!
 Enzo.
 You haven't said a word. I know that was hard. But that wasn't Enzo. That wasn't Damon. They're not in control. But all those clues... The guitar string and the odometer... Enzo left them for me, I know it. He wanted us to find them. Next time, we'll get them back from whatever it is that has a hold of them.
 Not twelve hours ago, you were telling me, have hope. You were right.
 No. No, you were right. You told me there was hope. Now, just take a minute, pull yourself together and go find yours.
 
 Oh. I think I remember this. The Sirens lured the sailors into shore with their song before they ate them.
 
 He left me all these clues pointing to an old story about the Sirens. You have a few more degrees than I do  what do you know about them?
 Something has control over him. Do you think Sirens could be real?
 
 
 
 He left me all these clues pointing to an old story about the Sirens?
 That wasn't Enzo, that's wasn't Damon. They're not in control. And all those clues, he wanted us to find them. Next time we'll get them back from whatever it is that has ahold of them.
 I'm not hungry, thanks.
 I will... later. Right now, we need to be looking for crimes farther away from Tennessee. They might have been traveling these past few days.
 Then why hasn't he left anymore?
 There. North Carolina. Two murders in two different towns just this morning.
 Was there anything strange found at the crime scene?
 What makes you say that?
 Hang on. I think know this story. Damon killed a pregnant lady. Worst thing he's ever done.
 So why would Damon target Sarah?
 So you think it was Enzo's idea.
 Let me know when we get close to Raleigh.
 Nice to see you, too.
 So this is the new you? Long silences and cryptic messages?
 Not to nitpick, but you could've just written the word "siren."
 We are talking about a living, breathing siren, right? Like, mermaid monsters who sing to sailors?
 What does she want with you?
 Why you and Damon?
 Okay, what's her weakness? How do we stop her?
 What? Why? You're safe now.
 Enzo...
 Am I important? It's hard to tell these days.
 Is that why Sarah's a target?
 Okay, we'll text you when we're out front.
 Why can't you stay gone, huh? Why can't you just fight her?
 Yes.
 And no.
 I did what I needed, for once.
 No. I'm gonna get you as far away as I can.
 What's wrong?
 Hey, hey. Hey. Hey, you're gonna be okay.
 So we'll break you free.
 I'm not gonna let you out of my sight. I can't lose you again.
 Please stay.
 What happened? Did Stefan get Sarah out of town?
 I screwed up. I shouldn't have taken off with Enzo.
 He's not. I, uh... couldn't break him away from the siren's mind control, and I had to let him go back to her.
 And I needed to rescue my boyfriend.
 I had a plan, too. I had a plan to grow old with Enzo and come home to him every night. I had a plan to live the kind of life that you and Stefan are living right now.
 No. I'm happy that you're happy. I am. When I see everything that you have... your home, your boyfriend, your kids, your life... it makes me feel so alone that I want to die.
 I hate myself for it, but, yeah.
 None of this is your fault.
 Is Sarah okay?
 If you're gonna leave, then leave. I'm not gonna watch you.
 We are talking about a living, breathing thing siren.
 What does she want with you?
 Surprise!
 You are engaged, and we are celebrating. (giggles)
 First, we're gonna drink too much champagne. And then, I am taking you wedding dress shopping. I know it's a little early, but you're gonna try on thousands of dresses before you find the perfect one, so we may as well start now.
 I'm not putting it on. I'm not, I'm happy for you. I promise. Care, you asked me to be your bridesmaid when we were ten years old. You've been waiting for this your whole life. I'm happy for you. I swear.
 First things first, planning your June wedding.
 The June wedding. And...
 How else was I gonna out-Caroline-Forbes Caroline Forbes?
 You're welcome.
 Yay! Okay, now that I have a drink in you, I have to ask. Mm-hmm? How did Ric take the news?
 Aw, I'd be honored to be your... maid of honor. And not just because my main competition is in a coma till I die.
 Yup.
 Just leave me alone or I'll scream. I know what you are, Damon. One more move and I'm gonna take you out.
 Everything that happens is his fault.
 Get out!
  I'm sure there are a million people we'd both rather be with right now, but...
 Do you think it'll hurt?
 Stefan, if Damon wants me dead, then I'm dead.
 He's gonna be your brother-in-law. And, likely, Stefan's best man. Sorry.
 Scrapbooking's not really my thing. What do you want?
 No.
 No.
 I have no idea.
 I get it. You're jealous. You see a love that you didn't have to siren someone into. A love that isn't all about you. You're threatened. So, naturally you have to destroy it in the most sadistic game you can imagine. Forget it. Not playing.
 Oh, it's reminding you to put your seatbelt on.
 No offense, but you got to admit that seems a little small for a mythological creature of your stature.
 No.
 Oh. Yeah.
 Guess now she has to walk.
 No, Sybil's right. Stefan's gonna protect Damon no matter what. I can't help him. I have no power. She's right. There is no one who can fight for him.
 Damon, no. Damon? Please. Please fight through this. I know you can. Damon, he's your friend. Stop!
 Damon! Damon, don't make me do this.
 I choose Enzo!
 I know that somewhere deep down, there's still some part of you left. She couldn't have stripped it all away. You're... obnoxiously too stubborn to let that happen. I know my friend is still in there, and I'm gonna have to live with that. I just can't let him die. I choose Enzo.
 Don't trust her.
 Enzo. Don't.
 What are you doing?
 No. No. No, no.
 No. No. No, no.
 Damon, Stop! Please.
 I'll be fine.
 I said I'll be fine.
 If it were up to you, you would have picked Damon.
 And you would've done it knowing that Enzo was the one fighting Sybil. The one risking his life to help us.
 Let me ask you something. What has Damon done? Besides give up.
 We are talking about a living, breathing siren.
 I'm fine.
 Your wrists look a little raw. I'll help you out.
 I'm actually not. I still don't have my magic, but it doesn't mean that I can't use a magical object. This is a Dark Object on loan from the Armory. It's called a Flame of Imprisonment.
 It traps supernatural beings in the space where it burns. I can come and go because I'm the one who lit it. And I'm the ONLY one who can put it out. And I won't... unless you turn your humanity back on.
 Because Tyler Lockwood is dead and I'm not gonna lose you too.
 Sorry I wasn't there. I wanna be there. I just... I can't leave.
 It's worse, if that's even possible. Drying him out didn't work. Starving him didn't work. I played the guitar. I told him our history. It's like talking to a brick wall. What did it for you, when you had your humanity off? What made you break free ?
 Yeah... it is.
 Yeah.. when will that be ?
 I hope so, too.
 Why don't you just turn your humanity back on?
 You were a lot of amazing things, too. You were loyal, creative and wildly romantic.
 I'll be back.
 Screw you.
 I'm glad you found a new way to amuse yourself.
 I'm gonna get through to you. I'm gonna use your darkest fears to pull you out of this.
 Oh, well. Guess I'll die trying.
 You're afraid of people leaving. Period. You're afraid of being abandoned. The one thing that happens to you again and again. Everyone leaves, no one stays. Hmm. Well, that ends now. 'Cause I'm not going anywhere.
 Well, desperate times call for desperate measures. I'm not leaving until you turn your humanity back on. I'd rather burn alive than abandon you.
 I'm not leaving you.
 No. (coughing)
 I'm not leaving you.
 I'm not leaving you.
 I'm... not... leaving... you.
 I'm not... (fire roaring, glass shattering)
 Enzo! You came back to me.
 No... No!
 No! I'm not leaving you.
 It's okay.
 It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.
 I'm still here. Look at me. You're okay now. You're okay. And you're stuck with me forever. 'Cause I'm never leaving.
 Tyler was willing to sacrifice everything for us.
 I'm not leaving until you turn your humanity back on. I'd rather burn alive than abandon you.
 You came back to me. You're okay now. And you're stuck with me forever.
 You have no idea how much I missed you.
 Don't you forget it. (They kiss. Bonnie gets up and gets dressed.)
 Oh, admit it, you find my high school bedroom sexy.
 I'm blowing up. They're all from Caroline.
 Not so sure anymore.
 Enzo! Enzo? Enzo! Enzo. Enzo!
 I need help.
 Can you see her? Can you talk to her?
 You can get inside his head. Right? Like you've done with mine?
 What did you see?
 What are we gonna do? We have to help him.
 Do it. Just be careful.
 Good.
 I couldn't eat if I wanted to. I love him so much. And I'm terrified of losing him.
 Not so sure he escaped.
 I know. I just fought so hard to get you back, and... here you are, still suffering for what Sybil put you through. I hope you know how much I appreciate how hard you fought to get back to me.
 How did you keep fighting so long after Damon broke?
 But... you're not. You're kind. And you are loving.
 So... basically, I'm an angel.
 Ah, I love it. 
 I'm sorry. I know we're late.
 What do Sybil and Damon want?
 She stole it from us.
 From where? For all we know it's in the trunk of her car.
 We have no idea where that is.
 She's not gonna just tell you.
 Okay. We'll look it up. Are you guys okay?
 It's times like these I really miss Elena. If she were here, Damon wouldn't be doing any of this.
 Caroline? Caroline?
 Hey. You sure this is it?
 She picked a place with an owner. I'll be fine. I can do it.
 Enzo, no!
 Okay. We'll just leave, then.
 We're fine, Ric. Seline just wants to talk to you. She won't give us the weapon unless we got you on the phone.
 Georgie Dowling? Ric's intern?
 Stefan Salvatore? Are you sure?
 Thank you.
 Ahh!!
 You seriously couldn't hear that?
 It gave me a splitting headache. Ric said it hurt the girls' ears, too. Maybe it's a signal that only witches can hear.
 My Grams used to say that all witchcraft was rooted in psychic energy. Before I knew I had magic, I believed I was psychic.
 And that's what the sirens are. And Cade. Oh, gross, we're all connected.
 Um, you should know that I bought you T-shirts. Figured you were tired of me sleeping in yours. You're taking me to Paris, and I bought you T-shirts. T-shirts! I suck.
 Bonjour.
 And drank all the wine. And bought all the gifts.
 But don't open it now. Save it until Stefan comes back. The gift is kind of wedding themed.
 Thank you. Enzo gave it to me on our last night in Paris.
 Yeah. It's filled with blood. Enzo's. (gulps)
 Morbid? Charming? "A mere symbol of an eternity with you, love."
 Don't worry, I'm not... I'm not turning into a vampire any time soon.
 Why would psycho siren-nanny call you?
 And we care because...?
 What's the striker? It's an iron ball.
 Hey. Okay, those are the last names on the guest list. Perfect.
 Or we could ask him in person.
 Thanks for coming. Sybil just sirened that girl. I know it.
 We've been together almost three years and never once have you played the immortal card on me. Is it maybe because you gave me a vial of literal immortality to wear around my neck at all times? Was that maybe more than... just a symbol?
 Okay. Your exact words were, "I can't imagine life without you."
 Mm-hmm. And I can't imagine losing you either, but...
 I cannot become a vampire, Enzo. My life is still linked to Elena's. When Kai put her to sleep, he said no loopholes, no witchy-woo. Fact is, we don't know what would happen if I turned. Can't do it. Even if I wanted to.
 Would I become a vampire for you?
 You know, it's funny, 'cause a year ago, I would have been offended by the question.
 Oh, it's more than that. I've watched Damon and Stefan, Caroline and Elena, struggle with it for so long. And all I saw was how hard it was for them to just... live.
 I fell in love with a vampire who makes me feel alive.
 Together, always. If becoming a vampire just meant that you and I would be together forever? Yes, I would turn for you. But that's not all it means to me. I can't wear this...
... if it's a promise of anything more than my love for you.
 Come on, let's go back.
 This again? Enzo, Caroline needs me.
 That's not your decision to make. What's going on with you? This isn't you. You trust me. You listen to me. Why have you been watching me like a hawk since we got back from Paris?
 When did you become such a sap?
 It was wrong of me to give you back the necklace.
 Symbol or not... I never knew what it was like to want to be with someone forever till I fell in love with you. It's just...
 Our forever is just gonna have to be 60 to 70 years.So we have to make it count.
 What if it wasn't just my forever? What if it could be ours?
 What if you could take the cure?
 Damon, he's your friend! Stop!
 I'm not okay with never seeing you ever again.
 
 Translation - you are still in bed, moping about Stefan.
 I'm jogging. I needed to get out, clear my head.
 Enzo. I need your advice. You want to grab breakfast?
 Fine. Breakfast in bed it is. How do you like your eggs?
 Damon?
 Get down here, Caroline.
 Now.
 What do you think happened to him?
 Only one way to find out. Can you jump us both in there?
 Not a chance.
 What was that?
 Then that's what Damon's feeling. Look, he's suffering.
 What did you do to him?
 You're crazy if you think we're letting you out of this cell. You'll mess with our heads, too.
 We already tried going inside his head, remember? Didn't go well.
 Guess the inside of Damon's head looks a whole lot like the outside. Okay, come on. Shouldn't take long.
 We're looking for Damon Salvatore.
 I take it back. This might take a minute.
 Hold on a sec. You're Henry. Damon told me he saved your life during the War, so where is he?
 He didn't say anything because he wasn't there.
 Damon's in here, all right. If this is his subconscious that means he's responsible for everything that happens, including this animal attack.
 All we have to do is follow the clues and they should lead us right to him.
 I forgave him before. I can do it again.
 That's creepy.
 She's leaving, c'mon. Let's follow her.
 I'll tell you what, I'll talk to Vicki, you talk to your Mom.
 I know. But if I were you I'd still have some things to say.
 Hey, Vicki, wait up.
 You haven't seen Damon Salvatore, by any chance, have you?
 Are you sure? Maybe he had something to do with that bandage on your neck?
 I thought that he maybe...
 Is that what I think it is?
 Caroline?
 I didn't know if you'd be here. Wow, he even, he even got the sweater right.
 I need your help Grams.
 My friend's in trouble. I need you to do a locator spell.
 Damon Salvatore.
 They're brothers.
 It's way too late for that. Pretty much all of my friends are vampires now. I'm even in love with one.
 I've never been this happy Grams. I'm so close to the life I've always wanted. Please help me find Damon so I can get back to it.
 He wrote me a letter, once. He was trying to apologise to me. Must be around here, somewhere.
 And it's Damon's head. And that means if you're willing to help, deep down Damon wants me to find him. But if he ever wants me to know what this says he's gonna have to read it to me himself.
 Damon, is that you?
 You can't make me leave.. Damon led me to this crypt because he wanted me to find a way to save him.
 Damon's done a lot of things, Tyler. Things he's gonna have to spend the rest of his life atoning for. And I know that's scary but I believe he can do it. He just has to believe he can.
 I'm sorry, Tyler, that is not how this place works. And I just figured out how it does.
 You need to get Stefan back here.
 Because, in Damon's mind, he lived and died as a human being. He never became a vampire. It's the only way he can imagine keeping the people he loves safe.
 So our forgiveness isn't what matters. Damon needs to talk to Stefan.
 Don't worry. All you're gonna find in there is the truth.
 Hey, stranger.
 It's fine. I'm reflecting on the good things for a change.
 What you did while you were under Sybil's control wasn't your fault, Damon. You didn't have a choice.
 Gotta admit, it's a hell of a letter.
 What if you could take the cure?
 It's Mystic Falls' attempt to be hipster. If you want simple, go for the straight drip.
 Good luck. 
 Oh!
 Yeah, I'm fine. Just a supernatural ringing in my ears. That fork-bell combo packs a nasty psychic punch.
 
 Caroline found my sixth grade bucket list.
 My tweener dreams were not that sophisticated. "Meet Justin Timberlake, audition for American Idol, be on MTV's Spring Break..."
 Okay, don't mock my tweener self. What's on your bucket list?
 There has to be something or... things you really want to do. Some daredevil thrills you haven't tried.
 Then let's do them or as many of them as we can. You need to take full advantage of the perks of your immortality.
 Exactly. No time like the present.
 We'll still end up at the same destination. Why not make the journey an adventure?
 Mmm. Happy is a good look on you.
 What's next?
 You tell me. There's got to be more on your bucket list than drag racing.
 Okay. I think there's a place about an hour away.
 If you're gonna take the cure, if you're gonna become human, I just want to make sure there's nothing you missed out on.
 Yeah.
 Yeah? What'd you expect? You face-planted onto it after that BASE jump.
 I bought it a few months ago, with money my dad left me. No one knows about it. e can stash the bell here.
 I didn't buy the house for you.
 Probably not.
 You are forgetting one very important thing. 
 Was it enough?
 Oh, don't worry. You'll be a stupid human soon. If that's what you still want.
 I don't know. Up until recently, your existence as a vampire never included anything good. Maybe you need more time to live your vampire life to its fullest.
 You do not have to do this for me.
 What do you mean?
 About that...
 'Might be' isn't very convincing.
 I finally have Enzo, minus all the insanity. We're gonna start a life together. 
 You understand what you're asking me to do?
 Sorry, I just wanted to put myself first, for once. I just wanted to be happy.
 There has to be a loophole.
 Yeah.
 I had her moved from the Brooklyn warehouse after you and Damon went missing... for her safety.
 He's right. It's not the time to be selfish. Defeating Cade is more important. We're so close to everything we wanted. It's right here... and we can't have it.
 I never get to have my chance. Always give it up. Always do the right thing... for everyone else.
 No. No, I want to help. I want to use it on Cade. It just sucks.
 I'm sorry I built up this whole future that we might not get to see.
 Oh.
 Enzo!
 Come inside. I invite you in.
 I'll try.
 Yeah. It just feels so weird to be doing this to her. I'm not exactly an expert at drawing blood.
 How much blood should I take? oes the cure have a minimum dosage? 
 Let go of me.
 And you're gonna be human. 
 Enzo? 
 You're gonna be human. 
 She's okay. Elena's okay.
 He's gone. Enzo's gone.
 He's dead. Your brother killed him.
 No! Stay away! Stay away from me.
 I already did.
 I gave him the cure. He's human now.
 Enzo?
 Mom? 
 I don't think he wants me to. I still feel him. Like he's calling out to me. Or I'm losing my mind.
 Ugh, this isn't grief. I know grief. This is different. If he's trying to reach out to me, there has to be a way to reach him.
 There must be a way. You came back here for a reason. Let this be it.
 What are you doing?
 To where?
 You mean hell?
 If ENZO's in there and we bury him, he'll be trapped. There must be a way to free him.
 I'm not gonna leave you in there. I'll find a way.
 No! Enzo! No! Enzo! 
 He was trying to reach me!
 He's alone in darkness.
 How long have you been waiting there?
 Liar.
 I don't think I can do this. I do.
 Too bad I don't have my magic anymore. If I did, none of this would be happening. And I could've saved Enzo. 
 Thanks.
 You just killed your whole family?
 You're gonna be human. Enzo!
 There's nothing you can say.
 That's a shame. A good human skill's knowing when to shut up.
 You killed Enzo, Stefan. You killed Enzo.
 Ok. Safe travels. 
 I didn't know you were here.
 He's earned it. I hate him.
 Right now? Yes. Perfectly.
 Do you really have to ask?
 Your point?
 I just need time.
 Something's happening, something wrong. No.
 I had these visions, fire, Elena's coffin. You're not the only one I have a psychic connection to. I think Elena's in trouble.
 I don't know. But I know I have to go.
 We're okay. Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.
 But I don't have any magic.
 The one who wants revenge for what we did to her.
 Maybe there's a way to destroy the dimension itself. Destroying hell destroys her.
 Elena. Elena!
 Hi! 
 I'm okay. I can be with Enzo now.
 Elena. I'm ready.
 Enzo.
 I saw her. I saw Elena.
 We're too far away. Can't get back in time to help.
 What do you mean? You know Damon won't leave her here to die alone.
 You okay?
 It's okay, Ric. I understand.
 He knows you do.
 Look, if there was something we could do, we would do it. 
 Like the kind of energy contained in hellfire?
 Listen, Stefan, I know I've been hard on you, but I also know that you and I are equally willing to do anything we can to fix this.
 I think I do. But the only way it gets rid of Katherine Pierce is if she's in hell when I destroy it. That's where it gets tricky.
 I need to thank you for what you did earlier tonight in the fire.
 Yeah, you did. And not just that, you made me realize that I had all the magic I ever needed right inside me. 
 I'm gonna save the world. And you need to get in that car and drive away.
 Ric will fill you in. I love you.
 I'll be fine. Promise.
 Okay, Grams. If I ever needed you to hear me, hear me now.
 Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moventur, ego ex vos, vos ex unos...
 Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moventur, ego ex vos, vos ex unos...
 ... phasmatos incendia moventur, ego ex vos, vos ex unos, phasmatos incendia entrare! Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moventur, ego ex vos, vos ex unos, phasmatos incendia entrare!
 Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moventur, ego ex vos, vos ex unos, phasmatos incendia entrare!!!
 No. I can do this. I can do this. I can beat you. You can't have me. It's not my time.
 
 It's too strong. I can't do it alone.
 Grams.
 Phasmatos incendia movet, phasmatos incendia moveo...
 I did it.
 Here she is.
 I did it. I broke the spell.
 It took some time, but I think I've finally figured this witch thing out.
 He's with Caroline. Saying goodbye.
 I'm determined to keep my promise to Enzo. I'm gonna live this life to the fullest. I wanna see the world. Enjoy my life. Do I have everything?
