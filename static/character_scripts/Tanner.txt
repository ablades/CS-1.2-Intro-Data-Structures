 Once our home state of Virginia joined confederacy in 1861, it created a tremendous amount of tension within the state. People in Virginia's northwest region had different ideals than those from the traditional deep south. Then Virginia divided in 1863 with the northwest region joining the union. (continues talking)
 The Battle of Willow Creek took place right at the end of the war in our very own Mystic Falls. How many casualties resulted in this battle? Ms. Bennett?
 Cute becomes dumb in an instant, Ms. Bennett. Mr. Donovan? Would you like to take this opportunity to overcome your embedded jock stereotype?
 Hmm. Elena? Surely you can enlighten us about one of the town's most significantly historical events?
 I was willing to be lenient last year for obvious reasons, Elena. But the personal excuses ended with summer break.
 That's correct. Mister...?
 Salvatore. Any relation to the original settlers here at Mystic Falls?
 Well, very good. Except, of course, there were no civilian casualties in this battle.
 Hmm.
 Originally discovered nearly 5 centuries ago, it hasn't been over Mystic Falls in over 145 years. Now, the comet will be its brightest right after dusk during tomorrow's celebration. Are we bothering you, Mr. Salvatore? Ms. Gilbert?
 As Jeremy's teacher, I'm concerned. All right? It's the third day of school and he's skipped six of his classes.
 Four months ago, a great loss. Car accident. Wickery bridge, if I remember correctly. And you're related to the family how? The, uh, mother's kid sister?
 Right.
 Not when you're on drugs. It's his attempt at coping, Ms. Summers. And the signs are there. He's moody, withdrawn, argumentative, hungover. Are there any other relatives in the picture?
 Uh-huh. Could there be?
 It's an impossible job, isn't it, raising two teens?
 Wrong answer. It is an extremely impossible job, and anything less and you're not doing it properly.
 World war II ended in...Anyone got anything? Miss Juan? 1945.
 Pearl Harbor.
 Miss Gilbert?
 Pearl Harbor?
 Thank you, Miss Gilbert.
 Very well. The fall of the Berlin wall.
 Are you? How good? Keep it to the year. Civil Rights Act.
 John F. Kennedy assassination.
 Martin Luther King.
 Lincoln.
 Roe vs. Wade.
 Brown vs. Board.
 The battle of Gettysburg.
 Korean war.
 Ha! It ended in '52.
 Look it up, somebody. Quickly.
 Mr. Lockwood, is there anything you're good at? 'Cause it isn't history, and it sure as hell isn't defending the ball!
 Now do it again!
 Varsity trials were last spring, Mr. Salvatore.
 And you're not here now, as far as I'm concerned.
 Well, I won't be asking you who won the super bowl in '71.
 Just to see you get knocked on your ass. Borrow some gear. Go! Before I change my mind. Let's run it again!
 Get it.
 Do it again.
 You gonna live, Salvatore?
 Walk it off, son.
 All right.
 Wait, wait, wait, Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Let's be honest here. In the past, we used to let other teams come into our town and roll right over us! We've got some great new talent tonight starting on the offense, and I'm gonna tell you right now, it has been a long time since I have seen a kid like this with hands like these. Let's give it up for Stefan Salvatore!
 That have been waiting for us to put a check in the win column, I have only one thing to say to you...Your Timberwolves are hungry.
 And the central high lions are what's for dinner!
 Salvatore! What the hell? We've got a game to play!
 Aah!
