 For now.
 She's fine. Aren't you Miss Gibbons?
 Where are you going?
 So, I'm the baby sitter now?
 So you saying...
 I hate this house.
 I didn't stay locked up for a hundred and forty five years to end up locked here.
 You're going to stop me?
 I don't care what Pearl said. What you got boy?
 Try that again.
 And I'm tired of your rules. I want out of this house. Why can't we go out on the town?
 No one knows who I am.
 And I wish to hell that I could run into them. There are the reason we were caught in the first place.
 Bethanne and I are going out for a bit. Hit the town, kick up our heels.
 You're going to stop me? I didn't think so.
 Katherine?
 My mistake.
 Need some help?
 Pick up your other foot.
 Here you go.
 Was that Damon Salvatore you were with?
 We go way back. He still live out by Miller Lane?
 I prefer to stay here and talk to you.
 I'm pretty sure you'd like it.
 That is a nice scent you wear. What is it?
 Vervain...making it hard to find something to eat in this town.
 She won't be coming back.
 Well, you were right.We shouldn't have left.
 We're running low on blood. You might wanna send Anna to the hospital for some more.
 Maybe I could go with her. If the storm keeps it dark enough, I might be able to go out during the day, no sun and all.
 He and his brother deserved it.
 I understand, Miss Pearl. I just wish I knew what you were up to.
 We should kill every last one of them.
 You heard her. No revenge. Patience. Self-control. She seems to have it all figured out, doesn't she?
 Pearl's not home. Hmm. Beautiful weather. Not a ray of sun in the sky.
 Billy.
 Whoa. I'm sorry. You haven't been invited in. Miss Gibbons?
 Never let this bad man in.
 145 years left starving in a tomb, thanks to Katherine's infatuation with you and your brother. First few weeks, every single nerve in your body screams with fire. The kind of pain that can drive a person mad. Well...I thought your brother might want to get a taste of that before I killed him. Billy.
 You have a nice day.
 Vervain on the ropes.
 That's gotta sting. Speaking of...
 He killed Beth-Anne. One of us, Harper. And don't you think for a second he wouldn't kill you if he had the chance. Pearl says we're not here for revenge, right? I say that's exactly what we're here for. Starting with this.
 And then his brother. And anyone else that gets in our way.
 You're gonna want to let go of me!
 Miss Pearl is no longer in charge. Tie him up! And then stake him down.
 Well, lucky you.
 Not in the slightest.
 Billy, show our visitor where the phone is in the kitchen. And get me something to drink.
 Billy, what's the holdup?!
 Billy, Jacob, get back in here!
 Spread out. Now. You two, back of the house. Go. Check out both rooms. Cellar, now.
 Aah!
 This is for Beth-Anne.
 And this is for the tomb.
 Ugh! Unh!
 No problem, buddy.
 Well, well.
 If it isn't Pearl's daughter. Little Annabelle.
 Still hanging around the Gilbert kid, huh? I guess you forgot the fact that his family killed you and your mother.
 Ask your ancestors.
 Well, it's a Founders' celebration. And we've...
 We got some unfinished business with the Founding Families.
