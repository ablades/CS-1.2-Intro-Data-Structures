 Excuse me! Do you guys know which way is the office?
 Yeah, I am. It's kind of hard to hide it. My name's Luka.
 Hi, Bonnie.
 Thanks man. It's nice to meet you Bonnie.
 Hey Bonnie.
 It was great. I would like to introduce you to my dad.
 Oh yes, please have a seat.
 I'll say.
 It's looking up.
 I will see you at school.
 Alright, I got a winner guys. I got a winner.
 Um, I'll see him back home.
 Hey Bonnie. I'm sorry about earlier, my dad is not very subtle with the whole Bennett/Salem question. He picked up on you, he was just fishing around, he didn't mean any harm.
 I know. That's why we're having this conversation right now. He uh...doesn't like for anyone to know.
 But we were both worry that you would bail us.
 He just wants us to fit in here for once. It's tough Bonnie, being different.
 Well, we prefer the term warlock.
 So your Grams waited until you were in high school to tell you that you're a witch?
 So, then, you're like, new?
 Like?
 Your nose bleeds?
 It's 'cause you're trying to do too much on your own. You need help.
 From nature. The elements. Just things that you can draw extra power from. Have you ever channeled another witch before?
 Say we put our energy together. We can double our strength. I'll show you, watch. Let me see that bracelet.
 Take this. Now, I want you to stand very still and concentrate.
 Okay. I know...
 We're channeling. The personal items will act as a talisman. Now concentrate.
 
 It's global warming, man. I don't know. I got to go. See you later, Bonnie.
 Bye.
 Riveting.
 Nothing.
 It's Bonnie Bennett. She's channeling me.
 You told me to bond with her, so I bonded.
 I don't know what makes me more upset  that I showed you how to channel, or that you almost killed me.
 I forgive you.
 They're all grimoires.
 Witches from all over the world have collected their spells in grimoires, but over the centuries, most of them have gotten lost and my dad is obsessed with finding them, and making sure that our family's heritage stays intact.
 Well the way he sees it, all witches are family. We're all bound together by a code of loyalty to help each other.
 That's one reason. (smiles.)
 That depends, because spells are unique and very specific; but I'm sure that we can figure it out.
 You know, this is good. This is really good. There's a clear view of the moon and it's private.
 Are we? So what is this mysterious talisman we're unbinding?
 Oh, wow, a white rock. This is fascinating.
 What's it spelled with?
 Really? Help a girl out, she still keeps secrets.
 I'm just teasing you.
 Of course I was. She fell for the whole...show and didn't suspect a thing.
 Yeah, whatever. I'm going to sleep.
 So you're talking to me now.
 Well, had I had known that's all it took...
 What do you say? You want to play a game?
 Yeah?
 What's happening to me?
 Please stop. Please.
 Klaus. We both want him dead.
 Because he has her and we have to get her away from him.
 My sister.
 He's searching for a way to undo the curse without the doppelg√§nger. He's forced generations of witches to help him for centuries.
 If we help Elijah kill Klaus, he's promised to return her to us.
 He'll kill me if I tell you. Don't make me.
 After the sacrifice, Klaus will be vulnerable, weak. It's our only chance.
 Klaus will be vulnerable.
 Yes. Elena has to die.
 You want to tell me what the hell happened yesterday?
 Don't play dumb. You both were here and...
 And that's all I remember. One minute I'm playing pool and the next I'm waking up in a bathroom stall.
 See, I think you're lying.
 Bonnie said that you have information about Elijah.
 How?
 But what if they can find the burial ground?
 We don't have a back-up plan, though, dad, and we need to be doing everything we can to save Greta.
 You're going to kill them?
 No. I'm not strong enough to send you. I can do this.
 Dad. I want this just as much as you.
 I got it.
 I'm in the Salvatore house. Elijah's body must be here.
 Elena and Damon. They're reading.
 Elena's fighting me.
 She's stronger than me.
 What?
