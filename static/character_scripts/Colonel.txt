 Lieutenant Salvatore.
 You and every man out here, Salvatore. No. Request denied.
 Anything?
 All right, then. I've got a mission. Honestly, it's more of a chore.
 There's a farmhouse twelve miles to the east. Rumor is there are Union sympathizers there hiding Confederate deserters. Now, if these rumors are true, I need those deserters arrested and brought back to me.
 You and every other man out here, Salvatore. No.
 Well, now that you mention it, there's a farmhouse about twelve miles east of here. Rumor is there are Union sympathizers there.
 Yes. Yes, Lieutenant.
 And, if you bring the deserters back to me, then you shall have your leave, Salvatore.
