 Perhaps we could talk outside.
 How long do you plan on staying with the Salvatores? People talk, Katherine. You, carrying on with both brothers, doesn't help the situation.
 A match you lit, no doubt.
 Honey, please be careful!
 Honoria Fell came by the apothecary yesterday with a case of this elixir. 
 Try it.
 Vervain.
 They're trying to find us, and they're getting crafty about it.
 It might be time for us to move on again.
 Have you thought any more of what I've said?
 You're going to turn both of them, aren't you?
 Katherine, please. Be careful.
 Yes, Mr. Gilbert. I'm still waiting for you to explain that comet in the sky.
 The sheriff was here earlier. He bought large volumes of the vervain elixir.
 Doesn't he always?
 I'm beyond saving. We know that.
 
 Thank you, Annabelle.
 Get Emily. Stay hidden. I'll get us out of here.
 Johnathan!
 Johnathan...please.
 I beg you!
 Anna.
 Annabelle.
 The guard. The one at the church. The one who locked us in. She promised to turn him. He was obsessed with her. She had him under her spell, like everybody else. He let her go.
 I'm glad you found us. Ms. Gibbons, this gentleman is a friend of mine.
 May he come in?
 Annabelle, close the door, please.
 The keypad is for texting which is what you do when you want to avoid talking to someone.
 I was just showing Harper what you taught me. What a marvelous device!
 Of course not.
 What do you think?
 That's the goal. I can't say that I miss corsets.
 What's that?
 We have some business in town. We'll be back as soon as we can. I trust that you'll keep an eye on things.
 Frederick, if this is going to work we have to cooperate with one another.
 Thank you Harper.
 Hello Damon.
 An invitation wasn't necessary. I'm surprised that no living person resides here. Is it just you and your brother?
 Have a seat, Damon. I was hoping we could have a word.
 We've taken up residence at a farmhouse just outside the town. It'll suffice for now.
 Not all, some. I imagine that a few have already left town. Others are probably still in the woods or like us acclimating.
 I understand from Anna that the founding families still have a secret council?
 And so am I. And now that you've infiltrated the council, I'll need to know everything they know. Starting with a listing names of all the council members and their families.
 Yes, that will have to stop immediately.
 Mystic Falls is our home, Damon. They took that from us. Our land, our home. It's time we rebuild.
 As a reward for your help I'm willing to give you what you want most.
 Katherine.
 Katherine and I were best friends long before we came to Mystic Falls, Damon. I know how she thinks, I know her patterns, I know where to find her.
 I'm not asking for your help, Damon. Finding Katherine was just a mere gesture of kindness. The rest is non-negotiable.
 I have four hundred years on you, little boy. I'll rip you from limb to limb without even blinking and you know it. I'll be in touch.
 Miss Sommers?
 Hi. This is my Daughter, Annabelle.
 An apothecary?
 You don't say.
 I'll use my imagination.
 Annabelle?
 Back off. Back off! We don't fight each other. Those are the rules.
 Eventually. But for now we have to keep a low profile.
 The Salvatore's brothers do.
 Where have you been?
 For three hours? Tell me, where have you been?
 Annabelle, don't do this. I can't fight you too. What?
 So, where's Bethanne?
 What happened? Where is she?
 No. Hungry?
 Next time you'll listen to me.
 I'll send her out for some tomorrow.
 I'm afraid not. Not after your stunt at the Salvatore house tonight.
 And where did that get you? Your girlfriend Bethanne is dead. And you have no one to blame but yourself. We cannot live our lives about revenge. We have to have better control of our emotions.
 I'm going to make an exploratory visit into town tomorrow to assess who's under the influence of vervain and who isn't. Anna tells me that the players haven't changed much. It's still the Lockwoods, the Forbes, the Fells...
 We are smarter than that, Frederick. These people are not our enemies. We don't hold grudges and resentments. We'll get our town back. We just have to have patience.
 Did you get everything?
 Who's that you were talking to?
 Let's get home.
 We'll make do.
 Mayor...Lockwood, is it? I suppose it is treacherous outside. My name is Pearl.
 This is my daughter Anna. We've just recently moved to town.
 It would be a pleasure.
 I'm in the process of obtaining some property. I understand that your family is the largest property owner in town.
 Your family came into a lot of new property in 1864.
 It's a passion of mine.
 I'm sorry, Mayor. Do you know that boy over there?
 You don't say.
 Jeremy Gilbert? Is that what you've been up to?
 His family is the reason I was stuck in a tomb for over a century.
 I want you to stop seeing him.
 Then stop acting like a child! As soon as Jeremy finds out what you really are, he will turn on you.
 What did you just say?
 Stop. What's going on here? What did you do?
 Trust me. The parties responsible for this will be dealt with.
 This wasn't supposed to happen.
 Annabelle tells me you're looking for something I took from Jonathan Gilbert.
 Jonathan was passionate about his inventions. He confided in me that he had created a detection device meant to track down the town's vampire element.
 That's what it turned out to be yes. But that's not what I stole. I discovered my mistake when I saw the watch in Jonathan's hand, the night they took us, its stile pointed at me.
 I have no idea but now it's yours.
 There is no catch. My daughter wants to stay here. I want to stay here. You refused to trust us and for good reason. Consider this an apology.
 Hello, Mr. Gilbert.
 Jenna tells me that you wanted to discuss the sale of the building in person.
 I'm not stupid, Mr. Gilbert. You knew who I was when you requested the meeting. So, Damon tells me that you're looking for the device I took from Johnathan. I'm sure you realize I have no intention of giving it to you.
 Really? How so?
 No apologies necessary. So, tell me, Mr. Gilbert, why should I let you have the device?
 But the device doesn't work. Why would you even want it?
 Johnathan was ahead of his time.
 You're lying.
 I gave it to Damon.
 I gave your device to Damon. Why don't you ask him for it yourself? I'm sure he'd be delighted to give it to you. And then, Mr. Gilbert, may you rot in hell.
 I need you to pack your things. We're leaving.
 I was wrong to think that we could make a home here. It's time for us to move on.
 We can't stay. There's too many people here who know the truth...Too much history.
 It's not safe here. You know that.
 Is this is about Jeremy?
 You gave me my life back. I am just trying to protect yours. I can't force you. It's your decision.
 Thank you, Harper.
 Annabelle should be back in a minute. You know, you don't have to come with us if you don't want to.
 Let me help you with these.
