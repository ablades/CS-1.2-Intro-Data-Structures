 You promised.
 Don't give me that. I know the game. You tear them up enough, they always suspect an animal attack. You said you had it under control.
 Please, Uncle Stefan. Mystic Falls is a different place now. It's been quiet for years, but there are people who still remember. And you being here, it's just going to stir things up.
 Then what is? Why did you come back? After all this time, why now?
 I know that you can't change what you are. But you don't belong here anymore.
 I can't tell you what to do. But coming back here was a mistake.
 What's going on?
 What is Damon doing here? Why did he come home?
 Well, he's putting us all at risk. This girl in the hospital could talk.
 You're sure?
 So what happens if it doesn't work?
 Is she worth it? Uncle Stefan, this girl you came back for?
 I didn't know you were here.
 Why are you here, Damon?
 I know you. You always have a motive. So tell me, what is it this time?
 I didn't mean to upset you.
 No, I'm not. And neither are you. How many more people have to die before you see that?
 Then why aren't you doing anything about it?
 The vervain could weaken him if he ingested it. It would help get you the upper hand.
 It's just something that's been passed down through the generations. Blood only runs so deep when you're related to vampires. Damon would kill me if he knew that I had it.
 Because I trust you. And you're gonna need it if you want to get rid of him.
 That was his favorite scotch. I'm sorry, I thought it would work.
 You knew it would fail?
 I doubled what I put in the scotch.
 You're going to school?
 Why haven't you called her?
 What choice do you have? You came here because you wanted to live as normal a life as you could. You knew this was going to be a part of it.
 I'm full of vervain. I've been putting it in my coffee for 16 years. My blood will only make you worse. Damon?
 We're not family, Damon. Only in the most dysfunctional sense. In fact, I avoided having a living, breathing, loving family because of you.
 You know I can't do that.
 But you don't visit, Damon. You appear, unannounced, reminding me that this isn't my house; that you're just permitting me to live here. Hell, that you're permitting me to live.
 I came to say good-bye, Damon.
 No! No! Get out of here. Run! Run!
 You must be Damon.
 Come on in, Damon.
 Oh, uh, one of the boarders is craving blueberry pancakes.
 Thanks, Stefan.
 No. Why?
 Damon, please don't hurt her.
