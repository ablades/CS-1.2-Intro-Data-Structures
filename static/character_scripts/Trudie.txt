 Yes?
 Well, I haven't heard that name in years. How do you know her?
 My god. You're her daughter. 
 Uh, the kitchen's this way.
 It's no problem. Um, just a surprise, though.
 I haven't thought about Isobel in years.
 About 17 years ago, when she left to go have you. We kept in touch for a while, but, well, you know, people drift apart.
 She was in Florida for a while. She was on her own. I know it wasn't easy.
 I could never get her to fess up. Anyway, she finally pulled it together, got into college on a scholarship.
 Somewhere in North Carolina. Duke, I think.Smart girl, smart school.
 Let me just grab that.
 Ah. They came to the games for us.The football team hadn't won in years. We were the stars. Well, Izzie was. But I was a damn good backup.
 You're welcome. 
 Oh, it's just some herbal mixture.
 Know what?
 I think that you should probably leave.
 Please leave. Now!
 May I help you?
 You're welcome. I didn't tell her anything. I I kept my promise.
 The girl, though, sheâ€”she knew something.
 Good. So I'm done?
 No, I won't invite you in! You can't come in!
 I don't understand. I did what you told me. I did my part!
