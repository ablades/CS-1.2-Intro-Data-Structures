 My name is Tom. You're going to be alright.
  Pneumothorax. I need a 10-gauge needle now.
 If you don't do it now, she's not going to make it to the operating table.
 Hi
 The one and only. What can I do for you? Ms, uh.. ?
 I was just doing my job.
 How's seven o'clock?
 What's happening? Who are you people?
 Of course.
 What's going on?
 Hazel seemed nice, so you know, I figured, uh, why not have dinner? So I showered, picked her up and that was it   that was the last thing I remember for four months.
 Like you said, she was a real witch.
  I don't know why I'm telling you my whole life's story.
 Hmm. Why do you want to know so much about me?
 And?
 Well, likewise, because I do remember you saving my life. So, if there's anything I can do to repay you, let me know.
 I don't understand.
 Well, he's one hell of a lucky guy.
 I don't think I've ever eaten so much in my life.
