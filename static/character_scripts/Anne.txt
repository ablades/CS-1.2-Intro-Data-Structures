 Third time in here this week.
 You know, ladies in the 9th ward say my sister, Sophie, bleeds a piece of her soul into every dish.
 And?
 Because, Hayley, people like you were run out of here years ago.
 In the bayou, they call the werewolves "Roux-Ga-Roux". 
 That's the beauty of you  you're never wrong. She's the only way we're gonna get to Klaus.
 Who? Half the witches don't believe you, the other half are too scared.
 We don't have any other options, Sophie.
 Now go. You know what you need to do.
 I didn't do anything.
 Rot in hell, monster.
