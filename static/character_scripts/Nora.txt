 What a saint you are, Malcolm.
 This is ludicrous.
 So, you're allowed to explore the world while we're stuck here, starving ourselves, pretending like we're not the strongest people on the planet?
 What about Oscar? He's been gone days running your errands. I highly doubt he's off living in secret.
 Oh, dear! Is their automobile okay?
 Valerie, don't cry. Okay? You're home now. You're with us.
 
 Lily needs to learn that Heretics aren't designed to coexist.
 Well, if you were pretty, you'd be, too.
 We're not interested.
 
 
 I do love that jacket.
 Don't you just love what she's wearing?
 "Care" isn't leaving yet.
 
 
 
 
 Mar... It's the 21st century. We can hold hands now.
 Hello, neighbor.
 It's Malcolm!
 
 I don't, but if these two could, I'm sure it's idiot-proof.
 I'm wearing your jacket! Though, it's a little large on me...
 I feel silly.
 Nobody wears this anymore!
 
 Chop, chop. Let's go. Lily's waiting.
 
 Hmm. Thank you.
 My family wanted me dead. Malcolm made sure they didn't succeed.
 Don't get cocky. You're still spelled into the room, but I figured you could use some space to stretch your legs, and maybe give this a read.
 I know you think Valerie was doing you a favor, that she's the nice one. And trust me, she's the worst of all of us.
 It's Stefan's. She never goes anywhere without it.
 It's the first thing she looked for when we realized we were trapped in 1903. The entry for July 15, 1863 should tell you why.
 God, it feels good to come out of that deserted town and be around living, breathing humans we can eat! Mystic Falls is the prison world all over again.
 
 
 I'm getting hungry. Is it death-o'clock yet?
 What's this?
 As if you'd even know how to do that. We're going!
 
 Not happening, Stefan. Look, if I siphon Caroline's spell, Valerie will find out, and she'll retaliate with something much worse. The girl is a rancid bitch.
 
 Hmmm. Not bad!
 No, you look nice! It's just... kind of plain. But, I can sex it up for you.
 
 
 A gin martini and a "Sex on the Beach."
 Thanks! It's culled together with stuff I found on Pinterest.
 Obsessed!
 Have a taste! She's been sneaking tequila, so she's a little spicy. Heh.
 What the hell?
 
 
 
 Mar?
 Mary Lou? You can't avoid me for 
 
 Get away from her!
 
 Of course it matters! They were going to hurt you! I'm going to find them, and rip their heads off, and smash them together like two disgusting melons, and...
 Why are you smiling?
 I'm sorry. You were right to worry.
 We should get back to Mystic Falls.
 He's still sitting there?
 Oscar? Darling, it's Nora. Do you... Do you remember me?
 So fun!
 Right. Well, he's clearly unwell. We can't just leave him here.
 What's Lily going to say?
 So, you just line up those matching pieces of candy like so.
 There you go! You got it. It took Mary Louise a month to pass the first level.
 Oh, yeah! Give it another five minutes, you'll be full-on addicted.
 
 
 You would do that?
 You're greeting them dressed like that?
 Deputy Donovan. Welcome.
 Okay, look  the whole point of this shindig is to start over. So...
 
 Apparently, Matt is sick of us.
 Look around. Look at all these people. They're still alive, aren't they?
 
 Come on, let's go meet people.
 Mare, did you change? You're looking very Scarlet Johanss 
 Me? Haha! You're the one who wanted the chocolate chips to melt.
 Hahaha!
 It's our anniversary. Mary Lou and I have been together for 133 years.
 
 
 This is epic!
 Heh. But there's so many!
 See? I told you she was incapable of fun. Come on. Let's go before she ruins our entire night.
 This is what I read to everyone in that horrible prison world...
 Thank you, Lily. This is so special, I love it.
 
 Mare, this is gorgeous! Did you do all this?
 A gift for us.
 "But could youth last and love still breed, have joys no date, nor age no need..."
 Yes.
 Yes. Of course, yes!
 Hold on. Where's Julian? We should wait for him.
 
 
 Mare. You heard what she said. What are you waiting for?
 That's why we stick together. We're family.
 For what?
 Mare, hey. Where are you going? We still need to unlink Lily.
 Mare, stop. You've been crying. What happened?
 How could you do that to Lily?
 This is different.
 He took her child from her! And you would side with him?
 This doesn't represent our love  it represents Julian's ability to manipulate us. I don't want it.
 I don't want any of it.
 LILY!
 The splinters must be inside your heart. I can't... I can't get them out.
 What do I do? Tell me what to do!
 We wouldn't be a family without you, Lily. I love you. I am so sorry this happened...
 Goodbye.
 
 I haven't heard from either of them in days. I sided with Lily, or did you forget?
 
 When I was a girl, I loved my mother deeply. She loved me, too, until she found out about my little siphoning problem. If she only knew that was just one of the things that made me different. When she turned her back on me, I thought I'd never find that kind of love again. You proved me wrong. Thank you, Lily.
 You appear tired.
 Uh, I have a toy... for a tot.
 I didn't, actually. It was a passive aggressive gift for when Mary Louse came crawling back to me, but that hasn't happened, so...
 I know.
 But how will the tot know the toy's from me?
 I want to be more involved. See, I recently enrolled in classes, and...
 Because I was curious about college and, well... Mary Louise hated the idea, so...
 Look, you clearly need help.
 Are you going to let that old news get in the way of a little charity? And I'm not evil.
 
 
 I can deal with difficult people.
 Let me guess  hot cocoa and vervain?
 
 What do you need from me?
 I wasn't born yesterday. It's all right. I want to do some charity. I might as well start.
 
 
 What? Surprised I'm not massacring the leukemia patients?
 
 This looks like her...
 What?
 
 
 Am I going to apologize? For what?
 Oh, you mean the ring that Julian gave you?
 He's the reason Lily is dead!
 You still believe him? He's a liar! Why can't you see that?
 So am I. I'm done, Mary Lou. Okay? It's... it's over.
 
 
 Yeah, but you're too scared to go out into the world. Too scared to change.
 And when was the last time you even did any charity?
 Hmm?
 She called me a charity case.
 Oh, it's all right. I used one of your hideous tops.
 
 She's loving, protective, kind...
 
 Maybe... Maybe you don't.
 
 Thank you for today. You're a very kind person, and... beautiful. Even if you do wear hideous tops.
 I guess I was wrong.
 You and your friends are not kind at all.
 Even if he can, he'll be different... Just like you.
 
 
 Ah. Infants drinking. What a lovely image. Can't say I'm surprised.
 And I'm quite good at gifts  don't forget that.
 Perhaps it's time for me to leave...
 I would, but I'm afraid your friend here may say something inappropriate to me, and then find himself never able to speak again.
 Oh, I didn't, actually. That would have looked like this.
 Take another step toward me, and I'll pluck your vocal cords from your throat and use them to play a rather sporting game of "Pin the tail on the Deputy."
 The party was lovely. Thank you.
 Oh, spare me the lecture.
 After I left your wretched party, I found this in my mail.
 
 
 It's a warning... From the Huntress.
 You certainly know her weapon.
 Yes. Custom-made for her. She used it to put Julian in the stone, along with thousands of other vampires. She's ruthless. Once you've been marked by her sword, she never stops hunting you. That's how Beau got his scar. She'll come to him now. She'll come for all of us.
 There's no stopping her  ever. And there's no "we" involved. Besides, she's not after you, so it's really not your concern.
 Then what do you propose we do?
 
 
 What are you doing here?
 
 I trust her. She actually cares about the well-being of others. Unlike you, who only cares about pleasing Julian.
 
 She was spelled to be a vampire huntress by shamans. They created that sword for her and imbued her with extraordinary strength. Why shouldn't they give her a very long life to go with it?
 Hey, do you remember that reading from class last week? You know, the one about those fragments of Native American myths? Uh, the Everlastings?
 We authorized personnel here to see a patient by the name of Rayna Cruz. Tell us where to find her.
 
 And we don't look familiar to you?
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
 Bonnie's right.
 We'll keep looking. She's probably here under another name.
 
 The point of what?
 Are you all right?
 I had no idea, I swear.
 I thought you'd be back in Mystic Falls by now.
 Well, Rayna's dead. Julian's safe. You'll surely sleep easy tonight.
 Bonnie?
 And what if I did? She's beautiful, smart, and loyal... And you appear to be only two of those things.
 We do... still make a good team.
 Beau!
 Oh, my God.
 He's not healing.
 Let's go, come on.
 Oh, my God, Beau.
 
 Beau's scar opened up, which means she's coming for him. And she'll never stop coming for him. Once she kills him, she'll go after every other vampire in her path.
 
 We're all in danger, Bonnie. Beau's scar is the mark from her Sword, and it will lead Rayna Cruz straight to him. Once you've been marked, she'll chase you to the ends of the earth until your soul is back in that stone. Once she gets Beau, she'll go after any other vampire in her path, and right now this hospital's full of them.
 Beau, don't despair. We'll get you away from here. Far away.
 You can't stay here. Come with us.
 They could drain you, Val. You could die.
 We'll keep moving. Just like we did before.
 I'm not journeying all the way across the ocean in a pine box!
 She's here.
 No!
 Hyah!
 No!
 Once a vampire's been marked, she'll chase you to the ends of the earth.
 I thought you hated rubbish food?
 
 Us, Mary Lou. Starting over. Together. Away from all this. New horizons, new everything.
 Here.
 It's a ring made from candy.
 But what it is is good enough. We're all we have left. Let's see what else is out there together.
 
 
 I'll do anything. Just... name your price.
 
 Not that I'm not grateful for the chance to get some air, but what exactly am I doing?
 
 Are you all right?
 Who could blame you in this horrid, damp basement? Every day, I dream I'll carry you away from this place, leaving a trail of gutted corpses in our wake.
 What happened?
 
 
 Get off me!
 
 Your toy got away.
 Well, lucky for you, I'm weak with hunger. Haven't had a proper meal in three bloody years.
 NO! NO!
 I'm attached to being alive! Those pills are what poisoned Mary Lou!
 I was promised an antidote in return for your capture.
 Alex. She said you released Rayna.
 My only motivation is Mary Louise! She's all I have in this world, and I will not let her die!
 
 I don't want one!
 Why should I trust you?
 "Hostage exchange?"
 Oh, don't be absurd! She wants me to bring you back to the Armory.
 
 Why are you helping me?
 Nobody important.
 
 As requested.
 Where's Mary Louise?
 I hope you remember how to drive.
 
 I'll tear your throat out!
 Mary Lou? Mary Lou, it's me.
 How are you feeling?
 
 Well, I don't care what she says. We'll find a way  together.
 
 Right. No more gloomy talk now. First thing we'll do is get you a decent meal. Something plump and juicy from the suburbs.
 To my eyes, you are perfect.
 
 No time for gloomy talk. I've been marked by Rayna Cruz, and I'll be running from her for as long as I live.
 No! What are you doing?
 
 If you don't stop, you will die!
 
 "Come live with me..."
 "...And be my love..."
 "And we will all the pleasures prove, that Valleys, groves..."
 "...Hills and fields, Woods or steepy mountains yield..."
 "...And we will sit upon the Rocks..."
 "...Seeing the Shepherds feed their flocks..."
 "And I will make the beds of Roses..."
 I love you.
