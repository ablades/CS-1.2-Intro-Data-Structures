 I can handle myself. Besides Klaus asked me personally.
 Stay out of this, Hayley. I'm going.
 Klaus gave me a direct order.
 You're not a hybrid, you don't know what it's like. Klaus asks for something, you do it.

 Dan Zimmer said you put a ding on the hood of his Shelby.
 That's funny. Sounds like you're calling my best customer a liar.

 That's what I thought.
 It looks like I need a new mechanic.

 How the hell are you so strong!?
