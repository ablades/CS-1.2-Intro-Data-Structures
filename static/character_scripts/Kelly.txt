 Oh, god.
 Not on my couch.
 Ah, you know, here and there. Never one place too long. You know Pete.
 So blonde's the new flavor of the month, huh? So sorry I scared her off.
 So she's the one?
 Mattie, seriously, Lezzie Forbes' daughter? Eck.
 Ice, please?
 No, but don't worry. She'll come home eventually when she needs something. I played that game.
 No.
 Are you trying to say I need a reason to come back? Sit down. Eat with me.
 Tell me everything I've missed, hmm.
 Elena, honey.
 Long time, no see.
 Oh, same old. Oh. Matty tells me you broke his heart.
 Just kidding. Calm down. He found his rebound girl.
 Oh. Here you go, sweetheart. However many that'll buy.
 I just hope I don't get Bachelor 3. I dated him in high school. Not impressive. 
 Very exciting.
 That's me.
 Okay, just stop. Stop trying so hard. This thing you're doing, this nice thing, it's fake. Like you. Like your mom. And for some reason, Matt fell for it, but that doesn't mean that I will. I don't like you, okay? So tell plumber boy I'll be at the bar.
 Wait. Why—why are we back here? I wasn't ready to leave.
 You're the best, Matty.
 I'm I'm sorry...I was gone so long.
 It's Pete. He's gone, and it's all my fault. I did it. I always do it.
 You're all I have left. 
 What? I'm trying to sleep.
 I'm sorry sweetie. It was a late night. My head is throbbing.
 It wasn't a party, it was one guy, don't be so judgy.
 I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I worked there.
 I'll check it out.
 Don't act so surprised.
 Well, there's back rent due.
 Like I said, I'll check it out.
 Who's that?
 What's with the glasses inside?
 You're new around here.
 I haven't been gone that long. I would remember someone who looked like you.
 Around, about.
 I love to see a man drown his sorrows. It's so sexy.
 I was supposed interviewing for the bartender job but I think the manager blew me off.
 Yeah. Last time I was in town I slept with her boyfriend.
 It happens.
 Jenna!
 And then I used to party with her.
 Not as crazy as you.
 Well sit, drink!
 Well, take a night off its good for the soul.
 Let's.
 Why? Where'd we go?
 Damn!
 Now that you've got me here. What are you gonna do with me?
 Oh my god, Matt! Oh my god.
 Matt...Matt....
 Matty, please...
 I know Matt.
 What's it look like?
 Well, sit down. You might wanna order pizza. I'm out of practice.
 Yeah. Some people aren't meant for the kitchen.
 Uh, I know it's been rough. But I'm gonna try. I mean, really try this time. You just have to bear with me, okay?
 Okay. Good.
 That bad, huh?
 It was nice of you to reach out to us.
 Well I guess dead kid rates a special greeting from the mayor, huh?
 I need a drink.
 Yeah...That's not gonna work. I already tried to bribe the guy with 20 bucks and a date. He said Carol Lockwood has complete control over the music choices.
 Thank God!
 Shh! We'll keep that between you and me. Where is the ladies' room?
 Vodka. Thank god!
 Oh god! I can't even walk.
 Oh my god, Matt is going to kill me.
 Yeah, I know I just should be on my best behavior because of Vicki but I don't want to think about it. I can't, because if I do...
 You're nice to talk to me. I don't have anyone to talk to.
 Matt?!
 No. I ruined it, I always ruin it. What is wrong with me?
 What are you doing?
 What are you doing? Matt don't.
 I'm not leaving you. Matty!
 No, tonight was...God, I'm so sorry. I know I failed you and I failed Vicki but I won't do it to you again. I promise I'll get it together.
 Hi, Matty.
 I saw you two talking, I couldn’t wait to see my son.
 As I remember, I asked you to call me back.
 That was a lifetime ago. Things have changed since then. I was, I was actually glad to hear from him.
 She's gonna burn down Mystic Falls with hellfire.
 Oh, then it's a good thing you weren't an only child.
 She was, Until my son opened up a portal to hell.
