 I need you to call these four guys back for another shift. I need the manpower.
 Hold on, I'll be right back.
 Sir? Sir? Who are you?
 
 Glad you're here, Donovan. We're lucky to have you.
 Well, Hammond is screwed any way you cut it. We got the forest surrounded. Boys just raided a cabin. Found traces of blood, but no Marty, which means that...
 And nobody can survive these temperatures overnight. We're just laying low. Gonna wait for nature to do our work for us.
 All right. Try to calm down and tell me what happened.
 Hey, you're safe now, ma'am.
 All right.
 All right, everyone. Matt Donovan's got this.
