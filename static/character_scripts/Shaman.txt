 Hear me, great spirit, hear me. We call upon you in this moment of need. We bring you an offering. A woman who desires justice for herself, for our tribe.
 Drink.
 She drinks the tea of protection so that she may be strong, and so that no magic may touch her.
 She accepts our singular lives, so that she may have many.
 No, they are not dead! They live on within you. Now... for the final step.
 She wields a weapon of judgment, one that thirsts for the blood of those that prey upon us. Link her spirit with this sword. This blade draws blood from a vampire. It will connect you. It will guide you. It will aide you in their destruction.
 Avenge your father. Avenge us all.
 Great Spirit, we call upon you in this moment of need.
 
 It is a great honor to meet you, Rayna.
 Hear me, Great Spirit. Hear me. We call upon you in this moment of need. One has come before you. For many lifetimes as your servant, your vengeance... let her journey end. Let another take her remaining years... Let another take up her burden.
