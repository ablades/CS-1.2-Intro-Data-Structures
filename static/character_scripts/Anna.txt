 Oh my god. I am so sorry. There was this one book wedged between the other, and so I pulled and then kaplunk, kaboom. 
 
 
 Nope. You want reference. This way. Um, home-schooled. I study here for a "mock-school environment." Ah, here we go. Original settlers, town archives, Founders' stuff. It's all here. So, what's your topic?
 You might want to focus that.
 
 Well, there's not a lot of documentation, but the stories have been told since the Civil War. My granddad used to tell me all these creepy stories when I was little. And he said that his granddad told them to him.
 Which are?
 That sounds like vampires to me.
 Man, you're smart. I gotta give it to you; when I first saw you, I missed it.
 Well, good luck on your paper. I gotta get home. 
 Yeah? Why?
 Nope. Gramps died. And all the kids split his stuff. I can ask.
 Maybe it's based in some partial reality.
 So, that's why you're hung up on the fiction of it all.
 Are those movies? Hey, I've never seen them. Maybe we can have a Fright Night and rent a whole bunch of vampire movies.
 Why does that sound like a "no way in hell"? Sorry, I'm blunt.
 Oh please, sure. No worries. I meant as friends. Yeah. Look, I really gotta go. Nice meeting you, Jeremy.
 There you are.
 Hi. Okay, look. I know I don't know you, so don't ask me why I did this. I just, sometimes...mostly all the time- I have this need to be right. So I googled and...
 Proof. Sort of.
 Well, I only went as far back as 1942, and found that there's been a string of animal attacks periodically in and around this town for the past seventy-five years. It's consistent. In '62, five bodies found. In '53, four people killed. In '74, three people dead. And there's been five this year. All attacked. All suffered major blood loss, as in drained of blood.
 Hey. How'd it go?
 The paper.
 Cool. So what'd he say about the vampires? Did he believe it?
 Uh, hey, um...D-do you wanna do something later, maybe?
 Oh. How'd you get stuck with that?
 Maybe, you know, tomorrow or something.
 I'm being pushy again, aren't I? Heh.
 You neglected to mention this was a theme party.
 Well, seeing as you also neglected to invite me, I took matters into my own hands.
 What thing would that be?
 
 Oh, I don't mind. It's fun. Oh, um, yeah. Before I forget, can I borrow your ancestor's journal?
 You said I could read it.
 Oh. Well, obviously you didn't bring it here, uh, but I can walk you home.
 Wait. Why did you give it to him?
 You know, you shouldn't be giving that to just anybody.
 Loan. Loan it to me.
 Maybe he's in his classroom. We can get it back.
 Um, there's something in it. Forget it. I...I gotta go.
 Trying to get the journal, as in sticking to the plan, something you're not doing. 
 She's not Katherine. Ok, Katherine is in the tomb.
 Don't be stupid. That girl is with the Salvatore brothers.
 Please, Noah. Don't do this. You're gonna ruin everything.
 You love it.
 His obsession got the best of him, and so did the Salvatore brothers.
 Tortured and staked.
 I warned him, Ben, and he was just gonna screw everything up anyway. Let's be honest, he wasn't exactly an asset. How'd you do?
 No, but I know where it is, and I'll get it.
 Can we go, Mama?
 Is something wrong?
 Hey, it's me again. Anna. Stalker chick and Foosball champion. I'll be at the Grill later, if you want, you know, a rematch, or whatever.
 Jeremy Gilbert.
 I need him for something. Get over it.
 Dude, you gotta stop doing that.
 You're new. You'll get it.
 Does that look like the Gilbert journal?
 I don't know, I figured maybe, just maybe, you've been paying a little bit of attention since we met.
 Here. Drink. I don't want you getting itchy around the witch. She can sense if you're weak.
 When we get that tomb open, you can kill anyone you want. For now, just stay focused on Bonnie while I try to get the journal back from Jeremy's teacher.
 I needed someone in a position to be my eyes and ears. Small town bartender fit the bill.
 You were sad, Ben. You lacked purpose. You needed me.
 Not yet. Just a lot of gibberish. Yeah, some people just shouldn't journal.
 Don't you have a date?
 You just couldn't live without me, huh?
 Oh, funny.
 Mrs. Fell is approaching.
 I was wondering how long it would take you to find me.
 I arrived around half-past comet, watching you screw up every chance you had to open that tomb.
 I didn't say much back then, which means I heard everything.
 I like to use others to do my dirty work.
 Logan was an idiot.
 We slipped him some blood when he started getting all poser slayer with that compass. I needed his family's journal. I couldn't let him die.
 I thought it contained the location of the witch's spell book. I was wrong. According to her journal, Honoria gave the grimoire to Johnathan Gilbert. And, according to this...
 He gave it to your father. So now you're going to help me find it.
 'Cause you and I both want that tomb open.
 What's happening?
 Mother!
 Seriously?!
 And forgot the lesson about vervain! She dates a vampire, Ben. Duh!
 Does it matter?
 Well, well. Elena Gilbert. You really are Katherine's doppelg√§nger. You must have the Salvatore boys reeling.
 I'm Anna. Your brother may have mentioned me. 
 Oh, I think she will.
 Trust me. No one I know wants to see that girl again. Except Damon, the lovestruck idiot.
 My mother's in there. 
 You really mean that, don't you? 
 Leverage. This belong to you?
 Ah-ah!
 She's fine. For now. Tell me you have the grimoire and she'll stay fine.
 Which means your brother has it. And I have the witch. So one of you had better meet me in the very public town square in 30 minutes so we can safely discuss how fun it's gonna be to work together.
 I'm leaving.
 Keep them buttoned down. Compulsion won't work. Just use violence.
 Sorry, I had to leave. I told your sister to tell you.
 Well, I gotta run, so-
 Go to what?
 
 Oh. It's there, huh? That sounds cool. Uh, I'll meet you.
 Okay.
 A party, right next to the old cemetery. Isn't that nice of them? Lots of warm bodies for starving vampires.
 Yeah, so do I. But your minus a witch and I'm minus a spell book. So what do you say?
 Then he won't be to happy if I kill her when I don't get what I want.
 God, it's like 1864 all over again. You Salvatores are truly pathetic when it comes to women. Tonight. After sundown. Meet at the church.
 You've got to be kidding me.
 Shut up! Stop talking. 
 Weird hello but, okay. What's the matter?
 Come on, let's walk.
 This place is wild.
 I'm strange, remember? You okay?
 A dead someone?
 
 I would happily be a part of your non-scene, except, uh, I'm leaving.
 Yeah. My mom and I are moving away.
 Yeah?
 So, guess this is goodbye.
 It's nothing.
 
 Grab him and lets go. I'm taking him to meet my mother.
 Hey, hero. 
 Well, Ben's about to make a main course out of Elena's little brother. So, you can stop me or him. Your choice.
 You think you can stop me?
 You must have a taste for it. You scream and shriek and even bother to escape, but then you just come right back to it.
 Mother! Mother. Your boyfriend did this, you know.
 And Johnathan Gilbert. I made a choice a long time ago that it would be Gilbert blood that brought her back to life. I had Jeremy all ready to go but....
 
 No!
 I just wanted my mother back. Jeremy's fine. He's outside. I won't touch him.
 You wouldn't have helped me.
 No! No!
 Damon, please! You wouldn't have helped me, you know you wouldn't have!
 Last I saw her was Chicago, 1983. She knew where you were Damon. She didn't care.
 Sorry.
 Hey Bethanne.
 What are you guys watching? You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time? There are over one hundred and fifty channels. It's called a remote control. This button changes the channel. Hold it like this.
 No, thank you Miss Gibbons. Why don't you lie down for a while and get some rest?
 Jeremy Gilbert.
 Very respectable.
 Susie Sunshine gave me her car keys and her ATM card.
 I'll explain later.
 Yeah. How do you keep out unwelcome vampires?
 I think the witch screwed up that part of her hocus pocus.
 And you're a part of it.
 I've been in Mystic Falls since the comet, Damon. I'm up to speed.
 And everyone you've supplied with vervain.
 Nice to see you, Miss Sommers.
 I'm coming mother.
 Surprised?
 Change of plans. Sorry, I thought you'd be psyched.
 Alright then, step aside.
 She got this business opportunity; she's going to open up a little store. It has always been her dream. So yeah we're staying. And I'm thinking about going back to high school, so you'll be seeing a little more of me.
 Enough of homeschooling. I'd like to be a normal teen for once. But I have to ask my mom first, she'll have an opinion.
 Really? Haven't you exhausted the subject?
 What do you mean?
 You're kidding, right?
 Jeremy, I made it up ok? You were all cute and floppy and I wanted to make a good impression.
 Let's do the works. Pile it high.
 Ok.
 What are you doing?
 I can't.
 What are you doing?
 I needed some air.
 Out, I was out.
 I'm sorry.
 I could have killed you!
 I should have.
 How did you know?
 You know you can't tell anyone, right?
 You'd be surprised.
 I don't know. Maybe I'm a sucker for guys like you.
 Lost. Why would you confront me about it? Why would you risk it?
 I love storms.
 It's only Dracula. Yeah. He was a complete wuss. Never showered. Very smelly.
 First rule about vampires, don't believe anything you read.
 No, you don't. Cause you're not gonna be one.
 Look, I'm not gonna turn someone who learned everything he knows about vampires from Netflix.
 Why do you even want this? Give me one good reason.
 Hmm. Let me know when you can finish that sentence.
 Okay. We have some time. I'm not meeting my mom until later.
 The fact that you would even think it's possible to keep something like that a secret from your own family is just further proof that you're not ready.
 And a million steps down from "Maybe." I like your bracelet.
 Can I see it?
 Your sister doesn't know you're hanging out with me, does she?
 I'd rather keep it our little secret.
 Why would you give this to me?
 You only like me because of what you want from me.
 Um...You know, you should wear it. It looks better on you anyway.
 To what?
 We're back to that?
 So, you want a pity-turn? I don't think so.
 Do you even know why we turn other people? It's not to give someone a one-way ticket out of loner-hood. Okay? One, we need someone to do our dirty work. Two, revenge. Three, boredom...but, you know, that never turns out well. And then you know there's the obvious one. You love someone so much that you would do anything to spend all of eternity with them. Ahem. I'm sorry, but you don't fit any of those categories yet.
 So, yeah. Just make sure your thesis is clear, and she'll love it. See you later.
 Mom, hey.
 Yeah, the blood-bank was understaffed because of the rain. I was in and out.
 A friend from the library.
 He's my friend. What's the big deal?
 That doesn't mean he'll make the same choices.
 I've been on my own for a long time, mother. I can make my own decisions.
 He already knows.
 Jeremy knows. He likes it. And he likes me.
 What are you doing?
 Vicki? The one you thought was a...
 She's the reason you wanted to turn? You wanted to be with her?
 I'm here on behalf of my mother.
 I'm sorry about what the other vampires did to Stefan. Abducting him, torturing him...It wasn't supposed to go down like that.
 My mom is devastated; they tried to over throw her.
 She doesn't really do apologies.
 I haven't been to the local blood bank in at least a week.
 The others are gone, Damon.
 They weren't cut out for this town. After what happened with your brother my mom kicked them out and they took off. It's just us and Harper now.
 Sometimes you have to wear uncomfortable heels to blend in. I remember this event from 1864, I was supposed to enter before everything happened.
 If you're just gonna mock me can you move along please?
 What are you, his errand boy?
 I could ask her but you know, you've made it pretty clear that you don't trust us so why should I even bother?
 What is it?
 Why not? You were basically using me to turn you into a vampire so you could be with someone else.
 Really? And how would you like to define it?
 How do you know that?
 Seriously, Jeremy. What do you know?
 You're missing Elena's introduction.
 So, she has no idea you read her journal?
 What are you gonna do now? Now that you know everything that she's been hiding from you?
 As a monster?
 When I met you, you were just a part of my plan to get my mother back but then things changed...All the time we spent together...I would never do anything to hurt you, not now. You know that right?
 We're here to talk.
 Hey. Surprise.
 Picking up this.
 Starting tomorrow, I'm officially a student here.
 No. I finally beat my mom down.
 Do I really need to answer that?
 Yeah. I would.
 Stupid? Pathetic? Old lurky me?
 Yup.
 That's pretty much it.
 Do we have to talk about this all night? I've told you everything. I probably shouldn't have, 'cause that could get us both in a lot of trouble.
 Your uncle John wants us dead.
 Yes, I do. He's a hater, Jeremy.
 No. You're something else entirely.
 My weakness.
 Jenna's in the kitchen. She just opened the refrigerator.
 Hey. What's the matter?
 What? No.
 But I don't want to move on. I want to stay.
 So, what, you're just gonna give up, pack us up, and move us out?
 Please.
 No. It's about me finally getting to build a life for myself. Please, mama.
 It's getting impossible to sneak up on you.
 Sorry I woke you.
 So, listen. I...
 Good-bye.
 I'm back. Oh! Mom! Mama! Uhh! Please don't leave me again. No. Please wake up. You have to wake up. No.
 She was killed.
 I know I'm not supposed to be here but I don't have anywhere else to go.
 Look at you!
 Why? You didn't kill my mother, your uncle did.
 Who else would have done it?
 Are you defending him?
 They do want revenge, or at least they did, but that's why we separated from them. My mom wasn't after revenge; she just wanted her life back. I have to get out of this town, Jeremy.
 I've been thinking...you could come with me. I could turn you. I mean...you said you wanted me to. Here.
 It's my blood. If you die with it in your system, you'll come back.
 I know you, what it's like for you...being alone, always feeling empty inside, no one to understand. But when you're a vampire, you don't have to feel that way. You can shut it off. I can show you how.
 There's something you need to know. The vampires from the tomb are planning an attack tonight.
 I went to them. They think I'm with them but I'm not. They want the Founding Families dead.
 When the firework start.
 Then we can't be here!
 Well, then a lot of people are gonna die.
 They're already here, Damon.
 I don't care about that. I needed to find you. Come here.
 Please, make it stop!
 Ahhhhhhhh my head!
 Please...no!
 Jeremy. Don't trust Vicki.
 Jeremy.
 You heard me?
 Wait, like heard me, heard me, or did it sound more like a...
 I need to know you can hear me.
 Jeremy! Tell me you can hear me.
 I've been trying to get you to hear me for days. Yelling your name and screaming.
 What changed? I've been trying to get through to you, why now?
 You were dreaming about me?
 I'm here.
 We've got all the time in the world.
 It's fine. I get it. Why haven't you told her?
 Yeah, I know that. Now why haven't you told her, really?
 Well, it's kind of a push and pull. I'm pushing from the other side trying to contact you, and sometimes, like just now, if you pull...
 That's what I call it. I'm all by myself here. It's like I'm a part of your world, only no one can see me. I'm just...On the other side.
 Whenever you say you see her, I feel something. A darkness. And when I try to tell you not to let her in, something crazy happens. Like, she's trying to push me out.
 Just be careful. Try not to let her in. 'Cause she can't get through if you're not open to it. You don't understand how amazing it is to finally be able to talk to you. I'm all by myself here. I don't have anyone.
 I'm sorry. I know you can't feel anything.
 Jeremy. The darkness. It's here.
 Are you okay?
 What?
 I was just trying to warn you. I felt something bad. Dangerous.
 It's a two-way street, Jeremy. I only pop up when you're thinking about me. That's why you haven't told her. Isn't it? You don't want her to know you still care.
 I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
 Don't! Jeremy, please. Don't shut me out.
 Say you can hear me, Jeremy. Please!
 I am all alone!
 I'm not helping them.
 I don't care. Katherine is not a friend to you. Neither of them are.
 Jeremy!
 They're looking for Mikael.
 The vampire who hunts vampires. You don't want to wake him. He will kill all of you.
 How?
 Help? What kind of help?
 I guess if she had a stronger foothold.
 Exactly. Right now, I'm tethered to you. My only access point to your side is through you. But if she were to get a stronger foothold.
 She's bad news, Jeremy. There's nothing but darkness around her.
 You can't upset the balance of nature without a price. If she's using a witch's energy from the other side, you don't know what price she's going to pay.
 Tell her not to be upset. I was just trying to help.
 I shouldn't be here.
 No, I mean, I shouldn't be here, Jeremy. Why are you thinking about me when you're calling her?
 I can't stop thinking about you, either.
 What's going on? I can feel you. How can I feel you?
 Just a bunch of historical lies.
 After the founders stole from all the vampires.
 Safe from the vampires.
 I don't think all supernatural spirits go to the other side. I think some of them find peace.
 Don't tell her I'm here. She won't like it.
 What's wrong?
 Elena is Bonnie's best friend. She won't like what's going on between us.
 I don't know. Honestly, I have no idea.
 What? No! I'm all alone, Jeremy, I told you that.
 I swear. I'm not any danger to you or anybody, I promise. Hey. I need you to believe me.
 Then send me away. I'm only here because you want to be with me as much as I want to be with you. Send me away, Jeremy. It's that easy.
 Frederick?
 What are you doing here, Frederick?
 I didn't.
 I didn't take it, Jeremy.
 No. But it should be. Elena was right. I'm holding you back.
 I'm sorry I took the necklace.
 I just thought, with all the tomb vampires out, that maybe...
 I don't know where she is, Jeremy. I don't know if she's moved on and found peace, or if there's even any peace to be found.
 I just...I don't want to be alone anymore.
 Mamma?
