 Hi.
 Sorry. Rude. You have no idea who I am. I'm Jules, a friend of Mason's from Florida. You must be Tyler.
 So, I know it's weird for me to just stop by but I'm trying to track down Mason.
 See...that's the thing...he's not.
 So you'll call me as soon as you hear anything?
 Oh, I didn't get to say goodbye to your son.
 Hey, I'm here. No one knows where Mason is. He's missing. You were right, Mason was lying, there's another werewolf...his nephew.
 Hey, excuse me. Crazy question  do you know Tyler Lockwood?
 No, one is my limit.
 Okay, if you insist. How do you know I'm new?
 Thank you for the drink.
 No, it's fine. I'm just here for the night. It's a long story, I'm looking for my friend.
 Mason Lockwood.
 You do?
 He's missing.
 How do you know Mason?
 Tyler?
 You know, I'm not much of a drinker. I should get going.
 It'll help me sleep.
 You fool. You think you're clever, don't you?
 He's my friend.
 And why not?
 You're threatening me? On a full moon? How stupid are you?
 No, I don't. That's your vampire arrogance. You should be. I sniffed you out the moment you entered this bar, along with your pathetic wolfsbane. I've been at this a long time, and any other night of the month, the situation would be reversed, but tonight is not the night to pick a fight with me. You've been marked.
 It was an animal. A wolf. It came at us in the night.
 Yes. But my friends...They're all dead.
 Sheriff Forbes, hi. I'm Mason Lockwood's friend from Florida.
 Is there any news?
 Well, if it isn't the one I meant to kill...I'll have to get that right next time.
 Promise?
 Bite me.
 I'm not afraid of you.
 How's your friend? Rose, is that her name? Have the chills started? The unbearable pain?
 Did I mention the dementia? It'll eat away at her brain. Soon she'll be rabid. You want a cure? I'll tell you the only cure that exists  take a stake and drive it through her heart.
 Thank you for coming.
 Just to be your friend. Mason would have wanted that. I know about Mason and you.
 I know you're a werewolf and I know your little friend Caroline is a vampire.
 You can't sniff them out?
 Oh my god. You're brand new. How many times have you turned?
 Hey, I can help you.
 He's dead, Tyler. He was murdered.
 You want to know who murdered him?
 Your little blonde vampire did.
 She and her little vampire friends were behind it, Tyler.
 Is that what she told you? She lied. This town is crawling with vampires but don't worry, we'll get them.
 I'm your friend. There are others like us and they're on their way.
 I was right, wasn't I? Your little vampire friend, she was lying.
 I want you to understand that a vampire will never be your friend. It's our nature to be enemies.
 You need to leave here, it's not safe.
 Your old life. Your new life is just beginning. You have so much to learn.
 How to survive. You've triggered the curse, Tyler. It's important you learn what it means to be a lycanthrope. We live by a code of loyalty, we take care of each other. It's my duty and honor to help you. Please let me.
 Brady?
 This is a hard place to find.
 Thanks for coming.
 Positive. You have to be careful.
 I know, baby, but I want the boy more than I want vengeance.
 We have a problem.
 Excuse me, Caroline right?
 I'm looking for Tyler. You haven't seen him, have you?
 I know you're lying.
 Actually, it is.
 That depends. How badly do you want to keep her alive?
 Ask your brother. Where's Tyler?
 You made a mistake, Stefan. I'm gonna give you a chance to fix it.
 Right here. Want proof?
 He needs proof.
 I hurt her again, and she's dead. Bring Tyler to me, the clearing by Wickery Falls. You have 20 minutes until she dies.
 Get it out of your system?
 Brady, let's be smart about this. I just want the boy. It's our duty to help him, it's who we are.
 I know you're out there.
 Locked up tight.
 It's a little late to be waving the white flag, don't you think?
 I'm not leaving without Tyler.
 Let go of Tyler.
 I'm not so sure about that, tough guy.
 Let's try this again. Give us Tyler.
 Hey, come on in.
 No. Is it Brady?
 His brother died. You know that, Brady.
 I had no idea.
 What is it, Stevie?
 
 Tyler, hi.
 Is that all right with you?
 And we will soon.
 Listen. We kind of need your help with something.
 It's an old curse placed on both vampires and werewolves.
 Tyler, if we can turn at will, that means we never have to turn at all, not if we don't want to.
 You know her?
 Hi, Damon. Nice to see you again.
 So I hear you have the moonstone.
 This time, it'll be you.
 You know what the great thing about buckshot is? It scatters through the body. Maximum damage.
 Where's the moonstone?
 
 I should be asking you that. I told you not to come.
 Now we have to get out of here; Lock ourselves up before tonight.
 I'll give you a few minutes.
 Just a few, Tyler.
 What's happening to me?
 Everything I did...I was just trying to help Tyler.
 I didn't want him to be alone!
