 Sorry for the wait. If you're here for the gumbo, I'm about to break your heart. We just ran out.
 You know, I have a black belt in karate.
 The hundred dollar guy.
 It's a grandma's name. Call me Cami. Amazing, isn't he?
 No, but I admire. Every artist has a story, you know.
 He's...angry. Dark. Doesn't feel safe and doesn't know what to do about it. He wishes he could control his demons instead of having his demons control him. He's lost. Alone.
 Or maybe he just drank too much tonight. Sorry. Overzealous Psych major.
 So, do you
