 Hey.
 Oh, Ty, be nice. That's Elena's little brother.
 Working.
 Do you need another refill?
 Look, Jeremy, I really appreciate all the pharmaceuticals, but you can't keep following me around like a lost puppy.
 Hey, keep it down. I don't want to tell the whole world I deflowered Elena's kid brother.
 We hooked up a few times in a drug haze. It's over. You gotta back off before you ruin things between me and Tyler.
 Yeah? What do you want me for?
 No, Ty. I'm not having sex against a tree.
 For who? No, it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen, not here, not like this. No. I said no. I said no! Ow, that hurts!
 Just go, Tyler, get the hell away from me.
 I didn't need your help.
 He was just drunk.
 No, you're worse. You want to talk to me, get to know me, see into my soul and screw and screw and screw until you're done with me.
 That's what I know.
 Jeremy? Is that you?...Jeremy?
 Matt 
 Vampire.
 No! No! Get off! No! No! No!
 It's all I remember.
 It's all I remember.
 Finally you're awake.
 Wait, what are you talking about?
 I feel fine.
 An animal. What else could it have been?
 I'm OK.
 Why are you here?
 Did you see that look on Matt's face? That was suspicion. I don't want people to find out about us, Jeremy.
 Tyler is finally showing some interest.
 It's not cool for people to know. Ok? I'm older than you, and Matt and Elena would freak.
 You are?
 Thank you.
 Matt. Mattie?
 Fighting with Robert about my schedule. You'd think getting ripped up by a rabid animal would merit an extra sick day.
 I hurt.
 The kid stuff. Nothing with an "o" in it. I think they were on to me.
 Thanks, Jer.
 I hadn't really thought about it. But I could be talked into it. I'll meet you out there in a few.
 Like you care.
 I know you.
 Um...I don't...I don't know how, but...your face. Excuse me. Sorry.
 No, please, stop. Don't...
 No! No!
 No!
 What's happening?
 I don't know. An animal.
 A vampire.
 You did!
 Stefan Salvatore did this to me.
 Aah!
 No!
 No!
 What happened? Where am I? Oh, I ripped my stitches open. Ugh...
 I took some pills, man. I'm good.
 I rock. I scored 2 tickets to the Posers Saturday night. They're playing at the Rat.
 Don't be like that. Come on. I want you to go.
 Yeah. But it's not like that anymore, so now we can be friends and just hang.
 Screw you.
 Don't do that. Not while I'm working. I'll see you later.
 Hey, babe. What's wrong?
 Wait, no! Ty! No. Leave him alone.
 Tyler, stop it! Tyler! Tyler, stop! Stop it! Stop, you're hurting him! Tyler! Tyler, stop! Tyler! Stop it! Tyler, stop!
 It wasn't just for the drugs.
 How are y'all doing over here?
 Is there anything else I can get you?
 Here you go, Mayor Lockwood.
 Ugh, some class. Oh, your parents are gone. I guess we can be close now.
 You treat me like trash. I'm sick of it.
 Really? Then who are you taking to the founder's party?
 No. It'll be stupid and lame.
 Screw you, Jeremy.
 Why?
 So you want to dance?
 Maybe you could show me around. I mean, this place is amazing.
 Maybe I should just strip naked and give Pastor Bill a lap dance. I mean, that's why we're hiding in a corner all night, isn't it? You're scared of how I'm going to act? You afraid of what your parents are going to think about your date from the wrong side of the tracks?
 Great. Let's go say hi.
 Or we could just, you know, sneak up to your bedroom. As long as nobody sees us, right?
 What's a matter, Ty? You scared to stand up to your mommy? It's pretty pathetic.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Well, that's okay, Mrs. Lockwood. Tyler and I were just saying good night.
 I was thinking maybe I could make one more wrong choice today. I still have 17 minutes.
 I I'm sorry, I'm almost done.
 I think you might be in trouble.
 Oh, Elena saw me.
 It was very nice what you did for Stefan. Very romantic.
 Look what I found. "Elena Gilbert, take one tablet every 4 to 6 hours, as needed for pain."
 So she won't miss them.
 That's the beauty of choice.
 I really hope you're not one of those guys who, now that we're together, tries to change everything about me.
 Good.
 We can't hide out in your room all the time. Welcome to my other favorite party place.
 Yeah. It's cool, huh?
 What's up, Jared?
 This is Jeremy. He's cool.
 What?
 They don't mind, they're dead. Let me take this up a notch. Hey, Tony.
 She wasn't using it.
 It's no big deal, Jer.
 Shut up, Tony. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad.
 Those are my friends.
 Yeah? What am I?
 No, you are. You're the kid with the big house who's acting out because his parents died. Guess what  You'll get over it. You will pull yourself together, move on, and one day tell your kids stories about your dark period growing up. And I'll still be here, waiting tables at the grill, partying at the cemetery with a bunch of waste of space small-town lifers.
 Go home, Jeremy. If I want to feel like crap about myself, I'll just go back to Tyler.
 No, I'm good.
 Hey, man, you ok?
 You don't look good.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got you, I got you. It's ok. it's ok.
 Oh, man. That shower was so great. What did you give me?
 I did? Wait. I'm confused. How did we get here?
 Ok. Um, but first, can I have another hit? That blood was so good.
 I am so over Tyler, so over him. I knew from the beginning that I was only a piece of ass to him, but i thought maybe if he got to know me better, he might see something more. But no. Now, Jeremy, on the other hand, that's all he's ever seen in me is something more, and i like that.
 Yeah, yeah. So, Elena used to date my brother, and they were always together, so Jeremy would always be hanging around and crushing on me and...Hey, why don't you have a girlfriend? You're, like, totally cool and so hot.
 Don't you wanna be in love?
 Except when it isn't.
 My mom spends most of her time in Virginia beach with Pete. He drives trucks. I don't remember my dad, but from what I gather, he's not worth remembering.
 Yeah. I mean, I'm the screwed-up one. Matt's got it so easy. He's the golden boy. I mean, he's gonna get a football scholarship and marry Elena and have a lawn mower and some babies, and when i think of my future, I just come up blank.
 Yep.
 Nope, none.
 So what's that?
 What happened? We were dancing, and then...
 What?
 I'm dead?
 You're wasted.
 Ok, I had a really good time. I just wanna go home.
 Come on, move.
 And I'm going home now.
 Yeah, whatever.
 Hey. The sun is killing me. My eyes are on fire.
 It's good. Everything's good.
 I'm hungry. What do you got to eat?
 Could you just not talk so loud? My head, it hurts. I need quiet.
 Not good, Mattie. I hurt.
 My gums. My jaw hurts. My gum...there's something in my gums, and it hurts.
 No. Just leave me alone.
 Just turn it off!
 The talking, the chatter, just turn it off.
 No. Don't.
 I'm sorry I'm so much trouble.
 No.
 I'm starting to remember things, what he is, what he said. I remember you. The hospital, the...the rooftop, it's all coming back.
 He said that I need to feed. What will happen if i don't?
 I'll be dead.
 I don't want this.
 Is it better? Is it better? Will I be better? I wanna go home. Will you take me home?
 No!
 I'm sorry.
 Hi, Ty.
 I know.
 I'm so cold.
 I wish.
 I'm so scared.
 I can't control it.
 I am so hungry, Ty. And it won't go away.
 I want it. I am so hungry, Ty.
 Aah! Let go of me!
 Ooh! Don't you hurt him.
 Matty?
 Yeah. I'm okay.
 No. Matty, I just need some time to figure things out. Just know that I am okay, okay? Please don't worry about me.
 I don't understand why I have to stay cooped up here. Why can't I just go home?
 What is that?
 Hey, um, I'm hungry. Do you have anything to eat?
 What is it?
 What is it?
 Yeah, why can't I have people blood?
 Can I have some more?
 How long is that?
 How am I? You're kidding, right?
 Well, what if I wanna drink human blood?
 Oh god! Don't start with that whole 12 steps thing. School counselor has been down that road, and it doesn't work for me.
 So you've never tasted human blood?
 How long?
 Does this sketchy feeling ever go away? It's like I have a massive hangover. This daylight thing is a bitch. I need more blood. Where's your bathroom? I have to pee. Why do I have to pee? I thought I was dead.
 False alarm. My body's feeling really funky. It's a good funk, but it's weird.
 Jeremy.
 Oh come on don't you start. I'm gonna see whoever I wanna see.
 I would never hurt Jeremy.
 Oh really? And how long have you been preparing the "you're not good enough" speech? I'm assuming it predates the whole vampire thing.
 Or what? (Vicki grabs Elena by the throat and pushes her against the wall.)
 Let's get one thing straight, you perky little bitch. You had my brother whipped for fifteen years. Fifteen years and then you dumped him. When I look at you that is all I see, just so you know. And I'm gonna see Jeremy whenever I wanna see Jeremy, because I have some fun new toys to play with, and I won't think twice about ripping your little head off. You got it?
 Just contemplating the next hundred years. Why did you do it?
 You did this to me out of boredom?
 Now I'm bored. And all I can think about is blood. I just want some blood. I can't think about anything else. What is that about?
 Where?
 Like what?
 Whoa. How did you do that? Ho ho ho ho.
 Matt?
 Hey.
 In a minute. I...
 It's no big deal. Drop it already.
 They know where I live.
 I'm back now. Just let it go.
 My head hurts.
 Don't let him in. I don't want him in here.
 No, I just don't want him in here.
 What, you're following me now?
 Let me out of here.
 I'm fine.
 Mmm hmm.
 I told you to quit bothering me.
 Matt, he won't leave me alone.
 Sorry. I'm sorry.
 I'm fine now, but...I gotta leave.
 I gotta get out of here, Jer. I just...I can't live at home with Matt. He just doesn't get it.
 Come with me. If you come with me, we can be together forever.
 Jer.
 Help me.
 Matty?
 I can come back. Help me come back.
 I'm here, Matt. I can help you.
 Matt! I can help, Matty, but I need you to hear me.
 Matt! Matt!
 Matt. Please!
 I need you to listen to me very carefully. I don't have much time.
 It doesn't matter. I need you to give Bonnie a message.
 Hi, Matty.
 You were always so much better at being a part of this than I was.
 Sorry.
 I'm a ghost. It's all I got. And I couldn't appear if you weren't thinking about me.
 Suck it up, be a man, and show her what she's missing.
 You okay, Matty? You seem unhappy.
 I miss you, too. What if I told you there was a way that you could help me come back?
 You have got no business in the stoner pit.
 Touché.
 Right now, I can only come back when you're thinking of me. But there is a way that I can be free of that.
 I know this sounds crazy but I have help from the other side.
 The witch I've been talking to says that there's a ritual. She can do magic from my side to push me over to yours.
 I'll be able to come and go as I please...When I want, where I want. I won't have to rely on you.
 In a town full of vampires, werewolves, and witches, I'll fit right in.
 Matt! Relax. No one else will be able to see me.
 I can be a part of this life again, Matt. Instead of being on the other side all alone. You won't have to be alone anymore either.
 Concentrate on me, Matty.
 Just focus. This is a good thing.
 Now say you accept me.
 Did you just...?
 It worked. Oh!
 I'm here, Matty!
 Ah, I can feel this. I can feel everything.
 Makes sense. Our deal was that she'd help me do what I need to do.
 Well, if I want to stay here, I have to help her restore the balance.
 Klaus's hybrids can't be allowed to survive.
 Not Tyler, Matt. It's Elena who's the key to creating the hybrids.
 I'm sorry, Matty. But I want to stay.
 I'm sorry, Elena.
 What is she doing?
 Make her stop.
 Matt, please.
 I won't. I'll stop. Just, please, don't make me go.
 I'm sorry. I just didn't want to be alone anymore.
 Tell Matty I love him.
 Tell him that I watch over him...and no more knocking around with that blonde Original chick who almost got him killed.
 Matty, I'm here.
 No. Listen to me. It's not ok. Something's wrong. Look at this place. Matty, you need to get to your body and go back.
 Matt, no!
 Matt!
 Matt, I love you... But I'm already dead.
 Hey, guys.
 Yeah, Caroline Forbes. Last time I checked, that's my name. Are you guys here for lunch? Follow me.
 What's up, Bennett? You need more ketchup? I'm off the clock.
 No. Gotta go.
 Ok, so now you're officially pissing me off. So why don't you come out and say what you really want to say.
 There, you happy?
 A hickey. So slutshame me all you want but this didn't come from Damon Salvatore. I haven't even heard that name in all my life.
 I'm sorry. But there's nothing you can do to stop me.
 Was that really necessary?
 You're a dick. You can't stop me. This is my ticket out of hell, and I'm taking it. Katherine is gonna save-
 And I'll just keep coming back, again and again.
 I can't do the emotional reunion, Matt. I love you, and I'm sorry, but Katherine told me to ring this bell every five minutes until Mystic Falls burns. You should save yourself, that's what I'm doing.
 This is your home. This town means nothing to me.
 I can't go back there. You don't know what it's like. At least this way, when I die, I'll just be dead.Gone. And I'm okay with that.
 Daddy?
 
 Oh, well that's rich. Why'd you come to watch me blow myself into oblivion?
 I am not gonna stop ringing this bell.
