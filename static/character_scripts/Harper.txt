 Do you know what day it is?
 And what year?
 Thank you.
 It's Harper, sir.
 You seem like a very nice person. I'm sorry.
 I didn't break it, I swear.
 Who was that?
 Is that your boyfriend?
 I'll watch things miss Pearl.
 Maybe you should quit complaining.
 Where are you going?
 We're not supposed to leave. Miss Pearl made that very clear.
 This isn't right!
 This isn't right!
 Miss Pearl will be home soon.
 They just needed somebody to blame. Someone to punish.
 Uhh!
 You're welcome.
 This was never my home, Miss Pearl. I was just a soldier who was left to die. You saved me. I'm coming with you.
