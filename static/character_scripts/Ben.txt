 Matt Donovan. What do you know?
 Rough season, bud.
 You gonna be workin' here?
 Well, we can't all be Football Gods.
 So what's the plan? Cook line?
 Everything ok over here?
 I wasn't talkin' to you.
 Anytime, Bonnie.
 I didn't graduate that long ago. You're makin' me feel old.
 I always know a pretty face.
 Twice in one day. Lucky me.
 Oh, yeah? What's that?
 Does that mean that you're asking me out on a date?
 Well, what did you have in mind?
 No. 
 Don't sneak up on me.
 Where's Noah?
 They killed him?
 You're not very upset.
 Oh, the witch is totally crushing on me. Did you get the journal?
 Who are you calling?
 You're not, like, into him, are you?
 Oh! Mmm! Damn it!
 I know. I just-I keep forgetting.
 You found the Gilbert journal?
 Well, it's old and musty, and how am I supposed to know the difference?
 
 When can we go hunting again? This tastes old. I want fresh blood.
 Why did you choose me?
 There are plenty of bartenders to choose from. Why me?
 Anything?
 I thought this Gilbert was the brains.
 Yep. Wish me luck.
 Admit it. I can't sing.
 Come on, I totally trashed a Metallica song.
 Well, at least I could admit it.
 Yeah, well, next time, I'm going to throw out my Pearl Jam.
 Yeah. So, uh, what are your friends up to tonight?
 Elena Gilbert, right?
 Yeah, I remember. You guys used to hang out.
 Yeah, my friends, they all moved away after graduation, and I didn't. So we just kind of drifted apart.
 That tight, huh?
 Well, the check's paid. I'm all yours tonight. What do you want to do?
 What's wrong?
 I didn't mind.
 Do you want go?
 Hmm, like what?
 Okay.
 Okay.
 I wouldn't.
 Don't try to escape. Don't even move. Do you understand?
 I told her not to move! I did that eye thing that you taught me!
 That's why she's here. Motivation for you to behave. You know, you shouldn't be so desperate. You made it too easy.
 She wants to talk to you.
 Right. I got that.
 Sit. Behave. 
 Are you offering? There's water on the night stand.
 Come back in! Shut the door!
 Don't make me!
 Lock it!
 Witches don't have eternal life, right? So you guys can die.
 Ah. That sucks.
 It was Stefan. There was nothing I could  
 Yes, I did.
 Dark down there?
 I considered it. Then I thought, screw you.
 I don't care. She already gave me what I want.
 You know, I've heard about you. You don't feed. You're not strong enough to beat me.
 Is that all you got?
