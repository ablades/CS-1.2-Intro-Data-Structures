 Hi.
 
 You spilled my man's drink.
 That's no excuse.
 I'm not gonna take it easy.
 He touched your drink. You said show no mercy. I thought you'd be happy.
 Damon. 
 I brought you leftovers.
 Damon, I always knew you'd come back for me. I must have counted literally every brick on every building in all of New Orleans.
 Of course I have, I'm not crazy.
 You know when someone breaks up with you and there's a song that reminds you of them? First, you hate it.
 But then it brings back all the good memories of them. Counting the bricks is my song and I've been playing it for decades.
 So, you're just leaving me again?
 I don't want to live without you.
 I'm never gonna be able to forget about you.
