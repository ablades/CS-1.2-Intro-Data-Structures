 Did you just call me 'cute brag'?
 Small favors. I'm Liam, you're Elena. See how easy it is to remember?
 Is there something you wanted other than to destroy my self-esteem?
 Okay.
 This is good. Build her up. I'm sure she'll live up to these ridiculously high expectations.
 So she's perfect.
 So how long have you two been together?
 Was that recent? Because you two seem weirdly functional.
 So is a lake different from a swimmin' hole, or...
 Oh. Somebody's house or second house, whichever had the biggest pool. Huh. I guess I do brag.
 Actually, I'm glad I didn't meet her because then it would have been awkward when I did this.
 Maybe. I have a sneaking suspicion that's your type.
 On the Friday of homecoming weekend? No. I'm studying.
 A corn maze?
 Will Dorothy and Toto be joining us?
 And what's that?
 That depends. Are you gonna try and set me up with any more of your friends?
 Not when you say it like that.
 You're inviting multiple people to be your date tonight.
 What's Dr. Laughlin doing here? Looking hot.
 I thought the lab coat was permanently attached.
 You said that about... every scarecrow.
 Actually, it's two lefts and three rights. I pulled up a satellite image of this maze before I came.
 Question is, am I your type?
 Uh-oh.
 You're still hung up on your ex.
 Overly ambitious premed student, desperate to become a doctor so she can prove to the guy who dumped her that he messed up big time.
 Or that. I'm I'm sorry, I thought Stefan was 
 Yikes.
 Elena! Elena! Get over here!
 I'm not sure there's anything you can do.
 I don't think she can wait.
 "Deviated" is the medical term. Screwed is more like it. Either way, she's not getting enough air.
 Good. Stabilize her head while I trache her.
 Practiced on a grapefruit. Didn't end well.
 Don't sound so surprised.
 So that girl dressed like Lady Whitmore, I was ready to give up on her, and you were able to save her. How?
 Elena, she should have died.
 Name one.
 A reflex. The fluid in a newborn's lungs are...
 I thought kissing me was a fate worse then death.
 So guess who came into the hospital for a shoulder arthroscopy this morning.
 Lady Whitmore, the girl from the bonfire, the one you miraculously saved from certain death and I can't figure out how. Turns out she was here on a tennis scholarship before she blew out her arm last year. Now she needs to get her cartilage cleaned out every 6 months.
 But here's the crazy part. She doesn't remember getting hurt in the corn maze crash.
 I'm gonna take a look at her labs, see if she's not an alien or a super soldier or something.
 Since never, but if you rat me out, you can't be my date to the hospital fundraiser tonight.
 Doesn't mean it can't still be a date.
 You know those things are rigged, right?
 Well, when you say it like that, I sound like a loser.
 Sure.
 Hey. Wine or beer?
 Liam.
 Wait. Damon?
 As in the ex who died?
 I feel a little threatened, but I think I could take you.
 I'm sorry. What's going on?
 Hey.
 So I finally got a look at lady Whitmore's labs. Turns out they sent her home without doing the shoulder surgery because the injury doesn't exist anymore. Seems to have spontaneously healed itself, and all this after meeting your dead boyfriend tonight? None of this adds up. The only thing that's really clear is that you're not just a liar, but you're a liar with secrets, so you can tell me the truth, or I can figure this out on my own.
 Bearing the white wine of surrender. I owe you an apology. I checked Lady Whitmore's medical records again, and everything was normal, which I would have known if I had double-checked them before making accusations that were unfounded, baseless, dickish. Is that enough adjectives?
 Yeah.
 I'm sorry. Did you say coven?
 What the hell is she talking about? Her dad's trying to kill her?
 Elena, we have to do something. Definite signs of hemoptysis.
 You need to tell me what's going on.
 I'm not an idiot, Elena. I know you're lying to me, so whatever it is, just tell me, please.
 Dr. Laughlin, look at me.
 Come on, Dr. Laughlin. Please wake up. Check for dilation.
 Holy crap. What the... what happened to her?
 Call 9-1-1. I'll start CPR.
 Call 9-1-1, Elena. We need help. She's about to die.
 What are you doing?
 Elena, your face.
 Elena. Elena, stop! How did you do that? How did you do that?!
 You're what?
 I'll see you Monday, Elena.
 Caroline Forbes, the girl from the swimming hole.
 Ouch. And I was just about to tell you how sexy you looked.
 Slightly buzzed! Getting my ass whooped in shuttleboard upstairs.
 
 
 
 Caroline, what the ?
 
 
 Stefan. Hey, man.
 
 Uh... 
 We made out pretty hardcore.
 
 Not that I remember. Are are you into her or something? 
 Great! Can I get out of here, please? Because, like, I'm late for this party, and you're really weirding me out.
 Uh, warehouse party off campus. Caroline will be there if you want to watch.
 The bathroom line was, like, a mile long. I mean, look at all these crazy people here 
 
 Hello!
 I don't want to do this!
 I'm sorry!
 Whitmore Medical.
 
 
 
 I think she passed out.
