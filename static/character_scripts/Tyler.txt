 Hey, Vicki. I knew I'd find you here with the crackheads.
 Hey, Pete Wentz called. He wants his nail polish back.
 I know who he is. I'll still kick his ass.
 I'd love one.
 I'm not hooking up with your sister.
 Oh, come on, it would be hot.
 You know, you're starting to get on my nerves, Gilbert.
 Wow. Vicki Donovan says no. That's a first.
 What happened to her?
 Everybody back up, give her some space!
 She's fine. Now get out of here.
 I'm gonna kick your ass.
 Walk away, Gilbert. It's your final warning.
 Damn, that was like a death threat. 
 Hey, Vick. How you feeling?
 What are you lookin' at, Gilbert?
 You're her stalker. You tell us.
 She probably found somebody else to party with. Sorry, pill pusher, I guess you've been replaced.
 Ask him.
 She's never gonna go for you.
 Yeah, right.
 There's no way.
 Nothing, man, just ignore him, he's a punk.
 Look...there's Elena and her new boyfriend. Now, what are they doing? Oh, they're walking, walking, walking. Yep. Right into the sunset.
 While you just stand there looking like one of those little yard trolls.
 Let her know she made the wrong one.
 Yes, coach.
 Dude, this is an opportunity. Football's a contact sport. Sometimes people get hurt. Whoo! Ha ha!
 I think he needs a buddy pass.
 You don't get to walk on the field and act like you own the place after 5 minutes. Just hang one up there and I'll take care of the rest.
 Oh! Whoo! Welcome to the team, buddy.
 I'll see you later.
 I don't need to impress her. I already won. Now you're dead.
 The next time I see you, Gilbert...
 This blows. He can't start the guy. He just got here.
 Nothing.
 Is that Jeremy?
 Oh, what do you care? Don't look so down. You can have her when I'm done.
 Tanner's M.I.A. I think he had a little bit too much beer.
 What's your problem?
 Girlfriend? Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but she dumped your ass. Are you for real?! You want to hit me? I'm on your team.
 I don't know, dad. I doubt anybody's thinking about that right now.
 We're fine, thanks.
 So what you gonna buy me?
 What the hell does that mean?
 I don't think you're trash.
 Vicki Donovan. Do you want me to ask you to the founder's party?
 True. But it'll be less stupid and lame if you were there.
 I'm here for my mom. I was supposed to pick up a box of stuff.
 I'm fine. He's just being a punk.
 Hey. Would it make a difference if I told you I actually like Vicki?
 Uh, let's go this way.
 Line's too long. We can go around back. Come on, party's in the back.
 Me dancing? Not pretty.
 Yeah, if you like living in a museum.
 I don't care about what they think.
 Knock it off, Vick.
 Vicki, I swear...
 Let go!
 All right, later, man.
 Whoa, Vicki? Everyone's looking for you!
 What's wrong, Vick?
 You're on drugs!? Everyone thinks you're off on a bender.
 What happened in those woods, Vicki? Those kids that were killed. What did you see?
 Come here. It's okay. I'll take you home.
 Control what?
 What are you on? What drugs did you take?
 Okay look, I'll get you something to eat. Just sit back. Look, let's just get you home, okay? Whoa! Vicki! what is wrong with you?!
 What's going on here, Stefan? What's wrong with her?
 Screw you, dude.
 Hey man!
 I heard they're putting together a search party for Vicki.
 Ooh good. That's great. I figured you must have been goin' out of your mind.
 I was just gonna offer. You know, if there's anything I could do.
 Cider for the ladies. It's a Lockwood special.
 Sounds like a plan.
 So, what’s up with you and Forbes?
 I saw you two in the hall today. Don’t even try to deny it, bro. You're tapping that.
 Never is. Until you become "we" people.
 Yeah, "we can't make it to the party"; "we'll never miss a game"; "we don’t like the color red"
 Like I said, "we."
 What do you want?
 Go to hell.
 It’s an elective.
 
 What’s the other thing? Vicki? Let’s hang out because we did the same chick? Go be friends with one of the many other guys that she screwed, there is no shortage of them.
 I’m not gonna fight him, dad.
 Come on, dad.
 What do you want?
 Look, I don’t need your pity.
 Just go.
 I don’t know, ok? I don’t know.
 I need a ride
 Ok.
 
 Ten kegs? You know how much damage we could do with ten kegs? Duke's got it all hooked up.
 Yeah, a douche with ten kegs. Aka, my new best friend.
 What's the problem, Gilbert?
 Yeah, I didn't think so.
 Of what?
 Keep laughing, buddy.
 Done!
 I'll be right back. 
 Lighten up, Gilbert. I'm just asking you a question.
 It's a party. You're a partyer. There's no need to psychoanalyze it.
 No problem. Carry on just standing there. By yourself. All alone. The enemy of fun. Do you even have any friends?
 Swoop!
 Aah. Where's your date?
 Aww, is the honeymoon over already?
 After all that grief you gave me about liking her. I figured it would have lasted longer than five minutes.
 Well, good. I need my boy single anyway. 
 Yeah, well, I'm not drunk enough. So I'm just gonna go get another beer.
 Great.
 Be more creepy, dad. Not like your son is standing right here.
 You can tell all that by looking at her ass? Awesome. I'm gonna go shoot some pool.
 Guy's not even subtle about it.
 It's not my mother.
 Kinda got half a burger left.
 Are you serious? Where was she?
 What's your problem?
 All right. They say she OD'd.
 Apparently not.
 By whoever was with her when she OD'd.
 Maybe she saw something and...Hell man, I don't know.
 Check it out!
 Yeah. Let him try.
 I saw that.
 This way, I'll show you.
 Um...
 I know, me neither.
 He won't even notice. I think he's actually letting himself have some fun for once.
 Yeah, I was a dick to her, I was really bad. That's what I hate is I can't make any of it right. It's like I don't deserve to even miss her.
 I don't have anyone to talk to either.
 Whoa dude calm down.
 Dad, I'm sorry. I don't even know what happened. I was drinking and...I lost control. I can't explain it.
 By whom?
 I'm not really into the...
 Great!  You want to help me out with this?
 Hey man. So Caroline tells me you've been on your own for the past two weeks. Is everything okay?
 Dude, that's not what I meant okay? I'm just trying to...I don't know what to say.
 I know. Yeah, whatever.
 I have my car. I can take him to the hospital.
 I'll bring my car around.
 Here, I can take it.
 I said I was sorry!
 I decided not to.
 Let go of me!
 Yeah, okay.
 What the hell is that?
 That noise!
 What happened?
 Hey man. I'm so sorry. Look, I don't even know what happened.
 I left her a message telling her I was here.
 What is it?
 So the black sheep returns.
 Yeah.
 Then that's two years older than the last time you saw me, Uncle Mason.
 It's good to see you too. Come on inside.
 Hey Elena, thanks for coming. Come on in.
 Bathroom is down the hall.
 Today has been a big day of sorrys from people who really don't give a crap.
 The difference is in your case it was true. My dad was a dick.
 I found this in his desk.
 He won't mind, he's dead.
 Nothing, nothing.
 I hate him.
 Let go of me!
 Get off of me!
 I said get off me!
 Get off me!
 I didn't mean to freak her out. I don't know why I get like this.
 So how'd you get the chill gene?
 I don't want to be like this anymore.
 What was that? Like seven?
 What?
 Yeah, okay. Shoes off. Mud...my mom...
 Dude, I play three varsity sports. I work out four times a week and run three. I'm gonna say no.
 Starts out normal, I get angry typically over nothing. I'm an angry guy. I know it just amplifies and I just go off.
 Yeah, it's like I go blind with rage.
 All I know is I lose myself, you know? For that time I become something else and I hate it.
 What are you doing, huh?
 You looking for something?
 You drained your trust fund already?
 What's it look like?
 Hey man, whatever. Ask my mom I guess.
 Yeah.
 Okay, he's the champ, who wants to go next?
 Watch where you're going.
 Yeah, you walked right into me.
 You're kidding right? You hit me again, I swear to god...
 Your eyes!
 Safe territory, enough with the silence.
 What was that move you pulled?
 Don't lie to me!
 I saw something!
 I saw your eyes, they glowed.
 Reflection of a car headlight...
 You really expect me to believe that?
 In a minute. Good night mom.
 Yeah, we're good.
 Have you ever been down to those old ruins in the woods?
 Yeah. What do you know about it?
 What's the deal with the freaky underground cellar?
 Why not?
 We were just talking about the old Lockwood property. Thinking of having some friends over to the swim hole.
 Of course.
 Is it me or did Aimee Bradley's ass get hot?
 Where is Forbes?
 You guys are on the outs already?
 You busting us or you joining us?
 What happens after dark?
 Don't be a party killer.
 Alright, we'll be out of here.
 Not much farther, Aimee.
 I had to move the party so I'm moving the party.
 It's right around this tree.
 Oh yeah, come on.
 It's a ruin buried underneath my family's old estate. No one will know we're down here.
 Yeah, unless you'd rather I tell them not to.
 Oh yeah.
 What's the deal? Come on.
 Then why did you come with me?
 Ouch. Um...okay.
 Yeah.
 Wow...um...
 Hey! What are you two doing?
 No!
 It was you?
 Hey, Mason, got a second?
 Come on man; give me two minutes, alright? You can't keep dodging me. I'm freaking out over here!
 How do you know that?
 How does it get triggered?
 You blow back into town with some supernatural family secret and you expect me not to ask questions?
 You ever find that moon stone?
 What's so special about it?
 How was that barbecue?
 Are you still keeping secrets?
 Then I'm still pissed. Hey, you know I was thinking about that stone you were looking for. I might know a couple places it could be.
 Tell me how the curse's trigger.
 I think I can handle knowing.
 You want your stupid rock or not?!
 Tell me what triggers the curse!
 Wait, the guy died? You killed him?
 Were you?
 And it triggered the curse.
 Um, yeah, I'm not sure but I'm guessing it's in here.
 My dad, he was very kooky about his hiding spots but I figured most of them out over the years.
 It's all yours.
 Are you gonna tell me what's so important about this rock or what?
 Yeah, I'm not really buying that. Why do you really want it?
 No, I figured it would be in here, man.
 Since when?
 I'm fine, Gilbert.
 Wait, hold up. I'm sorry. Bad day, bad month. Listen, you were cool that day, at the wake. Thanks for that. I felt like kind of a freak show.
 Distracting myself.
 My place. My mom is gone all day. Empty house, fully stocked bar...
 Sure.
 You in?
 Have at it.
 Well, good for Sarah.
 You don't need to apologize.
 Yeah, sure.
 Yeah, let's see. What's Van Gogh got going on?
 What's this about?
 A little, but not much. You know, I've got something I'm actually working on. Come on, I'll show you.
 It's on the desk.
 What were those pictures about, huh?
 Answer me! Why? Why wolf pictures?
 You know what? You know what Jeremy?!
 How do you know about all this?
 A curse about what?
 About my uncle? Yeah.
 A wolf? I'm sorry, werewolf? No. I mean, not yet. Just saying that out loud, I sound insane.
 According to my uncle, you have to trigger the curse. Somebody has to die at your hands, like a murder or an accident. I basically have to cause death and then boom  next full moon I'm howling on all fours.
 Yeah, right. He had to tell me. I caught him. He's not here for me.
 He's here for this.
 It's a moonstone. I looked it up online. It's a natural rock but there supposed to have all sorts of supernatural legends attached to them.
 Because he wants it. I'm a dick that way. It's important to him for some reason but I don't trust the guy so I'm not just gonna hand it to him.
 No, we're good.
 It's...woah, hey.
 Okay, let's not play with the rock.
 Look, I'll play along for a little bit but seriously, give it back.
 You're lucky. You're cute when you're drunk.
 Give me a break.
 She fell!
 I almost killed a girl today.
 It was an accident. I was being stupid. She's okay though but there I was, y'know, and just for a moment, for a split second, I hoped she would die. Look, whatever this is inside me, I don't want any part of it. I don't ever want to feel that way again. I won't. I can't.
 Yeah.
 Mom, we got it.
 Look, you know what I think of Caroline Forbes. She's an insecure, neurotic, bitchy little twit.
 But the girl's got heart. She means well. You just gotta take the good with the bad sometimes.
 Hey!
 What? Why?
 What did it say?
 Nope. I gave it to my uncle.
 Because I'm done with legends and curses. I don't want anything to do with it, okay?
 Anyone seen Mason?
 So weird.
 It looks good.
 We've both been busy, I guess. Have you seen Mason? The guy's been AWOL all day.
 What?
 So he just left?
 Thanks. You look pretty good too mom.
 Listen, I'm sorry I've been a dick lately...a jerk lately. It's just...Have you heard from Mason?
 We should have cancelled this party.
 Come on, put your mask on. Let's just go out there and pretend to have some fun.
 We're really not supposed to be in here.
 You know, usually it's me corrupting you. I like this.
 She's probably drunk somewhere.
 Whoa, don't do that.
 Hey, that's not cool. What's wrong with you?
 Give me the picture!
 Are you kidding?
 Put the picture down now man.
 Okay, you need to calm your drunk ass down right now!
 I'm not gonna fight you.
 What the hell is wrong with you?
 How did you...?
 No, no, no! Come on, wake up! Sarah, open your eyes, wake up! This can't happen, oh no, this can't happen. This can't be happening! Sarah! Sarah, get up! Sarah! Open your eyes! This can't be happening! Not like this!
 Get away!
 Mom, the sheriff's here.
 What are you doing?
 Why? I did this. I killed her.
 But she's dead! You don't know what that means.
 No, you don't, Caroline.
 How did you...?
 Caroline.
 Not good.
 How did you know?
 About me. How did you know?
 That's not what I am talking about.
 You lied to me earlier. Why?
 You're lying.
 Hey!
 How did you...you're stronger than me?
 Listen, if you know something you've got to tell me because I can't handle this.
 I know.
 Go ahead. Keep dodging, keep changing the subject but I know. You're just like me, aren't you?
 Keep it up but I'm not buying it. I saw how strong you were. I'm not leaving here until you tell me the truth.
 You're a werewolf. Say it!
 Stop lying!
 Say it!
 I'm hot. It's like my skin is on fire.
 I have that. How can you be a vampire?
 Who else is like you?
 Just me and my uncle Mason but he left town.
 I know.
 I have no one else to tell. I'm sorry about earlier. It's just, I'm alone with this. It's gonna happen to me. On the next full moon, I'm gonna turn and I won't be able to stop it. I'm scared.
 Good, you?
 Don't worry about it, man.
 You two still on the outs?
 Vampires don't have enough problems, you want to take on mine?
 I have a plan.
 Kind of private.
 Matt's bumming pretty hard.
 I get it.
 Yeah. You can't be honest with him.
 It's not really fair to be with someone and not really let them know who you are. I get it.
 Right over here. There's a cellar that goes to our old property.
 You do?
 Watch your step.
 I'm guessing this is where Mason was headed the night he turned. It's this way.
 Mason bolted before I triggered the curse, but I found these.
 And these bolts and chains. I need new chains, but the bolts could still hold.
 I think that's what this place was used for. Full moons.
 I have no idea.
 "August 31   My body is changing. I'm edgy, angry, impatient. I get so mad, I black out and forget what I say or do. I'm not myself, not since Jimmy's death. What's happening to me?"
 He chronicled everything. 
 He taped his first transformation.
 Retractable cables.
 What's he doing?
 
 Four hours.
 Five hours. How long does this last?
 I can't   I can't do that. Caroline, whatever that was, I can't go through that.
 Why? What did you read?
 "Unimaginable pain. I thought it would never end. It was the worst night of my life".
 Why are you helping me?
 Why do you care? We've never been friends before.
 We've never been close. Not like this.
 Hey.
 Mason, it's Tyler again. Look, your cell's voice mail is full. I need to talk to you. It's a full moon tomorrow and...I found your recording and I'm freaking out over here. So, just call me back, please.
 Yeah...lunch at the Grill, I've got practice and I'll probably go out after. I'll be late.
 Hi.
 Yeah. Nice to meet you.
 Hey.
 This girl Mason knows stopped by the house. She said he never made it back to Florida. My mom is freaking out and she was on the phone with your mom when I left.
 We should get going.
 Maybe. This girl just seemed to think he would have called.
 Yeah, anyway...let's do this.
 Tell me you brought the wolfsbane.
 I have a water bottle in my bag, we can mix it in there.
 The guy at the hardware store said this set-up could hold up to 5,000 pounds.
 I have no idea.
 Still human.
 It's elastic. What should I wear? I don't think it's like The Hulk, where I get to keep my pants.
 What time is it?
 Not for a while. Mason's journal said the first transformation can happen before the moon hits its apex.
 A few hours. Maybe more, maybe less.
 Yeah. Mason said it'll diminish my strength so I can't break free.
 No.
 Don't! Don't!
 I'm sorry.
 I'm burning up. It burns!
 I'm trying. You should go. You should leave.
 It hurts. It hurts.
 There's nothing you can do.
 Get out!
 Get out! I don't want to hurt you.
 Leave!
 Just go, please!
 Just go!
 Caroline.
 No, I'm not.
 I'm okay. I'm sore, every muscle aches.
 Well, we don't know any of that for sure.
 Look, I really want to thank you. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there.
 What?
 Wait, no, wait. What is it?
 What are you talking about?
 How do you know that?
 Hey, Matt.
 I'll see you guys later.
 Hey. Where have you been?
 We need to talk.
 I just don't understand one thing.
 Why would you risk it? If a werewolf bite kills a vampire...why would you risk it?
 I could have killed you.
 I don't understand you, Caroline.
 That's not it.
 I'm sorry, it's...
 So what do you want from me?
 You know what?
 How do you know about Caroline?
 Do you know where Mason is?
 No.
 Just stop.
 No, Caroline would never do this.
 Caroline is the only vampire in town.
 Who are you?
 We need to talk.
 Fine.
 What happened to my uncle Mason?
 He's dead, and I want you to tell me what happened.
 Then let me tell you  Stefan and his brother Damon killed him, because Stefan and Damon are vampires, just like you.
 Is it true?
 Did you know he was dead this whole time?
 Did you know?!
 I trusted you!
 I got it, Mom.
 What do you want?
 You know how stupid that sounds?
 I can't just run away with you. I don't even know you. My mom would freak. My life is here.
 Like what?
 Then why did you break in?
 What happened to Mason?
 I thought vampires hated werewolves.
 Help, help!
 You want to be friends, great, we're friends. Will you go now?
 What's happening?
 What the hell is going on?
 Are you okay?
 I had no idea they would come for you.
 I'm sorry, but it's crazy now, okay? I don't know who to trust. You lied to me.
 Caroline...
 I didn't know what to do!
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry about your friends.
 It's not always like this...is it?
 Mason didn't tell me anything about it. He was gone. Dead I guess, before he could help me.
 Because of this rock he was trying to find.
 A moonstone.
 What?
 Yeah.
 I couldn't tell you.
 You're still here.
 That guy last night made it pretty clear that you needed to go.
 Somebody needs to explain to me what the big deal is about a rock.
 I don't know what that means.
 I'd never have to turn again?
 The doppelgänger?
 That's Elena Gilbert.
 I've known her my whole life.
 Caroline.
 It's important.
 Please, Caroline. I'm sorry about what happened, okay, but there's so much we need to talk about.
 Matt, there's nothing going on.
 She's going to Dunham Lake. Her family has a house up there.
 Yes.
 Don't move!
 I don't think so.
 I can't let you break the curse.
 You're liars, all of you.
 Oh, yeah? But I do.
 I can't be like this forever.
 Elena will be fine!
 Tell me what?
 I didn't know what they were gonna do to you. I didn't. I just...I don't want to be like this anymore.
 I'm sorry, Elena.
 Matt.
 I need to say something.
 I've been going through a rough time, something I can't really talk about, and Caroline's been helping me through it. She's been there for me more than anyone's ever been there in my entire life, and I kind of fell for her. I don't know how anyone wouldn't, because she's pretty incredible. But she loves you, and she needs you, and to be honest, she deserves someone like you. So you be good to her, OK?
 See you around, Matt.
 I'm sorry about Brady and your friends, but if I'm gonna go with you, no more lies.
 I can't stay here, not like this.
 Mom.
 I'm back.
 What are you doing here?
 She's my mother. I had to.
 Thank you.
 I got it.
 She's just making sure I'm safe.
 She's been helping me. How are you?
 She's banged up, but she'll be okay.
 I'm hanging in there.
 Yeah. I should get going. Jules and I need to get on the road.
 I left for a reason, Caroline.
 Well...Take care of yourself.
 You all right?
 I already tried.
 Who were they?
 Who the hell is Klaus?
 The whole sun and moon curse is fake?
 And you think that's why they grabbed us? For the sacrifice.
 He's going to kill us?
 This whole time I've been gone, Jules has been helping me come to terms with what I am. How to deal with it. I guess none of it matters anymore.
 You want to talk about this now?
 I knew you hated me. I thought you deserved better than having someone like me in your life.
 Matt knows about you?
 I need to get to my family's cellar. I can lock myself up.
 It's starting.
 I don't know if I can hold it off. Get out of here.
 Go!
 It's happening faster.
 Get out of here!
 
 You were right. I shouldn't have come home.
 You're kidding, right? This is the second time I've tried to kill you.
 I'm sorry.
 Hey. Hey. Come here.
 Oh, easy.
 Thank you, Caroline. For taking care of me.
 Like what?
 So does my mother.
 We're together all the time, it's not a leap.
 Right.
 Maybe he doesn't want to find him.
 What? He's into you, isn't he?
 But you kissed him? Probably screwed with his head.
 Sorry. I've gotta run if I'm gonna change and pick up Sophie in time.
 Hey! It's been kinda slow in that department. And....I am horny all the time now!
 It's a werewolf thing too. Just like I can't turn it off.
 I'll see you later.
 What was that about?
 What the hell?!
 Hey! What is your problem?! You're pissed that I brought someone?
 Okay, should I not be dating?
 'Cause if I shouldn't be dating, all you've got to do is say something. If you don't say something, then I'm going to keep dating.
 Don't do that, Caroline! I've already been there once with you, okay, and you said no. You shut me down. I'm not going back there again unless you make it crystal clear that you...
 Let's get out of here.
 Hey, mom.
 Rough night?
 Feeling pretty good.
 I'm sorry. She snuck out?
 Whoa. I think the cream's bad.
 Don't wait up tonight.
 Oh, and Caroline, she's not a prostitute.
 A lot of us like to keep to ourselves for the full moon, chain ourselves up. But there are some werewolves that like to gather in places were they don't have to do that, where they can enjoy it.
 Mountains, state parks, deserts, that kind of stuff.
 Yeah. Here. Give me your phone. I'll try to pull up a map.
 As Caroline likes to remind me, Stefan's in this mess because I bit Damon. I figure I owe you one. Have you talked to her today?
 Just curious. Here.
 That's your best bet.
 I thought I was meeting Caroline. You haven't seen her, have you?
 Look, man, I never meant for me and her being friends to be a problem for you.
 Yeah. Whatever.
 I can handle it. But thanks.
 Ahh. What is up with my taste buds today?
 That's what vervain tastes like?
 You put vervain in my coffee this morning. Why?
 Let's skip the part where we pretend we don't know about the vampires in this town. You were testing me to see if I was a vampire. I want to know why.
 What does Caroline have to do with it?
 Did you do something to her?
 Where is she, mom?
 What did you do to her? Where is she?
 You don't know about me, do you?
 You need to see for yourself.
 You think Caroline's a monster? I'm the monster, mom.
 Me, Uncle Mason, it's in our blood. It's our family curse.
 Thank you.
 It's okay. We're going to get you out of here.
 Would now be a bad time to give you crap about sneaking out on me?
 What are you doing here?
 Are you okay? Do you want me to kick his ass?
 What?
 No, this? This is sexy.
 Oh, come on!
 Forgot about senior prank night, huh?
 You're all lame. And I've got ten more classrooms to prank.
 Get the faculty toilet seats, and Dana needs bodies in the gym. Let's go.
 I'm kissing you and you're wondering about your ex-boyfriend?
 I think he probably doesn't have a lot of people to talk to anymore. I think he's struggling more than he lets on. I think that I love how big your heart is.
 I'm happy.
 Caroline!
 Get off of me!
 Where am I? What happened?
 What's going on?
 I'm great, Caroline. I mean, like, phenomenal. It's a rush. I wish I could explain it. Everything's just...Better.
 This is going to be an amazing year.
 Donovan! What are you doing? Come on, man. Let's go!
 You talking to yourself?
 We're seniors, man. Life is good.
 Happy first day!
 What's going on?!
 Chill out. It was just a blood bag.
 Rebekah hooked me up.
 Klaus told her to keep a watch on me. Protect his new asset.
 I'm his first successful hybrid, Caroline. Don't you think that's the tiniest bit awesome?
 I think we're done here, coach.
 I have a better idea.
 Shut the hell up so we can go get drunk at the bonfire.
 Coming from the queen of subtlety? Relax. I'm in total control.
 Drop it, Caroline. I'm fine. I've never been better. Klaus has given me this...gift.
 Damn, girl's got moves.
 Sorry I'm late. What's going on?
 You can't do that to Stefan.
 Yeah. It's not in Klaus's.
 Klaus made me who I am, Caroline. I owe him everything.
 I'm just going to go.
 What the hell? How did I get home?
 What is your problem today?
 I'm not anyone's pet, Caroline. He doesn't control me.
 The old me?
 Whoa! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. I don't want to be that guy. I hated that guy.
 I will. I promise. Just...Don't hate me. Everything I like about me is you.
 You're always running out on me.
 I consider that a challenge.
 Bye.
 What are you doing here?
 What?
 You should go.
 Hey, can't we diss the decorating and go grab a bite?
 I mean a real bite. Rebekah knows some people who like to be fed on. They're into it, we don't even have to compel them.
 Just keep the claws in tonight at the dance, okay? For me?
 Matt said he'd take her.
 She wants to go to the dance and he didn't have anyone to go with. He drinks vervain. She can't feed on him, what's the big deal?
 Matt's a guy, Caroline. And Rebekah is hot, don't over-think this.
 I'm here, hanging streamers and I have glitter all over my hands. If I'm sired to anybody it's you.
 The gym is flooded.
 Dance is canceled.
 Hey Stefan! What's up?
 Thanks, but I'm not the one throwing it. I'm just doing what Klaus wants.
 It's not a party, man. It's a wake.
 My mom would seriously freak if she saw all these people here.
 What are you talking about?
 I have no idea. I've never seen half these people in my life.
 Are those people all hybrids?
 What are you up to with Klaus?
 He is on to you, Caroline. Whatever you all think you're about to pull off- he's two steps ahead of you!
 You're lying to me.
 It's just vervain. She'll be fine. But I need you to get her out of here as fast as possible.
 Something's going down against Klaus and this house is full of hybrids like me that can't let anything happen to him.
 I can't explain it. I can't fight against it. I just know that I need to protect him no matter who gets in my way.
 I'm protecting her, Matt! This is the only way to keep her safe. Please. Just get her out of here safely. Get everyone out.
 Whatever move you're making, Klaus is gonna be ready for you. He'll kill anyone at this party if he has to.
 Are you okay?
 I'm sorry I stabbed you. It was the only thing I could think of to get you out of there.
 If you knew all your friends were gonna get together and try to take down Klaus, would you have left?
 So there you go. I saved you from your own stubbornness.
 I need you to understand, Caroline.
 Understand that this is who I am! There's nothing that I can do about it. Klaus can't be killed. I can't be fixed. Understand that I'm okay with it.
 Because it's better. I don't have to turn, Caroline. Not unless I want to. I never have to go through that pain again. If being sired to Klaus is the price that I have to pay, so be it.
 I never did before. The full moon controlled me. After everything that we've been through, you've been there for me through all of it. Don't turn your back on me now.
 Right.
 I got it.
 Nice shot!
 The point is I'm pissed at Caroline and Bonnie dumped your ass. The point is to get drunk and shoot stuff.
 So what's the deal with that? He is like your guardian now?
 Do you like him?
 I'm a hybrid, Gilbert. You can't kill me unless you cut off my head or rip out my heart. And you're not gonna do it with that lame ass crossbow! Go ahead!! Take a shot! Unless you don't think you can hit me.
 Thanks.
 Look, maybe I should go.
 It's not like that Elena.
 Compulsion-that's just mind control-like hypnosis. And being sired is...it's like faith. You do something because you believe it's the right thing.
 I don't serve him. Klaus released me from a curse that was ruining my life. I owe him for that.
 He wouldn't! And even if he did I'd be fine. I'm a hybrid.
 Again, he wouldn't.
 I don't know! Then I'd rip out my heart!
 You guys sound like Caroline, getting all freaked out over something you don't understand.
 You're over-thinking it. I can still make my own decisions.
 I got to go. Umm, thanks for the food offer, but...
 So everything went okay?
 You said you are sending them a warning.
 I didn't think that we actually have to kill anyone.
 Don't do it, Jeremy.
 I didn't stab you in the back!
 Klaus asked me to. I never thought he would try to kill you.
 He doesn't care about you. All he wants is to get his family back.
 What the hell?
 Jer! You should get home. Stay inside. Klaus isn't gonna stop until he gets all those coffins back. He is not done with you.
 I know you're upset but...
 There is nothing that I can do about it, Caroline! That's the point. I just wanted you to know that I understand why you can't be with me. Even though I want to put you first, before anyone, I can't. I'll never be able to. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just want you to know that.
 Happy birthday.
 You called? I'm here. What happened?
 Can't you just leave me out of it?
 Seriously man, can't you just get one of your other hybrids to do your bidding? I lost my friends, my girlfriend.
 What?
 A hybrid bite will kill a vampire.
 I'm not biting Caroline.
 What the hell is wrong with you? I'm not hurting Caroline.
 Sorry, I didn't mean to crash the party.
 Can I talk to you for a sec? It's kind of important.
 I take it all back. Everything I said this morning. Klaus can't control me. Not when it comes to you. I won't let him.
 I'm not moving on from anything. I love you.
 
 Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
 I came to apologize.
 That's the problem. Klaus told me to do it and I said no. And then...just happened anyway. Like, it was completely out of my control. That's why I had your mom call him.
 I thought, since he can resist compulsion, maybe he could teach me to resist the sire bound.
 I was cursed. Every full moon I had to change into a wolf. It was torture. Klaus took that away.
 Yeah, but I don't know how to just start.
 You don't understand! When I turn, I break every bone in my body.
 Okay.
 I can't. I can't.
 He's right, Caroline. Just go.
 Go, Caroline!
 What are you doing? What the hell, man?!
 Knock it off!
 I said, knock it off!
 These chains aren't strong enough. You need to leave. Run!
 You're better.
 I didn't mean to hurt you. I lost control. Again.
 Different. A little more myself.
 What are you talking about? I turned.
 I can't put myself through that again.
 Caroline, it's Tyler. I know I should have called sooner, I just kinda freaked out and left. But I heard about your dad and I'm sorry. I'm really sorry Caroline. I'm out doing what he said. I'm gonna fix myself and come home to you. I love you.
 You have no idea how much I've missed you.
 Did I mention I miss you? Bad.
 
 It's easier said than done. Besides, I won't know if it's broken for sure until I test it.
 I do feel different. I feel freer. Way more myself. All I know is I just turned about a hundred times in the Appalachian Mountains. If I can get through that, I can get through anything.
 Why?
 What else did I miss?
 But Klaus turned me. So if he dies, I die.
 Did she say we could share the bed?
 And if Klaus didn't create their line and they try to kill him?
 Klaus drew this for you?
 That's pretty creepy.
 Charming? Does Klaus have a thing for you or something?
 I'm serious. What the hell happened while I was gone?
 Then why'd you keep this?
 I think I'm gonna find someplace else to spend the night.
 What's he gonna do? Draw you another picture?
 I can pretend I'm sired if I have to. But I'm not gonna hide while he's macking all over you.
 I am jealous, but I'm also competitive. So hang on, I'm about to sweep you off your feet.
 I just got back in town.
 No, it's fine.
 - Klaus could get killed. And I die along with him.
 Or we let Esther come and kill him.
 It would be an option if we knew he wasn't the one who turned your bloodline. You'd be safe. At least he would be gone.
 Because I'm angry. Because I hate him! I should have never let him dance with you!
 
 Since he realized you're not gonna dump me for him.
 And he still thinks I'm sired to him. It's fine, I'll keep up the act and it will all be over soon. I'm late, I gotta go. I love you.
 What's her deal?
 Elena?
 Shhh.
 I'm not your little bitch anymore.
 By breaking every bone in my body a hundred times for the girl I love.
 Is it? 
 You didn't give a crap about me! You just didn't want to be alone!
 Come on.
 Yeah, he would have taken you right down to the hospital, bro.
 
 Let's just say it's been a long time coming.
 Hang on. Do you guys hear that?
 That is the sound of a Klaus-free life.
 We're on it, as soon as we make sure no one is lurking in the closets.
 Mom?
 What's going on?
 Woah, wait a minute, you want us to run?
 Yes, we can.
 And our mothers need us to stay alive. 
 I'll get stuff together and meet you at the cellar in two hours.
 We've got to travel light, so what do you need?
 I'll call Bonnie, okay? Two hours, don't you dare be late.
 Caroline?
 Hey. Sorry, I was just with Bonnie.
 What happened?
 You're going to be fine, Caroline.
 There's no point. I'm a lost cause, but you're strong and you have a beautiful future ahead of you. And when you make it through this, just tell my mother I left town like I was supposed to, okay?
 Do you feel anything?
 I need you to get out of here. I don't want you to watch me die.
 No.
 You run. Or I'll make you run.
 Go!
 
 Grief sex. It's healthy.
 It's natural. Besides, if we stopped having sex every time somebody died in this town, we'd explode.
 Oh, come on.
 I love you. How's that for sensitive?
 Who the hell is that?
 Mom? What's going on?
 Is there something I could help you with?
 This guy knew what he was doing. His gloves must have been steeped in vervain. He was looking for a vampire and he didn't hesitate for a second when he found one.
 Being sensitive to the community's loss.
 I'm not letting a hunter stop me from where I'm supposed to be.
 Blood.
 Excuse me. I just wanted to say a few words about Pastor Young.
 Back in first grade, I was a brat who couldn't be bothered with team sports. Didn't care much about anything that didn't affect me. But he was the one who made me understand how important it is to be part of a team; a community. Of giving yourself up for the sake of...
 I'm gonna kill that bastard.
 Who the hell are you two?
 
 
 Nice to know you care.
 Yeah, well you used my body as an escape hatch, then kissed my girlfriend. So, maybe we're even.
 
 I should have called.
 I didn't want anybody to follow me back.
 Werewolves weren't safe around Klaus, and you shouldn't be here, either. His hybrids are all over this house, and so is he.
 Sure! Absolutely.
 Hybrids. I'm on house arrest.
 Not my mom, Caroline.
 You should go to the party. I'll be fine here.
 Trust me, I am no fun right now.
 
 Whatever you think you know...
 
 I said stop!
 I called in the hybrids to help too.
 He shot me like nine times. If we're killing him, I want in.
 Look, man, this guy is dangerous. He's highly trained. He's armed.
 This is a bad idea.
 Just listen to her, man. It's suicide.
 Klaus told you to take Connor on by yourself and you can't even fight back? You have to use non-lethal force. What the hell is that?
 Look, I'm a hybrid. I used to do everything Klaus said, but I don't anymore. You don't have to either.
 Hey, Klaus.
 I can do whatever I want. I'm not sired to you anymore.
 Do whatever the hell you want.
 I am so sorry.
 Caroline, it's not like that.
 You have to understand...
 I never fell for her.
 Caroline, she saved my life. I almost died trying to break the sire bond. Hayley was there for me, she helped me get through it, but nothing else happened.
 Because I'd rather him think that then know the truth.
 There are other hybrids that need to be set free. Hayley and I can help them. But if Klaus found out about what we're trying to do, he'd kill us all.
 You're still going? I drank enough last night and then I slept, which is what you guys should have done.
 That's great, Chris, but could you pay them at a bar instead?
 I didn't know you were here.
 What do you care if Connor's dead anyway?
 Care, this isn't a good time.
 For what?
 You girls are good liars.
 Hayley is the one that helped me break the sire bond. She showed me what to do, how to help. When she showed up here I thought it was just coincidence, but it turns out she's been helping one of them, her friend Chris. And she came to help us get the rest of them out from under Klaus.
 Thanks for meeting us.
 No, he won't.
 Please, man, help us and then you can disappear. You'll be free.
 Hayley and I got your back. We'll make sure nothing happens.
 You're doing a good thing, Chris.
 It's not his fault, it's mine. I was distracting you. It's my fault she got away!
 Hayley...
 Jeremy?
 What the hell, man?!
 
 I told him we had his back. I told him if he helped us he'd be free.
 Yeah, we helped our friend by handing over another friend.
 Chris was a friend, Caroline. He's like me. He's part of my pack. All he wanted to do was be unsired by that disgusting piece of...
 Nothing. Nothing at all. Just celebrating the life of a fallen hybrid friend.
 Caroline bought us another day. Klaus wants to go with her to Miss Mystic Falls tomorrow.
 Watching Klaus fawn over Caroline at some lame-ass pageant? No thanks.
 Fine, we'll go.
 Wear a dress.
 You don't want to do that. Those girls will cut you. They have nails.
 They don't. Paranoid much?
 Dad. What about your parents?
 You never told me how it triggered.
 So, what's with you chatting up all these old-timers, huh? My mom...That professor guy.
 You know him or something?
 No reason.
 A bunch of BS about being human. The sooner we get rid of this guy, the better.
 It's over. Nice work. We're one step closer to ending this.
 Yes, you can. Block out the pain.
 Hayley is right. The bond isn't broken until he doesn't feel the pain of transformation anymore. If we want to get back at Klaus for everything he's done to us, Adrian has to keep turning.
 Kim is right. The point of breaking the sire bond is being free. They dont have to listen to me.
 Long day tomorrow Adrian. You want it to go better than today, you need to get some rest.
 The guy telling you to call it a night.
 This could get a lot uglier right now but I'm not gonna let it. Challenge me again, this conversation will end differently. You understand?
 Finish your drink and get Adrian back to the stables. We'll meet you there.
 I get it, Hayley. I'll find them and I'll get them in line.
 They've gotta be here. They're not dumb enough to risk getting caught by Klaus in town.
 Kim is trying to prove that she's the Alpha. If I can make her submit, the pack will fall in line and we can finally get them free of Klaus. You'd think they'd play along with how much they hate him.
 Being sired doesn't mean you feel differently about someone. I hated Klaus but I still did everything he said. The bond affects how you act, not how you feel.
 Caroline.
 Stop! Stop it, Kim. Caroline's with us. All right? We're all on the same team.
 Stop it! Stop!
 Kim! Don't do it. I swear to God!
 Stay back! I'll rip her heart out right now!
 Kim put you all at risk today but I'm not gonna hurt her. I'm not Klaus. I don't kill and torture my own friends to get what I want. Now, we broke the sire bond, but if you want to be free we have to work together. No one can step out of line. Now, you're either with me or you're against me. Submit. Submit or you die.
 You won't have to take it much longer.
 We promised you guys we'd free you from Klaus. You did your part by breaking your sire bond, now Hayley and I are gonna do ours.
 Hayley found a witch strong enough to do the body jump spell. You know, the Klaus specialty.
 We'll encase the body in concrete then bury it.
 Because to do that spell, you have to stop a human heart. I was a little short of volunteers.
 Okay, don't freak out.
 It's not forever. Just long enough for the hybrids to be able to completely disappear.
 This started with me. This has to end with me.
 I need your support.
 Well, that's not gonna happen.
 You told him?
 I've had twelve hybrids sworn to secrecy for a month. I have Hayley and a witch risking their lives and you're blabbing my plan to him?
 How long? An hour? A day? Because every minute that goes by that we don't do this, they're at risk. You and Klaus already served one of them up for Jeremy to kill.
 I don't owe you anything.
 I'm taking him out.
 Sorry man, but you don't have a choice.
 Keep them down here until we're ready to bring Klaus in. 
 I know what it's about for you, Stefan. It's about the cure. You know what happens to a hybrid when he's cured of being a vampire? We go back to being werewolves; turning on every full moon. We could give a rat's ass about the cure.
 I needed you on my side, Care. That's all I wanted.
 Please say something.
 I'm their Alpha. They're looking to me to help them.
 Thank you, Mom.
 How the hell did you even get out?
 I'm not going to fight with you anymore, Caroline.
 We've been through this; I don't have anyone else's body.
 Call Bonnie.
 Make sure it will work.
 It's a brilliant plan, Hayley.
 You're a genius. I love you.
 I gotta go find my mom. Let her know I might actually graduate.
 Hey mom, I don't see you. Things have changed, it's gonna be fine.
 I'll be back later. I'll pick you up.
 What are you doing here? You're supposed to be taking the witch to the Cellar.
 What?
 The what?
 What are you talking about? What kind of deal?
 Twelve what?
 Hayley, what did you do?
 Screw this.
 I told you, I don't wanna talk.
 Rebekah?
 And why would I do that?
 What the hell is going on?
 But if I turn, I'll kill them.
 Agh! I can fight this!
 
 I'm so sorry.
 Yes, it was. This whole thing...it's all my fault.
 I should have saved her.
 Morning, sunshine. You look pathetic.
 My friends will be back with the cure by then. So, I could shove it down your throat and make you mortal.
 You know what I think? I think that's impossible. I think the moment you stop being a vampire, our whole blood connection to you is broken, and your sire-line ceases to exist. So, whatever happens to you, happens only to you, which means I can kill your ass and no one else has to die. Although I am still debating just how to do it.
 Gloating.
 He destroyed my life. I plan on being present for every second of his misery until I can kill him myself.
 No!
 Hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me. I can fix this.
 I know. I'll fix it.
 She'll die if you don't heal her.
 Is this what you want? To remind me that I'm powerless against you? Fine. You win. I'm nothing. Now save her. Please.
 Please.
 Please save her life.
 I'll be your slave again. I'll do whatever you want. Just help her.
 
 No. It's my fault. I'm sorry.
 I unsired the hybrids and turned them on Klaus. I should've just left it alone.
 Then you trust me?
 You want to be in control, Klaus? Here. Now you get to be in control of her life. If you want her to die, fine. But then you can sit here and watch her die yourself.
 I'm just trying to help my friends find the cure.
 Found this in your attic.
 You tell me. I was playing around with the handle on the ride over, and I found this.
 
 What are you doing?
 Every time I think I have him, that son of a bitch gets the upper hand.
 If they get to it first! And if they don't, Klaus kills me. 
 He's got nothing to lose, Care. His brother's dead, his hybrids are gone. All he wants right now is blood, starting with mine.
 At least this time we have a minute to do it the right way.
 This isn't goodbye. This is...until we find a way. We're immortal, remember? We will find a way.
 
 Dear Care, I miss you more than I can put into words, but I know as long as Klaus is alive, I can't come home. He won't stop trying to kill me, and you won't stop trying to protect me. Which means the only way to make sure you're safe is for me to go and never come back. I left Matt the deed to the house. It will protect you in ways I can't anymore. I will always love you.
 I don't think you've ever looked more beautiful.
 Can't get in. Matt owns this place now. He had to invite me inside.
 He won't. You didn't really think I was gonna miss prom, did you? 
 I have to go soon. People will be here for the party, and if anyone sees me...
 
 How about we don't talk about my major right now? 
 Definitely don't want to talk about my dorm room.
 How many times do you want me to tell you? I've been helping a werewolf pack in the land of no cell phone reception.
 I thought I did make up for it a couple dozen times. 
 The what?
 Seriously?
 Wow. All of this and you weren't even on the dance committee.
 Did I mention you're the hottest serial killer in here? 
 
 
 Look, Care. I didn't just come back here to get you in bed.
 No. I mean 
 
 Look, Care. I can't do the college thing right now.
 Do you know the reason we're together? It's because Klaus granted us permission to be together. I'm sorry, but I can't live like that.
 No. This is about me. He killed my mom and got away with it. I can't just start caring about sociology and frat parties.
 I didn't come here to give it a chance.
 I need to go after him. I need to find a way to destroy his life like he destroyed mine.
 Hey.
 Care 
 I don't want that either.
 I'm sorry, Care. I can't do that.
 Me.
 Rebekah says to tell you that I'm her parting gift.
 Hey, Care.
 Here. Join me for breakfast.
 Well.. there were witches, gumbo..a few originals. Look. it doesn't matter because it's over.
 Yeah,  but it means you'll have to invite certain people in tonight. People like Elena, Stefan...
 Pretty much.
 Just get the cups, okay?
 Get out.
 No. Let me. Klaus killed thousands of people; Elena's aunt, an entire pack of hybrids - my friends- Caroline, he killed my mom.
 Just stop. I walked out last time. Now, It's your turn. Go.
 Don't take another step, Caroline.
 I said LEAVE!
 You don't know? She screwed Klaus.
 You know what I realized tonight?
 This is a big-ass-house. I live in a freaking mansion. My parents are dead.. the girl that I love slept with my nemesis and I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do with the rest of my life. Which, get this, lasts forever.
 but I got a big-ass-house.
 Klaus put me through hell in New Orleans, man. He crushed me and just when I thought it was over, that he couldn't destroy anything else, or do anything worse,...
 Give me whatever will obliterate the memory of Caroline.
 No. I said I wasn't drinking alone today. She's new.
 I want a shot. Let's do shots.
 Well, you heard her. She's sorry, her mom's dead. Let's do shots.
 My mom was so afraid I'd flunk the eighth grade and embarrass her, she actually wrote an entire English paper for me.
 Ooh.
 Cheers! (They clink their shot glasses and drink.)
 Afraid so.
 Wow! Kind of forgot about that one.
 Up top!
 Ahh. I have to pee.
 Hilarious. (they laugh)
 Pour another round.
 Really? Where the hell's your vervain?
 You see? She swiped it and probably compelled you not to notice.
 I have no idea. Is there any vervain here?
 Drink some, now.
 So. Was I right?
 What happened? Where's Nadia?
 She snapped my neck. What the hell kind of misunderstanding is that?
 She wanted to talk about Katherine?
 A little friendly advice  stay the hell away from her.
 Hey. Have you talked to Matt?
 Because it turns out that Nadia has been compelling him to forget things.
 Matt said he was going to avoid her, but I haven't heard from him.
 I think he hasn't been at home or work and his phone goes straight to voicemail.
 Nice try, but you don't take anything with silence.
 He's not missing, he just hasn't been home for two days and he's not answering his phone.
 Kind of wondering the same thing. Where the hell have you been?
 So why haven't you been answering your phone?
 I don't want to be part of this.
 From what? This is Matt we're talking about. Did you forget that time he went to Europe with Rebekah after she ran his truck off the road?
 Hell of a lot easier to buy than other things that have happened.
 Young hybrid beats old vampire all the time.
 Well.
 Car. I never said sorry.  I was pissed, but no excuses, okay?
 I said I was sorry. I didn't say I was past it.
 How evolved do you think I am? You slept with Klaus. You slept with the guy that killed my mom. What's the fair amount of time for me to get past that? A week? A month? Tell me, what sounds right to you?
 Look. I'm not trying to be a dick, but the idea of us being good... It's not gonna happen.
 She was at my house... How did none of us figure it out?
 
 
 Fat chance you'll be seeing her today. I'm pretty sure I bit Nadia.
 I mean, she was attacking Caroline, and I might've nipped her a little.
 You just had your lunch 30 minutes ago.
 Not going to happen.
 Do I have a choice?
 I'm a hybrid. and you need a babysitter
 
 Not especially.
 You think Elena will still want you back after this? It's over Damon, fix yourself and run far away.
 You think Elena is going to forgive you? Look at you! You killed her friend, you almost killed her brother, you almost killed HER. You're a joke, Damon!
 You dont know anything about me.
 
 I said, I'm fine!
 Why do you think? Damon knew exactly how to piss me off.
  I think Damon went to go find Wes...
 You've done nothing for me.
 Victorious?
 But, you see the good in people.
 Your words. Not mine.
 I don't know, Care. Maybe people just expect more from you?
 The breakfast of champions.
 At least he's not looking for answers at the bottom of a glass.
 Woah. TMI.
 So, what's up with those two?
 You left out the part about her being hot   like, weird hot.
 I have no idea. I can't hear anything.
 It's rude to leave Jeremy hanging.. even for a newbie witch.
 Even Damon, sometimes.
 Yeah. She showed us that trick before too.
 I'll do it.
 Dude, you have a magic ring that brings you back from the dead. Quit bitching.
 Where are you now?
 You'd start at the top. Don't do anything stupid before I get there.
 Hey, Sheriff.
 Yeah. You know me.
 Right. Will do.
 My mom says hi.
 You're ok. You're safe now.
 For starters, relax. Matt said he was out for a while when this happened to him.
 They won't. I got it handled, I promise.
 You're welcome.
 Where the hell am I?
 Dead.
 Yeah. Bad dream. What were you saying?
 Oh. Look. I'm always up for a little bit of kink, but 
 Where are we going?
 Today?
 We have a problem. Markos turned Sloan into a vampire, had her drink doppelgänger blood, and after some chanting ritual thing, she turned human again.
 He cured her to death. The blood took away her vampirism but left her in the state that she was in just before she turned.
 The point is they feel if they can get rid of all magic they'll break some lame-ass witch curse.
 No idea. They were moving camp when I got out.
 How am I supposed to do that?
 These should hold. Let's do this.
 Some freak is inside my body. He took over my life. God only knows what he's got planned for me, so unless you've got any better ideas, this is what we're doing.
 What do you mean you lost Julian's body?
 Hold on. What do they need his body for? Guys, talk to me. Why did they take it?
 I'm seeing things.
 I don't know what the hell's happening. It's like I'm seeing his life. God!
 Make it stop. Make it stop!
 Bonnie?
 How the hell did I get here?
 Hang on. Did you say I'm dead?
 Do I have a choice?
 What about everybody else?
 Yeah! It's me.
 Woah..
 That felt different..
 I'm not a hybrid anymore.
 What's going on?
 Caroline, you're coming.
 and you hounded me for an entire year! So here I am.. Now get your ass back here.
 Sorry I'm late.
 Sorry princess. Just trying to check what page we're on.
 Oh. Watch it, dick! Whoa, sorry. Still working out the kinks of being human. My tolerance blows. (he drinks beer)
 My issues are under control. Coach lets me practice with the football team. I get to kick ass in a controlled environment.
 Alaric, chill. It's under control.
 Really?
 Where are you? The game's gonna start in, like, 15 minutes.
 Whoa. Slow down, what?
 This makes no sense.
 Is she ok?
 Let me deal with him.
 She's not coming. Apparently, she's not in her right mind.
 Is this what you've been up to all summer? Messing with Elena's brain? Does it help with the guilt or are you just desperate for friends?
 Why? So you can trick her into thinking Damon's alive? Who does that? She almost killed someone.
 Where's your magic now, Parker? What's wrong? You can't chant? You stay away from Elena, or you're gonna have a problem your magic wand can't fix.
 I got a little out of control. I know.
 Grief. It's called grief. Your brother got to live that day, remember? The rest of us lost people because of him.
 You're right. I'm sorry.
 Well, I will. Listen. Liv, 4 months ago, I could do anything. I could make anyone do anything that I wanted. I was stronger than most people on this earth. And then it went away. And all that's left inside of me is rage.
 Because I want you to understand that I am trying to deal with it.
 Why do you do that? I'm trying to talk to you and you just give me that look and walk away?
 Hey, quick question.
 Hilarious. We're having a party today, you think you could spare a keg or two from scull bar? You can come...
 I'm working on this, okay? I watch my drinking, I avoid things that make me angry.
 I don't know, man I've seen some pretty vicious dogs.
 I just got a text from Elena. She wants to see us.
 I think if that's what she said then that's what happened.
 And you're a wasted douchebag. We all have faults.
 So you want to fill us in on what we're doing here?
 Actually, I can't. I'm working on my rage issues, and this wouldn't help.
 I think we should go.
 Whoa. Was that always dented?
 Liv lent them to me man.
 Just lift the damn thing.
 Isn't this your friend Jay?
 (throws the trucks keys to Enzo.)Get out of here.
 Maybe this is an isolated thing. Jay could be working alone.
 I got this, dude. I'll see you in a bit.
 Not in the mood, Liv.
 No. Just a request.
 Is this what you want? You want to see my break?
 Why?
 I got to run some gear over to the football stadium later. If you want, I could pick you up after, and we could go together.
 Oh god.
 I was driving the truck, Elena.
 This guy ran right in front of me, and he's hurt bad. If he dies, I'm a werewolf all over again, ok? I need you to get here. We're in a ditch. I don't know where, but I need you here now, so please hurry.
 What the hell am I supposed to do?
 I hit this kid in the road.
 Look, it wasn't my fault. It was an accident.
 It doesn't matter. If he dies, I'm... Call Elena.
 I-I don't know what to do, I think he's losing consciousness.
 No. No. I... it looks like it stopped.
 Yes.
 Come on, man. Please, you gotta live. Come on, buddy. Come on.
 Come on, man. You can't die!
 I killed him.
 Yes, I did, Liv. Everything we've tried to do to keep me from this, and all it took was one guy running out into the road.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LIV, LIV STOP! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
 I talked to Elena.
 She said everyone else lived. You don't want to talk about what happened?
 You killed someone tonight. You can't just pretend that didn't happen.
 Liv. You. Saved. Me. I can never repay you for that. All I can do is promise you that I won't waste it.
 I never said I was a professional.
 Thank you.
 For letting me try to repay you.
 Honestly, I'd rather chain myself up in a cellar and turn every month than have to wear this lame-ass tie.
 Well, hello to you, too.
 Where's Luke?
 Do you want a drink? Once we sit, there's a good chance Caroline won't let anyone get up.
 Did I do something to piss you off?
 I think he meant "oven".
 Why them?
 Liv—
 The weaker of the two what?
 Caroline's out looking for you. She wanted to apologize. 
 You're talking to a guy with a gene that turns him into a wolf. Look. If you don't want to merge, then don't. Your coven doesn't control you.
 Let me help you.
 Good morning.
 You passed out, so I brought you home.
 I am protecting you, Liv. I'm not letting you sacrifice yourself because your coven needs a leader.
 Let them. Magic doesn't work in Mystic Falls, so if your coven wants to find you, they'll have to do it the old-fashioned way. They'll have to go through me.
 You'll make up for it next year. We'll find another way, Liv. I'm not going to let you die.
 I brought you to Mystic Falls to keep you safe from your crazy-ass witch family. You can't just leave because Damon wants you to do some spell.
 Well, actually... Look. Why can't Luke do it?
 Matt, help me out here.
 If you leave and your coven finds you 
 Hey. This isn't a joke to me, ok?
 I'll find a way.
 I think she did just fine. Let's get out of here.
 Kai is here. We have to get back to Mystic Falls before he takes any more of her magic.
 I'm sorry, Elena.
 What the hell do you want?
 Bottom line, we need to keep Kai alive.
 Right now, you two are stuck doing the twinmerge for your coven, ok? That means one lives, one dies, but if we help Kai and he finds a way to merge with Jo, it's not your problem anymore.
 Kai said Jo hid her magic in a knife somewhere.
 He checked. The knife's not there. He thinks someone took it.
 If we find it, Jo can get her magic back, Kai can merge with her, and you and Luke
 Is this Damon? Why don't I have your number saved?
 It's creepy you know where Liv's dorm room is.
 I'm trying to keep my girlfriend alive. Sound familiar?
 Why the hell did you tell Damon where they were?
 So you'll just risk your sister's life? How the hell does that make sense? Hey! I'm talking to you.
 Should I be wondering why you're in Damon Salvatore's bedroom?
 So you're shirtless in Damon's bedroom.
 How's the training going?
 Yeah, but you've got time to whip her into shape. Has Luke been giving you crap?
 If he finds out you're training Jo 
 What the hell are you talking about? You said you and Luke were equal in strength.
 Then we run.
 Fine. Then go.
 I'm serious. Go. That's what you want me to say, right? So, go. Walk right into your own grave, if that's what you want. I won't stop you.
 This wasn't a mistake. This wasn't a mistake.
 I thought you were about following your destiny.
 On the moon?
 Ohhh.
 Mmmhhmmm
 I'm serious. Look, pick a real place.
 Ignore that (kisses Liv's shoulder)
 Olivia?
 Who's early?
 Your dad? What's he doing here?
 Why did you tell me your birthday was in two weeks?
 If you and Luke are 22, that means you're old enough to merge.
 You should let me talk to him.
 What happens if you don't convince him?
 You die. You and Luke merge, Luke wins, you die.
 Do I have a choice?
 Liv's dad is in town.
 She's trying to convince him to let Jo and Kai do the merge.
 What are you talking about?
 She said no!
 He was going to kill you.
 Do you want me to go look for him?
 She's not going anywhere with you.
 She's staying with me!
 He didn't do this to you. Kai
 I'm so sorry, Liv.
 Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
 What are you doing? Liv. Come
 Why the hell would he be
 Look, Liv. I know how pissed
 Liv, stop! Like it or not,
 I told you that if anybody
 Well, first, I woke up on the
 You lied to me.
 You lied to me!
 I'm not gonna calm down. I
 Yeah. Liv used to say she hated all my ties, so I had to find a new one. (slips down the stairs)
 That depends. How many days in a row can someone drink before they're just normal?
 Back off, man. It's Caroline's mom. I'm not missing her funeral.
 I'm sober. Don't ask me to leave.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I don't even know what that is.
 
 
 And you wonder why everyone hates vampires? Look at you, messing with people for no reason! That's really brave.
 
 
 Come on. Either of you, come at me!
 Get out of here, Matt.
 I'm sorry, Matt. Come one. You can't die on me, man.
 Shut up!
 
 Elena! We need help!
 
 Sorry I'm late.
 
 Whoa  beer plus pain meds equals another trip to the hospital!
 Drinking yourself to death? That's your big plan from the future?
 
 
 
 Yeah? Well, you know what, he had it coming.
 No  that's what it is for you. Because I realized one day, doing this job might mean that I have to shoot someone. To kill them. And I don't ever want to be a werewolf again.
 
 You're not worth it.
 I got the rings!
 So... What do we do now?
 To Alaric Saltzman, who after today, will have sex with only one woman for the rest of his life
 Not that chicks are throwing themselves at an occult studies professor, but...
 Sorry, full moon tonight. Feeling extra dick-ish.
 Courtesy of Caroline.
 But, I'm bad at flowers? Yeah, I assumed you knew that.
 Caroline, why am I here?
 That's funny. You and I moved on a while ago, but getting tortured by your ex and her new boyfriend is never good for the ego.
 Whatever he is, I can't keep up.
  You're good, Care. And, if you want to make amends? Let me get the hell out of here.
 Liv, what are you doing here?
 Thanks.
 Good.
 What injury?
 Monosyllabic? That's an awful big word for a college drop-out.
 Hang on, you're mad at me?
 And instead of coming to me, you tried to kill yourself!
 That doesn't make it okay!
 I didn't do anything.
 Nothing has changed. What, because she walks in here with a pretty dress and a new haircut, I'm supposed to forget how she acted?
 You don't know about our problems.
 Do me a favor, figure out your own damn life. Let me worry about mine.
 Kai's dead, Liv. I heard the screams. Your dad, your coven, they're all in there... dying. Which means 
 I love you, Liv. You need to know that, if this has to be it for us.
 No. I'm not triggering it.
 Agh.
 I love you.
 Nooo!
 Come on, answer! Uhn, argh, ahhh! Answer, damn it!
 Matt! Listen to me. You have to tell every  ohh!
 I triggered my curse.
 Tell every vampire to steer clear of me. I don't know if I'll be able to control who I go after, and my bite will kill them!
 Ugh! Ahh! ahh!
 So, where are we in this vision of yours?
 Hello?
 
 Okay, I'm on it. But you should be running.
 You guys gotta be kidding me!
 This is still my house.
 Caroline invited me to her baby shower. Although she failed to mention the part about Mystic Falls going to crap. What the hell happened out there?
 Ahhh. And I almost have my manhood back.
 
 
 Was my town. Now it's a cesspool that's not worth getting killed over. Getting out was the best thing that ever happened to me.
 Who's that?
 Anything to avoid a guessing game about how big Caroline's belly is.
 What do you want?
 That's not an option.
 When you gave me her coffin, you made me swear to not let anybody see her. Especially you.
 You told me that's what you would say. You figured at some point, you'd get impatient, or lose your nerve, or have a really bad day. You said under no circumstance am I allowed to give her to you.
 
 
 Damon?
 Oh, what the hell is going on?
 Those aren't gonna stop me, Damon. The second I turn, you're as good as dead.
 But you're not. Why?
 
 
 Why don't you just save your ass and tell these people where Stefan is?
 Then maybe this is for the best, 'cause I'm gonna turn and tear your throat out. That way, nobody will ever have to take a bullet for you again.
 
 Why? 'Cause Elena will dump your ass?
 
 That's what I'm talking about. You open that door, and I'll kill her, too. There's always going to be something else. Your friends  my friends  they'll keep risking their lives trying to save you until they're all dead.
 
 
 Are you all right? Damon?
 Heard you haven't been yourself lately.
 Your fight's not with me, man.
 You kill me, you can say good-bye to everything. No one forgives you for this.
 You have another option. Walk away. Fight whatever it is she wants you to do and get your life back. Walk away, Damon. Think about what you want at the end of it all. Think about who you want.
 That's a lie.
 Okay, then. Do it. If this is it, if this is the way I go out, then let me go out as the face that you can never erase from your brain. The face that reminds you, to the end of time, of the moment you gave up. The moment you threw away everything you've ever wanted... to be a siren's little bitch. Or maybe this'll be the thing that wakes you up. And then maybe both our lives will be worth something at the end of it all. So, go ahead. Do it. Tear me apart. 
 Damon, wait!
 Damon, wait!
 Matt, if you got this, it means I'm dead, which sucks. It also means I need your help finding someone.
 You kill me, no one forgives you for this. Wait!
 Please leave. Or I'll make you.
 I told you to go.
 You can't save him, Bonnie. Damon killed me. That makes me the only one who can ever forgive him for that.
 Damon Salvatore is dead and if you ask me, good riddance.
