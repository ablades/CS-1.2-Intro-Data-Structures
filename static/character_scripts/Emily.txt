 It's coming.
 Please, help me.
 I'm Emily. 
 This is where it started. And this is where it has to end.
 Help me.
 I'm fine.
 I'm fine. Everything's fine.
 I must go.
 Thank you for having me. I'll take it from here.
 Back to where it all began.
 I won't let him have it. It must be destroyed.
 I won't let you do it.
 Things are different now. I need to protect my family.
 I know. I'm sorry.
 Stefan.
 These people don't deserve this. They should never have to know such evil.
 I won't let you unleash them into this world.
 To save her, I had to save them.
 With one, comes all.
 Things are different now.
 I can't free them. I won't. 
 Excuse me, Miss Katherine. Miss Pearl is here to see you.
 Which one?
 Shh, shh!
 
 Katherine had me make that for you weeks ago.
 The quarry just north of town. My brother and I brought you here last night. We found you dead in the woods.
 Not yet. You're in transition.
 You had Katherine's blood in your system when you died.
 She's been compelling you to drink it for weeks, Stefan.
 No compulsion was necessary. He drank from her willingly.
 You've transitioned.
 Katherine saved my life once. I owed her. That doesn't mean I'd wish her curse on anyone.
 That will change.
 Because even in death, your heart is pure, Stefan. I sense that about you. That will be your curse.
 Why have you come here, Stefan?
 No. Nature ensures a balance to everything.
 Perhaps it is his time to die.
 I will not give you what you want.
 Won't be long now. We've just entered the town of Mystic Falls.
 It looks like a gentleman is having problems with his carriage.
