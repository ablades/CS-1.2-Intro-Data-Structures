 Oh, come on! It took me four hours to get control of the scene from the local idiots, and now they're letting press past the tape?
 Female victim, strangled, then exsanguinated, or maybe vice versa. Now brace yourselves, it ain't pretty. We found blood on the grille, not matching her type  blood in the road over there, also not her type. Her car is dented, like she hit a deer. Maybe a mountain lion.
 Teeth marks above the collarbone, ligatures on her neck from the wire...
 Looks like candle wax.
