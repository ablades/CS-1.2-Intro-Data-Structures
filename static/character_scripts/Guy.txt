 Hey there, someone called about a flat tire?
 I'm sorry.
 Sure.
 
 Great party, right?
 To Uncle Steve!
 What's going on? Who are you?
 Hard to be happy for the guy who put my brother in a hospital?
 You're freaking enjoying this? You sick freak.
 Want to dance?
 Come on, this is a party. Have fun!
 Just dancing.
 I can't let you go. You're hot.
