 I'd gotten a message at the house saying a lady wanted to buy me a drink. Naturally, I was curious.
 Had she gotten me with that vervain injection, things would have been very different. She didn't stand a chance against me.
 In order for me to save myself and leave you, I had to shut off my humanity, damn it, so I flipped the switch, and I felt nothing  No remorse, no regret, no pain.
