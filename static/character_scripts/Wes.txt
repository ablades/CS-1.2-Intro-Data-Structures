 Hello. How are you holding up?
 My name is Dr. Wes Maxfield, and you're Joey, right? I saw your name stitched on your work shirt when I grabbed you. Apologies, but I never managed to make proper acquaintance of the janitorial staff before the hospital lost its funding. It's depressing, isn't it? The economy is no friend to medicine.
 Ironically, Joey, neither do I. (He gets an IV bag ready.)
 Well, in simple terms, I turned you into a vampire. Now, I'm gonna condition you to feed on other vampires instead of humans.
 Would you believe that I've already done it once? Now all I have to do is replicate it. Research is just money and time. I've got time. I'll find money.
 Who the hell are you?
 Still didn't catch your name.
 What do you know about my research?
 Sorry, but I'm done getting into bed with mysterious benefactors, and I don't need your protection.
 This is Aaron's bag. Where'd you get this?
 No.
 He's dead, isn't he?
 My backup.
 Good luck making new friends, Damon.
 As a man of science, I always considered magic a cheat.  Turns out, I cheat. How's the appetite?
 You're my patient zero, Damon. I couldn't let you ride off into the sunset without running a few tests.
 Well, one test. Now that youâ€™re trapped with only one source of food, how long can you go before you feed on your best friend?
 Nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Maxfield.
 Werewolf venom isn't easy to come by!
 Listen to your mother. The venom in your blood is a toxin with basic chemical properties. Once I study its makeup, I can create the antidote.
 Hello?
 How did you find me?
 There is no Augustine Society, Damon. It's just me
 Even if I did cure you of this virus, what difference does it make? So you stop feeding off your friends and you go back to feeding on innocent people. Is that really going to impress Elena Gilbert?
 I didn't do this to you! You are this. I simply held up the mirror.
