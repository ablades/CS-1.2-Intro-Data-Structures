 Hey, girls? I'm Dianne Freeman, I'm head of Campus Security. Are you okay?
 I understand Megan was your roommate. I'm so sorry you had to find her like this.
 We found a note. Apparently she was struggling with severe depression.
 Your roommate took her own life.
 We're convinced it was a suicide, but we can't seem to find her cell phone. Have you seen it?
 Okay. If it turns up, let us know?
 Ms. Gilbert?
 I'm Dianne Freeman. We met the night your roommate died.
 I didn't realize you'd be joining us.
 We just started the tea.
 Wes, are you in there? It's Dianne Freeman.
 Wes? So you are here!
 Because it's five o'clock. You missed the Whitmore party.
 That's not all you missed. Guess who I watched strut right into the front door? Elena Gilbert. Clearly not a vampire. What made you so convinced she was?
