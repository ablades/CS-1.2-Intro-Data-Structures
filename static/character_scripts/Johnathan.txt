 It's science.
 Have you told them?
 Giuseppe, we need all the men we can get.
 
 Miss Pearl. May I have a moment?
 Pearl!
 Do you see all this? The town's gone mad rounding up the demons.
 You!
 I've got another one over here!
 Arm yourselves.
 Thank you, Mr. Salvatore.
 I want to make sure the founders' archives are accurate.
 They were hardly civilians, Mr. Salvatore.
 For example?
 Certainly, Mr. Salvatore.
 With the dying embers of the fire at Fell's Church, the scourge of the vampires had passed. And though war raged all around us, our town was safe from the demons of the night...Or so we thought.
 For the monsters we drove to their fiery deaths had begat new monsters.
 Yes, Honoria...they burned in the church. We're safe now.
 Very well. I shall go too.
 I can prove there are no vampires.
 See?
 Thomas? Thomas?!
 No, stay inside! Get back in the house!
 I knew I was about to die. You can not run from a vampire. I saw the vampire who killed me. I recognized him. It was Stefan Salvatore.
