 
 
 You know, to be honest, I'm just glad the whole vampire craze is over.
 What the hell? I almost hit that guy! What's he doing in the middle of the road?
 No... no.
 What is this?
 What do you want?
 One time, I stole all my Nana's pain pills and sold them for fifty bucks a pop... While she was dying of cancer.
 What do I win?
 No, no, no...
   Oh, God, no...
 I don't want to die.
 What's down there?
 You don't have to do this. Please.
 AHHH!
 Help, help me!
