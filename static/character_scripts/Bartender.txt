 Did you say you are waiting for Jeremy-as in Jeremy Gilbert?
 He was fired last week.
 I think you've had enough.
 Okay, I'm going to call you a cab.
 
 Okay, I'll grab you another drink.
 
 
 
 
 ...What's going on?
 
 
 
 
 I'm sorry, I have no idea what that is.
 Gotcha!
 So, let me guess  old-fashioned devil and slutty angel? I love it.
 Oh, my God, Pinterest! I love Pinterest. I get half my recipes from it. I'm obsessed.
 I understand. I also understood what you were saying over there. I think I know how to help.
 Where's your girl tonight?
 Valerie? Tall, pretty, likes the drinks with the little pink umbrellas? Or do you have more than one?
 Need any help? What are you trying to write?
 "I wish that things were different, but it's safer this way. Never meant to hurt you, and I wish you all the happiness in the world." Well, sounds good to me.
 
 Here you go.
