 Damon?
 Yes, sir. What are you doing here?
 So, how do you know John Gilbert?
 I met him right after I got out of the tomb. He's been helping me out.
 Adapting. It's a whole new world...Cars, computers, match.com. There's so much to learn. He helped me get this place.
 Uh, no. No, I don't know an Isobel. I know John. He's my only real friend. He really showed me the ropes...how to use a microwave, separate my whites.
 I help keep an eye on things...You know, with the others.
 From the tomb. They're still pissed at the founding families for trying to burn them alive. I'm cool, but those tomb boys, they want revenge.
 He's just keeping an eye on them, you know? Trying to make sure they stay out of trouble.
 Heh. That's John now.
 All right. Yeah. Are you gonna answer that?
 What's going on?
 Can we have a word Miss Katherine?
 Please, Miss Katherine.
 I looked into those attacks from the other night. It wasn't vampires.
 I'm afraid you don't understand. Those folks were torn apart in ways I've never seen before.
 We'll leave town immediately. I'll tell the others.
 Salvatore, help me!
 Please! You must help me.
 
 
 News from home?
 Two weeks at home? Can you imagine? How grand. I cannot wait to see my girl Olive. She's a real peach. You have a sweetheart, Damon?
 Damon, are you certain about this?
 About the mission. These men, these deserters we are supposed to capture, they are just regular fellows who do not believe in the cause. Like me. Like you.
 Well, then how can you be fine with rounding up men just like you?
 Should I check the upstairs?
 Oh, God!, Oh, God. Damon... What have we done?
 Hi there, hero. You've been out a long time.

 These men, these deserters we are supposed to capture, aren't they are just regular fellows like you and me?
 Of course they do. They are protesting on behalf of their political beliefs.
 I'll go check the upstairs.
 But there could be people up there.

 Hi there, hero. You've been out a long time.
 Damon...
 Hi there, hero. You've been out a long time.
 What did you go and do that for?
 Hi there, hero. You've been out a long time.
 Hi there, hero. You've been out a long time.
 Damon, where are you going?
 
 
 Peek-a-boo.
 Can I get you another one, soldier?
 Are you just going to surrender your town to the enemy?
 You passed the test, yes, but you haven't completed your liberation.
 Me again.
 I can't leave until you find liberation. You're still denying your nature. You haven't let go of what's holding you back.
 A Phoenix Stone. It doesn't trap you. It frees you... to be reborn as your true self.
 You took my words to heart, did you?
 You're right. You're not doing it with me anymore.
 I promised you liberation.
 This was necessary, Damon. She held you back from being the monster you really are!
 Good morning, welcome to the Salvatore Boarding House. Do you have a reservation, ladies?
 I'm afraid so, the house is at maximum occupancy.
 Well, that's easy. He's right behind you.
 Mr. Salvatore was a bit of a hero during the war.
 You do understand I mean the Civil War?
 I'm going to have to ask you both to leave. Now!
