 Honestly, Dr. Fell, I wish it were.
 Blood bank's in the basement. One of you sweep the rooms.
 Adding a few security measures. The blood in this place has a habit of flying off the shelves.
 The Council. They've entrusted me to secure the town and unlike some of our founding families, I don't have conflicting interests.
 Alaric Saltzman told us everything, Meredith. Probably time to start looking for a new job.
 We just need to ask you a few questions about your son.
 Not anymore, you're not.
 Sorry, Liz, you're not going to work today.
 They're taking your badge. You're not fit to protect us anymore.
 On the contrary, Liz, I've already taken your deputies. We've got the entire town's supply of vervain, including the stash found in the Salvatore house. We're making our move.
 You still want to be a writer? I remember how you'd read your short stories to my daughter when you'd babysit. She still loves writing because of you.
 My deputies can watch out for us here. No vampires have been invited in. Look, Elena, I know it sounds crazy, but years ago it was your parents who were advocating having an emergency plan like this. I never thought we'd actually have to use it.
 Elena? Elena, you okay?
 Where he can't hurt you.
 Well, I know that wherever you go, Salvatore vampires seem to follow. You hungry?
 So, we'll hold Stefan until Damon comes searching for you two. We'll use Rebekah to lure her siblings back into town. You'll give us the white oak stake and then we will exterminate the entire vampire race for good.
 Is something wrong? Elena, are you okay?
 Get her!
 Let him go. The boy's innocent.
 Go away! You are not invited in and I'm not coming out!
 Folks, by now, you know that the vampires have escaped.
 And it won't be long before they retaliate against us. But fear not; 
 Hear me, loved ones. Soon you'll be free to pass through the gates. 
 Friends. We are the beginning.
