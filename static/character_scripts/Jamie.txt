 Hey, there.
 She not home. There anything I can do for you?
 I'm sorry, but you look so familiar.
 Oh...I'm Jamie. You guys wanna come inside? Right this way.
 You guys sure you don't want anything? We got fresh OJ, coconut water, some mango guava something.
 Cool.
 Oh, nah. Abby's not my mom.
 Yeah, she dated my old man back in the day. He's kind of a deadbeat, so when they broke up she took me in. Put me through school. Didn't freak out when I totalled her car. Twice.
 Hey! Everything all right out here?
 I don't think so.
 I said, I don't think so.
 You're not supposed to be here.
 What I was told. He's not supposed to be here.
 Stop moving.
 Abby hasn't called yet.
 No! Please don't do anything. Look, I don't know why I shot him, I don't know why I'm holding this gun, but if you move or do anything, I'ma shoot him again.
 A man came by earlier today, he gave me a wooden buckshot and told me if anyone got in our way, I'm supposed to shoot him.
 If Abby didn't find the location of some coffins, I'm supposed to shoot myself.
 I'm not supposed to hurt you.
 I've been pretty busy.
 
 Stay away from me!
 She's a vampire.
 She's not normal. None of this is normal!
 The guy who lives out back. You know, the one you're not related to.
 Caroline and I had a little talk.
 Maybe, but I needed it. Abby's always been there for me, now it's my turn.
 Thought I could build a fire.
 I'm so sorry, Abby. I'm sorry about everything.
 Yeah, you're doing fine. Hey – uh – thanks for helping out with Abby. Bonnie's really lucky to have a friend like you.
 Ex-boyfriend?
 That's not awkward at all.
 Oh yeah, I was just, you know...trying to make a good impression.
 Your friends seem pretty cool.
 Though you gotta admit this whole circle of people it's kinda crazy. I mean there's vampires, werewolves...ex-boyfriends with magic rings. I mean I'm just a normal guy.
 Yeah, that's true.
 She does this all the time, right?
 No problem. You know there's nothing you could have done, right?
 I should have said this before, but thank you for protecting me.
 You really are pretty amazing.
 You said your Dad's out of town, right?
 You gonna be okay by yourself?
 Bonnie, hey, hey, I think you're having a bad dream.
 Yeah.
