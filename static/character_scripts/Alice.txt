 Rose!
 He's dead!
 Thank you.
 You look really familiar. Did you know Slater?
 Doubtful. Klaus doesn't want to be pointed at.
 Are you seriously asking me that right now? I just saw my boyfriend with a stake through his heart.
 Who do you think you are?
 Someone's been here. The hard drive's completely wiped out.
 Lucky for you, Slater was paranoid. Everything's backed up on a remote server.
 Kristen Stewart. God, was he obvious.
 Slater was obsessed. Almost as much as me.
 I could call him.
 Oh, my God, I knew I recognized you.
 
 Damon Salvatore!
 No...Way!
