 Hazel. And you already did it, actually. It's my friend, Trish. The doctor said you saved her life last night.
 Can I buy you dinner? To thank you, I mean... oh God, I'm so bad at this.
 Perfect. You can pick me up at 6643 Peachtree Drive. Hopefully not in an ambulence.
 You're the anchor. If I'm here, that means I'm dead. Tell him I failed. Tell him I was trying to hide the doppelg√§nger with magic, but they found us.
 Hazel. He'll know the rest.
