 Hey Red, get me a beer.
 Who wants to know?
 I think I'll be going.
 Vampires.
 You what?
 You can't compel me, it won't work.
 I can't.
 I already told you where to find the pack. What more do you want from me?
 What are you going to do now?
 What's happening to me?
 They're dead. They're all dead.
 You said it was gonna feel better. Why doesn't it feel better?
 Vampire.
