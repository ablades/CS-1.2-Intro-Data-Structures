 That and the free Wi-Fi.
 Good. I saw you come, what are you doing here?
 Damon Salvatore. Turned 1864 in Mystic Falls by Katherine Pierce aka Katerina Petrova. So I take it I was right, what I told you about the tomb under the church was true?
 It's nice to meet you, maybe. What's going on Rose? Where's Trevor?
 And you're sure Elijah's dead?
 Trevor was a good man; he helped me with my dissertation on sexual deviance in the Baroque period. I was schooling for my Psych PhD.
 When I was turned. I have 18 degrees, 3 master's and 4 PhDs.
 Exactly, I mean, what is the point? What should I be doing with my eternity? If you have an answer, please enlighten me.
 Craigslist.
 Seriously. I respond to a personal ad to get sent to somebody who knows somebody who knows Elijah, who's dead and that's where my connection ends.
 To keep the werewolves from lifting it. If a vampire breaks the sun curse then the werewolves are stuck with the curse of the moon forever and vice versa.
 True. I've never seen one but rumor has it...
 Mystic Falls? God, I've got to visit this place. It sounds awesome.
 What do you mean?
 Well, yeah, probably, but why would you want to do that?
 You think I'm gonna help you figure out how to do something that will piss off an original? And keeping them from walking in the sun?
 Rose?
 Yes, I took off, I'm sorry, I was frigging freaked.
 Look, I want no part in any of this but I did some digging.
 You can destroy the curse but you need the moonstone.
 Can your friend get the moonstone? You need it.
 You need a witch. Get the moonstone, a witch should be able to figure out the rest. Good luck, Rose.
 Thanks, I have a degree in theater. How can you compel me? A vampire can't compel another vampire.
 What, because you're an Original?
 But that would kill me forever.
