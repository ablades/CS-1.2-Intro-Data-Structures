 My tattoo you keep asking about.
 La Marca del Cazador.
 I traced it down to the line.
 Because the mark is only visible to the Brotherhood of the Five.
 Hopefully never. If I do my job right, you will live in a world without bloodsuckers. Now, get up. I made stew.
 This should be about the right size for you.
 Don't just look at it. Prepare yourself.
 Battles are won in the mind. If you do not believe you can beat me, you never will. 
 Vampires.
 Not today, Nene. This is my burden.
 One day it may be yours but it's not today.
 
 It's not your fault, Nene.
 I know. It's his doing, not yours. Never forget that. Remember everything I taught you. Use it. Carry on my legacy. And know that I'll be with you every step of the way.
