 Let me just preface this with a big disclaimer that screams, "I should have known better."
 When Brady told me what that Tyler kid said about Mason being here for the moonstone, something clicked. There was this moment back in Florida when I suspected Mason was up to something because he was banging that hot, vampire chick Kathy and he didn't want anyone to know.
 That is the point, Jules. It's the sun and moon curse. Mason was asking me all kinds of questions about it, if it could be broken, and when that evil man-witch showed up last night, double-click. Witches, vampires, moonstone. They're putting everything in place to break the curse.
 That rock helps break the curse of the sun and the moon.
 Vampires break the curse, they're free to walk in the sunlight, but we're stuck only turning at the full moon, aka werewolf Armageddon.
 Aka werewolf domination.
 If those vamps are gearing up to break the curse, they must have also found the doppelg√§nger.
 Evil twin shadow person. We're betting Mason's hot, vampire chick Kathy knows all about it, so we need you to help us find Kathy. I I have a picture. Mason brought her to the bar once. No one liked her. She was a vampire. Bad news.
 Right right here. The girl next to Mason.
 Whew! Damn, you're strong. It took the whole syringe.
 Grab that one. He's dead.
 Morning, sunshine.
