 Doctor Martin, Jonas Martin. It's nice to meet you Bonnie Bennett. Would you like to join us?
 Louisiana.
 Bennett, huh? I knew some Bennett's when I did my residency in Massachusetts. Do you have any family from Salem?
 What do you know? Small world, right?
 Was it, really?
 Give me your hand.
 Place it here.
 Now, take my hand.
 Close your eyes. Relax your mind. And look for her.
 You saw her, didn't you?
 So how was school?
 What's wrong?
 What's going on?
 Why would you let her do that?
 Oh, God.
 Luka!
 Asleep.
 I assume he didn't live to tell about it.
 For now.
 You were successful?
 Thank you, Luka.
 Wait. There's one more thing Elijah needs us to do before we lose the full moon.
 Hello, Bonnie.
 You must be feeling very confused about us.
 I won't, but that doesn't mean we're not also looking out for you.
 You might not want to believe this, but Elijah is a man of his word. You can trust that he'll keep his end of the deal with Elena to keep you and your friends protected.
 Elijah made a promise to Elena. I'm here to see it's upheld. You need to go. Get out of here. Now.
 When your friends awaken, give them a message  They need to get the hell out of this town.
 What happened?
 What did my son tell you? What did he tell you?
 This is for your own good.

 If any harm comes to my son because of what you did, you will answer to me.
 I didn't want to but my son made a case to hear you out.
 They won't. We tried, Luka, for weeks.
 We will save her but Elijah is the answer, not Stefan and his brother. Those people, they're our enemies. They need to be dealt with.
 No. I'm going to let Elijah do it.
 Are you sure about this? I mean, I would go if I could.
 I'll stay anchored. Use all my energy. If you feel weak...
 Concentrate on Elijah. Picture him in your mind.
 What do you see?
 Good. If Elijah's there, you'll sense him. Stay focused.
 What's wrong?
 That's because it's not Elena. It's Katherine Pierce. Luka...kill her.
 She's a vampire. Find a stake and drive it through her heart.
 Luka! Luka!
 Oh, my God! Luka! Luka! I'm sorry. Please. Just wake up, son. Open your eyes.
 Victas Phesmatis Ex Eleto. Revertas Phesmatis Ut Victas. Victas Phesmatis Ex Eleto...
 Luka!
 You killed him.
 He's dead and I have no one. And now you're about to find out exactly what that feels like.
 Where is she?
 My son is dead.
 They killed Elijah and they killed Luka and my only shot at getting my daughter back is if I have Elena.
 Where is she?
 No one's getting out of here until I have her.
 Only Elijah can do that.
