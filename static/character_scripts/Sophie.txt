 Great party Caroline!
 Don't do it. Please. What if I'm wrong about her?
 Can we get someone else to do the spell?
 Because they know we're gonna get caught, Jane-Anne.
 You're Klaus.
 Did you enjoy the show?
 I see you brought friends.
 They're with Marcel. That's all that matters. I know you built this town, but this is his town now. He killed my sister because she broke the rules. So I talk to you in front of them, I'm next.
 The doors work, you know.
 I'm praying to my dead sister. Go ahead, pay your respects.
 Oh, that sounds like witch business. I'd say ask her yourself, but I guess you can't, seeing as Marcel killed her.
 
 
 Marcel may be able to keep up from practicing real magic in this town, but as keepers of the balance we still know when nature has cooked up something new. For example, I have a special gift...of sensing when a girl is pregnant.
 But werewolves can. Magic made you a vampire, but you were born a werewolf. You're the Original hybrid, the first of your kind, and this pregnancy is one of nature's loopholes.
 My sister gave her life to perform the spell she needed to confirm this pregnancy. Because of Jane-Anne's sacrifice, the lives of this girl and her baby are now controlled by us. 
 No. We can't, not yet. We have a clear plan that we need to follow, and there are rules.
 Your brother needs to cement his place in Marcel's world. His inner circle, the daywalkers  that's where we begin. They're his friends, his family. We'll be hitting him where it hurts.
