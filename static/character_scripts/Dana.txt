 Hey Matt, we need more burgers.
 With the decade dance tonight, we've been covering the sixties all week.
 Sure.
 Hey, Elena, there you are. Okay. This is going to sound freaky, but this totally hot guy just asked me to ask you if you're going to the dance tonight.
 You could at least meet him. He'll be at the dance tonight. Look for him. His name is Klaus.
 His name's Klaus. I know the name's stupid, but I swear he's hot.
 I don't know.
 But he wants to know if you'll save him the last dance. How cute is that?
 Nice outfit, Mr. Saltzman. Totally far out.
 Thanks for being here, everybody. We have a special shout-out tonight.
 This is for Elena. From Klaus.
 I'm sorry. Who are you?
