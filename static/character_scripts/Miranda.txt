 Good morning.
 Here. 
 He doesn't really care about that yet, honey, he's just trying to figure out how you feel about him right now.
 Yes you do. You're just afraid to say it.
 You're not gonna lose him, honey. You're setting him free.
 It's okay, sweetie.
 I know what you're going through. It's okay. This bridge is where your life should have ended.
 Not just once, but twice. You were ready to die, remember?
 Yes you do, honey. You know exactly what to do.
 That's right. The sun will come up and this will all be over. It's the right thing to do, Elena. You know it is. Admit it.
 Jeremy is better off without you, don't you see that?
 He'll have you. You'll be a ghost who helps him, not a monster who hurts him.
 You didn't. You were everything I ever wanted you to be. But you died, and you were supposed to stay dead.
