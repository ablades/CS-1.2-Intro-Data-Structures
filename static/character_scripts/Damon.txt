 Hello, brother.
 Wait till you see what I can do with the fog.
 Well, I couldn't miss your first day at school. Your hair's different. I like it.
 Thank God. I couldn't take another day of the nineties. That horrible grunge look? Did not suit you. Remember, Stefan, it's important to stay away from fads.
 I miss my little brother.
 I've managed to keep myself busy.
 Ah. That can be a problem...for you.
 I could ask you the same question. However, I'm fairly certain your answer can be summed up all into one little word...Elena.
 She took my breath away. Elena. She's a dead ringer for Katherine. Is it working, Stefan? Being around her, being in her world? Does it make you feel alive?
 Well, let's hope not. We both know how that ended. Tell me something, when's the last time you had something stronger than a squirrel?
 Yeah? Come on. Don't you crave a little?
 Let's do it. Together. I saw a couple girls out there. Or just, let's just cut to the chase, let's just go straight for Elena.
 Imagine what her blood tastes like!
 I can.
 I was impressed. I give it a six. Missing style, but I was pleasantly surprised. Very good with the whole face...thing. It was good.
 That's a given.
 I take that as an invitation.
 I promised you an eternity of misery, so I'm just keeping my word.
 Where's your ring? Oh, yeah, sun's coming up in a couple of hours, and, poof, ashes to ashes. Relax. It's right here.
 You should know better than to think you're stronger than me. You lost that fight when you stopped feeding on people. I wouldn't try it again. I think we woke Zach up. Sorry, Zach.
 You must be Elena. I'm Damon, Stefan's brother.
 Well, Stefan's not one to brag. Please, come. I'm sure Stefan will be along any second.
 Living room, parlor, Sotheby's auction. It's a little kitschy for my taste. I see why my brother's so smitten. It's about time. For a while there, I never thought he'd get over the last one. Nearly destroyed him.
 Yeah. Katherine, his girlfriend? Oh, you two haven't had the awkward exes conversation yet.
 Oops. Well, I'm sure it'll come up now. Or maybe he didn't want to tell you because he didn't want you to think he was on the rebound. We all know how those relationships end.
 I'm a fatalist. Hello, Stefan.
 Oh, don't be silly. You're welcome any time. Isn't she, Stefan? You know, I should break out the family photo albums or some home movies. But...I have to warn you. He wasn't always such a looker.
 Great meeting you, too, Elena.
 Great gal. Whoo. She's got spunk. You, on the other hand, look pooped. Did you over-exert yourself today? Let me guess...hospital.
 Well, were you successful? Did the powers of persuasion work? Remember, if you don't feed properly, none of those little tricks work right.
 Were you worried, Stefan? Scared we may be doomed to repeat the past? Isn't that why you play your little game, "I'm a high school human"?
 Of course you are. We both know the closest you'll ever get to humanity is when you rip it open and feed on it.
 Guess you'll just have to wait and see, won't you?
 Well, that's unfortunate.
 You really have to stop screaming.
 Shh. I got you...
 Shh, I'm not gonna drop you.
 Shh. really? Ok. Damon pulls Vicki to the edge of the roof.]
 Ugh! Relax.
 Are you sure about that? Think. Think about it. Think really hard. What attacked you?
 Who did this to you?
 Wrong!
 It was Stefan.
 Come here.
 Stefan Salvatore did this to you.
 He's a vampire. A vicious, murderous monster.
 If you couldn't fix it before, I don't know what you can do now.
 Ugh! Your choice of lifestyle has made you weak. A couple of vampire parlor tricks is nothing compared to the power that you could have, that you now need. But you can change that. Human blood gives you that.
 You have two choices. You can feed and make her forget. Or you can let her run, screaming "vampire" through the town square.
 No! I want you to remember who you are!
 Huh. Huh. Wow. Come here, sweetheart.
 It's OK.
 It's good to be home. Think I might stay a while. This town could use a bit of a wake-up call, don't you think?
 That's for me to know and for you to...dot dot dot. Give Elena my best.
 Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
 I know.
 Very much.
 Good morning.
 Don't do that. Ah, ah, ah, ah.
 This could have gone a completely different way.
 How were tryouts? Did you make the team? Very Emerson, the way you reveal your soul with so many...adjectives.
 I've come to apologize. I've been doing some thinking, some soul searching, and...I want us to start over. We need to put the past behind us. You're my little brother, and if you want to live a normal, happy human life, then I want that for you. Maybe I can do it, too. That I can learn to be a non-living living person. Maybe there's hope for both of us.
 Of course it doesn't. I saw Elena today, BTW. That means "by the way." She was at cheerleading practice. She looked so perky in her little short shorts. Just...simmer down, I didn't even go near her. I've got my own cheerleader now. Ooh, that reminds me...I gotta run. I have a date. Sweaty palms. Wish me luck.
 Hope you don't mind.
 Waiting for Elena to invite me in.
 You have a beautiful home, Elena.
 That's what I always tell him. You have to engage. You can't just sit there and wait for life to come to you. You have to go get it.
 You know, you don't seem like the cheerleader type, Elena.
 I'm sorry, Elena. I know what it's like to lose both your parents. In fact, Stefan and I have watched almost every single person we've ever cared about die.
 Oh, you know what, you're right, Stef. I'm sorry. The last thing I wanted to do was bring her up. Mmm.
 One more.
 I like you. You know how to laugh. And you make Stefan smile, which is something I haven't seen in a very long time.
 Mm-hmm.
 In a fire. Tragic fire.
 It seems like it was yesterday.
 She was beautiful. A lot like you in that department. She was also very complicated and selfish and at times not very kind, but very sexy and seductive.
 Nicely deduced. Ask Stefan. I'm sure his answer differs from mine. I'd quit cheerleading if I were you.
 Oh, I saw you at practice. You looked miserable.
 Am I wrong?
 So don't let it. Quit, move on. Problem solved. Ta-da.
 Maybe. But...seems a little unrealistic to me.
 Sure, why not?
 What are you two kids talking about?
 Hmm. Hey, you know, um, Elena and Bonnie are finishing up the dishes. Why don't you go see if you can help?
 For me?
 Go see if Elena needs help in the kitchen.
 Great.
 Sure she does. They all do. They're whatever I want them to be. They're mine for the taking.
 That's not a problem. Because...I've been invited in, and I'll come back tomorrow night and the following night and I'll do with your little cheerleader whatever I want to do. Because that is what is normal to me.
 I'm hiding from Caroline.
 I needed a break. She talks more than I can listen.
 Well, she's awfully young.
 I don't see it going anywhere in the bigger picture. I think she'd drive me crazy.
 Duly noted. I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable. That's not my intention.
 You're right. I do have other intentions, but so do you.
 Mm-hmm. I see 'em. You want me.
 I get to you. You find yourself drawn to me. You think about me even when you don't want to think about me. I bet you even dreamed about me. And right now...You want to kiss me.
 Isn't that nice? Stefan joins a team, makes a friend. It's all so, "rah, rah, go team, yeah!"
 Nice trick with Elena. Let me guess...vervain in the necklace? I admit, I was a bit surprised. It's been a while since anyone could resist my compulsion. Where'd you get it?
 Guess I could just seduce her the old-fashioned way. Or I could just...eat her.
 No?
 Who's pretending?
 Well, I'm...I'm tempted.
 If that's my humanity...then what's this?
 Anyone, anytime, any place.
 You know what's coming next.
 Bad dream? Do you know how easy it was to get into your head just now? You really need some human blood. It might even the playing field. Football reference. Too soon.
 All right, I deserved that. But I just wanted to let you know, they caught the culprit. The animal responsible for killing coach Tanner and all those people.
 It was a mountain lion. Really big one. It attacked a hunter this morning. It's all over the news. "Deadly beast captured. All's well in Mystic Falls."
 I've decided to stay a while. And I'm just having way too much fun here with you and Elena.
 Well, the vervain keeps me out of her head. Maybe that's not my target. Believe it or not, Stefan, some girls don't need my persuasion. Some girls just can't resist my good looks, my style and my charm and my unflinching ability to listen to Taylor Swift.
 This is John Varvatos, dude. Dick move.
 No yellow. Jaundice. Go for the blue.
 Well, I do. And if I'm gonna be your date—
 I went through a lot of trouble to make sure this party wasn't cancelled. It's very important I be there. Please take me.
 Not if you're wearing that dress. What's so special about this Bella girl? Edward's so whipped.
 Ah, I miss Anne Rice. She was so on it.
 Because I live in the real world, where vampires burn in the sun.
 I have a ring. It protects me. Long story.
 It's more complicated than that. You'd have to feed on my blood, then die, then feed on a human's,it's a whole ordeal. This book, by the way has it all wrong.
 Yes, I can be sweet.
 Mm-hmm. But not yet.
 Because there's something I need you to do for me.
 How good are you at getting this little nose where it doesn't belong?
 Mmm.
 Just going through Stefan's homework. Boy, this country sure has dumbed down in the last hundred years. Why he wants to go to high school is beyond me. I mean, in the seventies, he went Ivy League. Harvard, I understood. Actually, no. I didn't get that either. Go ahead, purge. Get it out. What's on your mind?
 To spend time with you, Zach. Family's important.
 You are in no position to question me.
 This is not upset, Zach.
 Having a family moment, Stefan. Spending some quality time.
 Do they still wear ties at this thing?
 It's only fitting. We were at the very first one, remember?
 So you should stay here. I'll see to it Elena has a good time. My goodness, I've driven you to drink.
 Go about living my life. See, therein lies your eternal struggle. You're dead, dude. Get over it. What do you think?
 It's cool not growing old. I like being the eternal stud.
 You cracked a funny, Stefan. I should have a drink to celebrate. 1864. You and Katherine were the perfect couple. It was hell watching you dance with her.
 I remember. I left the party early, I was waiting for her. The night you dropped her off, I was waiting just inside. You were such a gentleman, gave her a kiss on the cheek. And what she really wanted was...Oh, well. Here's to history repeating itself, huh?
 I admire your effort, Stefan. Pouring yourself a drink then spiking the bottle with vervain. I'm not some drunk sorority chick. You can't roofie me. But I can't help but feel a little used. I thought we were having a moment. I have to go to the party angry. Who knows what I'll do?
 Lovely to meet you. I've been looking forward to this party for quite a while.
 Let's get a drink.
 The original Salvatore brothers. Our ancestors. Tragic story, actually.
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh, sure he does. You should see him. Waltz, the jitterbug, the moonwalk. He does it all.
 I want to apologize to you for being such a world-class jerk the other night when I tried to kiss you. There's no excuse. My therapist says I'm...Acting out, trying to punish Stefan.
 It's all in the past. I don't even want to bring it up. Let's just say that the men in the Salvatore family have been cursed with sibling rivalry. And it all started with the original Salvatore brothers.
 The Salvatore name was practically royalty in this town. Until the war. There was a battle here—
 Right.
 What the history books left out was the people that were killed. They weren't there by accident. They were believed to be union sympathizers. So some of the founders on the confederacy side back then wanted them rounded up and burned alive. Stefan and Damon had someone they loved very much in that church. And when they went to rescue them, they were shot. Murdered in cold blood.
 A woman, I guess. Doesn't it always come down to the love of a woman?
 I hope so, too.
 What'd we miss?
 No, thanks, I'll pass.
 Don't talk, please.
 Ah. Looking for you.
 Okay, just a minute. Stand right...there.
 A very important crystal.
 Because I put it there.
 A long time ago. Tonight, I'm taking it back, thanks to you.
 Never you mind.
 It's not stealing if it's mine. Come on.
 You make me crazy, you know that? It's okay. I forgive you.
 Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. Unfortunately...I am so over you now.
 What the hell?
 Where is my ring?
 How long have I been here?
 What are you doing?
 You know what will happen if I don't...feed on blood.
 So what, you're just going to leave me in the basement, forever?
 I'm stronger than you think.
 So it was your vervain. Good for you. Good for you. Family only runs so deep.
 I don't guess I could talk you into bringing me a rabbit or something? I'd settle for Stefan's diet at this point.
 You succeeded, Zach. I'm shutting down. You're like your grandfather. He didn't like it when I came to visit, either.
 Someone had to mow the lawn.
 Unlock it. Unlock the door, Zach.
 Caroline. Caroline.
 Caroline.
 Caroline.
 I bet you're feeling pretty good about yourself, aren't you?
 You won. You got the bad guy. Now nothing could come between you and Elena. Except the truth. The lies will catch up to you, Stefan. As long as you keep lying to yourself about what you are.
 Caroline. Caroline, help me. Caroline. Help me. Help me.
 Caroline, help me. Caroline. Help me.
 Because I wanted you to. Very, very badly. Let me out of here. Please.
 You liked it. Remember?
 You remember what I want you to remember. And now that the vervain has passed out of your system, you won't remember what you're about to do.
 You're gonna open the door. You're gonna open the door.
 Come here. Come here.
 Come closer. I have something...that I have to tell you.
 I want my ring.
 I'm at the sizzler. I had the buffet. Where's my ring?
 No, what have you done? You're the one that locked me in the basement and starved me, so whatever I've done, whoever I've sucked dry is on you, buddy.
 I know how to cover my tracks, Stefan. Where's my ring?
 ...Ah, you almost got me. Where is it?
 What, did you FedEx it to Rome?! Where is it? I want my ring, Stefan, or my next stop's Elena's.
 Don't give me another reason to rip you apart.
 Just get it.
 You just don't wanna die, do you?
 Where are you, Stefan? I'm trapped at the house, and I'm getting really bored and really impatient, and I don't do bored and impatient. Bring me my ring. Damn it.
 Aw, don't get blood on the couch!
 Please? I got you good, didn't I?
 Well, you're not gonna be any fun today. I'm so gonna regret this.
 Drink up. Drink it up. Don't drip. There you go. Good girl. That's it.
 Camp outside Atlanta. One of the officers picked it up at Harvard. Catch.
 Why are you just standing there? That is a girl who clearly wants to be chased. If you don't do it, I will.
 What would you like it to be?
 I was simply having too much fun to return to battle.
 How's that, miss Katherine?
 Some blood. You loved it.
 We met in the woods. You were drunk. I attacked you. Then I killed all of your friends and brought you here, gave you same blood. You loved it. And now we're gonna party till the sun goes down.
 Only if I can.
 Jeremy, huh? Elena's brother?
 I know.
 I've been in love. It's painful and pointless and overrated.
 No more talking. Let's dance.
 Your life is so pathetic.
 You are so damaged.
 I mean, you don't have one hint of self-esteem.
 I think I know what can help you.
 Death.
 Then I killed you.
 You're dead.
 Yeah, well, let's not make a big deal out of it. You drank my blood, I killed you, and now you have to feed in order to complete the process.
 You don't wanna be out there all alone. You're about to get really freaky.
 You're gonna start craving blood, and until you get it, you're gonna feel very out of it. You have to be careful.
 See? you're already starting to fall apart.
 Ok, fine. I'm just warning you. Actually, you know what? You should go. In fact, if I were you, I would stop by your boyfriend Jeremy's house.
 Bye. Tell Elena I said hi and if you see Stefan, tell him to call me.
 You're afraid of me. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess. Stefan finally 'fessed up.
 Hey, there's no need to be rude. I'm just looking for Stefan. May I come in? Oh, wait. Of course I can. I've been invited. We can cut to the chase if you want. I'm not gonna kill you right now. That wouldn't serve my greater agenda. So...Where's Stefan?
 Don't look at me with those judgey little eyes. Girl's gonna thank me for what I did to her.
 Mmm. Got the whole life story, huh?
 Oh, I doubt that. Tell my brother I'm looking for him. Oh, tip for later, be careful who you invite in the house.
 It's wood. They know. If anyone's gonna kill you, it's gonna be me. My ring.
 Oops.
 You don't talk.
 "Dude"? Really? "Dude"?
 Oh come on. Who's gonna miss this idiot?
 Forget what you saw here tonight. None of us were here.
 There's nothin' about that Logan guy I killed in here. Not a word. Someone's covering it up.
 This is a very special, very old compass. What was Logan Fell doing with it? Aren't you curious?
 We should all be worried.
 Heh. Don't lie to the girl. It's so not what you're craving, but it'll do in a pinch, right, Stef?
 Yeah, what is it? Is it a skunk? Saint Bernard? Bambi?
 She's new. She needs people blood. She can't sustain on that stuff.
 Yeah.
 You don't have to kill to feed. Just find someone really tasty and then erase their memory after wards. It's so easy.
 Don't listen to him. He walks on a moral plane way out of our eye line. I say snatch, eat, erase.
 Okay, count deepak. I am outta here.
 Yep!
 And good morning to you, little miss " I'm on a mission".
 And how can you be so brave and stupid to call a vampire arrogant and glib?
 Yes, you would.
 Yet.
 He's upstairs singing "The rain in Spain". Knock yourself out.
 What are you doing?
 I was...bored.
 It's one of the pitfalls of eternity.
 That'll ease up. You've just been cooped up all day. Let's go.
 Your life was pathetic. Your afterlife doesn't have to be.
 She's been cooped up in your room all day. She's not Anne Frank.
 If you're gonna teach her. Teach her. Show her what it's all about.
 I'm not takin' her to Disneyland. We're going in the front yard. Come on.
 She's a vampire Stefan, she should know the perks.
 Like....
 Come on Vicki, live a little. No pun intended.
 Uh...my bad.
 Let me guess. Daisy Buchanan. I love a good "gatsby" look.
 Ah, she had a schoolgirl crush on me but...It was cute but I had to let her down easy.
 Ah, you remember?
 Salvatore.
 Mm hmm.
 Zach's my uncle. How do you know Zach?
 Yeah. I think there's something in my eye.
 Yes, they were. I wasn't aware that Zach was a member. I just recently moved back home and haven't really had a chance to meet many of his friends.
 Zach went out of town for a bit. But if it's about the Vervain...
 Well, I'm a Salvatore. Of course I do.
 Hmm. Cheers.
 So you need vervain?
 Well, I talk to him all the time. So why don't I just ask him?
 Mmm. How much do you need? I mean, how many people, you think?
 Of course.
 The council?
 Well, are you happy with your husband?
 You flirted with me first.
 Let me escort you to the school. It's not safe out there alone. I mean, I've seen 10 vampires tonight.
 How's that search goin'?
 Oh.
 Okay.
 So where...where'd Caroline run off to?
 Oh, Bonnie. So loyal.
 Where'd you get that?
 Caroline. You know that's mine, don't you?
 Funny. I'd like it back, please.
 Or I could just take it right now.
 What?
 You should go. I got this.
 You confuse me for someone with remorse.
 None of this matters to me. None of it.
 You need to leave. Your wounds are bleeding and you need to leave.
 I can do it. If this is what you want...I'll do it.
 What do you want him to know?
 It's done.
 Boo.
 Hello Lexi. What an unexpected surprise.
 How long are you here for?
 Oh, you mean you didn't come all this way to see me?
 Why are you so mean to me?
 Because I'm a vampire.
 Teach me to be good.
 
 Yeah.
 Sure.
 Yes he is. But I spoke with Zach. He filled me in and asked if I could bring this to you.
 That's all we have at the moment, I hope it's enough.
 And your deputies, of course right? Are we any closer?
 So is that even possible?
 Hm. So what's the next step?
 And I, of course, will do anything I can to help.
 Much better. You wanna throw a party here at the grill tonight.
 Because then Stefan and his BFF won't come. I need a lot of people. Big crowd. Invite everyone.
 Because you're gonna help me solve this town's little vampire problem. And I want my crystal back.
 I know that. Get it from her.
 Funny you should ask.
 There's a party at the grill. You'll love it. Banquettes, Tacky wait staff, All of Stefan's friends.
 Well, It's not for you. It's a party party. No one's gonna know it's your birthday. Caroline's throwing it.
 We're friends it's cool. It's important for the town to see us out and about like normal folk. We need to blend. 
 Glad you thought of it.
 Do you have my crystal?
 Then I'm not having a good time.
 Where's my brother?
 Buy you a— 
 Where is it?
 So rip it off her neck.
 Damn it! Why does it do that? I need that crystal.
 No, you are the only stupid thing here. And shallow. And useless. 
 Stefan smiles. Alert the media.
 Oh, you're right. Poor Stefan persecuted throughout eternity by his depraved brother; does it get tiring being so righteous?
 Ouch! Well, consider this psychopath's feelings get hurt.
 I'm gonna need a less vague question.
 You asked me to take away his memory of fangs and all the bad stuff. You wanted me to take away his suffering.
 Elena, I took away the suffering.
 Have you tried The Brittle. It wins award.
 Okay, I have a diabolical master plan.
 If I told you it wouldn't be very diabolical, now would it?
 What are you doing?!
 
 You okay?
 All right.
 It just...reflex. I guess the adrenaline kicked in.
 Yeah call a lucky break with that witness, without her you wouldn't have been able to ID the vampire.
 You're welcome.
 Told you I'd take care of it.
 Come on, I did this for you. To get them off our trail.
 
 Rise and shine! 
 Peace offering. Come on, you need it for blood circulation. Does dead flesh good! 
 I got the town off our back. It was for the greater good, but I'm sorry. And, to prove it, I'm not gonna feed on a human. 
 Are you mimicking me?
 
 Yeah. I'm done. "That's just like you, Damon. Always have to have the last word."
 Okay, it's your last chance.
 Oh no, Don't do that. Let's stay on point. I want my necklace.
 I can't take it, but you can give it to me. I'm trying to help you, here.
 You do want my help, and you don't even know it. You know why, you little witch? 'Cause you've stumbled into something you need to stumble out of.
 Don't! No threats. Look, A, you hurt me last time. B, I wish you no harm. Believe it or not, Bonnie, I wanna protect you. Let me help you get Emily off your back.
 I know a lot of things, and I know more about that crystal than you do, and I know that she's using it to creep inside of you. See how scared you are? And, you should be, because I will get that crystal, even if I have to wait for Emily to give it to me herself. So, next time she comes out to play, you tell her that a deal's a deal.
 I don't, Damon. I can't trust you to be a nice guy. You kill everybody, and you're so mean. You're so mean, and...
 I'm on edge. Crash diet. You know, I'm trying to keep a low profile.
 I'll manage. You don't have to keep an eye on me.
 So, why are you here?
 Lucky shot.
 You're beating me.
 I'm onto you. Reverse psychology. It's a little transparent, but I admire the effort.
 Seriously, what game do you think you're playing?
 Touché.
 What are we doin' here?
 Don't forget who taught you how to play this game.
 
 I'm impressed Stefan. Fun with booze and darts, sentimental with football, and now? Starry night. What do you want, Stefan?
 
 
 How do you know it was Katherine's? Emily gave it to her on her last night. I was with her, and you weren't.
 She didn't tell you?
 I could rip your heart out and not think twice about it.
 I have a bigger surprise, Stefan. 
 Before Katherine and the others were killed in the church, you remember what it was like in this town?
 Townspeople were killing vampires one by one. When they came for Katherine, I went straight to Emily, said,"I'll do anything. Name your price. Just protect her." She did.
 She did some kind of spell with the crystal. And while the church was burning, and we thought Katherine was burning in it, she wasn't.
 There's a tomb underneath the church. The spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.
 If that's what you wanna call it. She's been trapped in a mystical holding cell for the last century and a half, but you're an expert on starving a vampire, so how do you think she's doing, Stefan? Did you know that witches can use celestial events to draw energy into their magic? Me either. But in order to give the crystal its power, Emily used the comet that was passing overhead. And, in order for that crystal to work again...
 Downside? Long time in between comets. And, a couple of hiccups along the way with the crystal, but the comet passed, and I got the crystal. And then Caroline got the crystal, and now Bonnie has the crystal, and here we are.
 Because she knew they were gonna come for her, too, and she made me promise that her lineage would survive.
 It's the only thing keeping me from ripping that little Bonnie girl's throat out to get my crystal back. Oh well, a deal's a deal. So...you wanna go throw some more?
 Hello Emily. You look different.
 We had a deal.
 I protected your family. You owe me.
 You're about to be a lot more than that.
 It hurts. This is why I feed on people.
 Emily. I swear to God, I'll make you regret this.
 What does it matter?
 I don't care about them. I just want Katherine.
 The two aren't mutually exclusive.
 Why not? They killed 27 people, and they called it a war battle. They deserve whatever they get.
 This town deserves this.
 There is nothing innocent about these people, and don't think for a second it won't happen again. They already know too much, and they'll burn your little grandwitch right next to us when they find out. Trust me.
 Don't do this.
 No! No please.
 No!
 Katherine never compelled me. I knew everything. Every step of the way. It was real for me. I'll leave now.
 I don’t know. London, maybe. See some friends.
 You’re right, Stefan. I only have you. 
 
 Sheriff. What a surprise.
 Come in.
 Um, I hope you understand the secrecy. Stefan doesn’t know about this yet and I’d like to keep it that way.
 So, what do you need?
 I’m sorry. I don’t understand. I thought we solved that problem when I 
 So, uh, what do we do?
 Thank you for stopping by.
 Absolutely.
 Get off of me. 
 Obviously not.
 Ah, what do we care? We’re leaving anyway, right?
 Let the adults handle this, Stefan.
 Just wait. I’ll be there in minute.
 You can give me that.
 Because I interfere with the signal.
 You do that. 
 Bye.
 You don’t wanna do this, trust me.
 For what?
 I killed you. I didn’t turn you.
 
 It happens. 
 
 You have to have vampire blood in your system when you die. I didn’t do that. Some other vampire found you, gave you their blood.
 That’s what I wanna know.
 
 Ah, 
 It could be worse.
 Welcome to the club.
 Wait a minute. Cops only found one body.
 You're kidding.
 Well, you probably love her. Anything you felt before will be magnified now. You're gonna have to learn how to control that.
 The journals?
 Who turned you?
 Who turned you?
 Then you'll never know. 
 It seems we're at a bit of an impasse then, doesn’t it?
 Logan Fell is a vampire and when I find him again, I’m gonna destroy him limb by limb.
 No, I'm not ok. I was ambushed. I was shot. 
 You’re kidding me. Why the hell is he there?
 Well, I’ll be right there.
 Payback's a bitch, isn't it? 
 Gonna try this one more time. 
 
 I don't side with anyone. You pissed me off. I want you dead. Who turned you?
 Oh, well. You're screwed.
 You’re lying.
 If you're lying to me, I will end you.
 Take me down. Make it look real. Make it look real!
 She’s ok. My brother's taken her home. I’m sorry, Sheriff. I just wasn’t strong enough.
 Hello.
 Um, not following.
 What?
 How ya doing in there?
 You look stuck.
 Shh Shh Shh. Let me get you out of there. I want you to put your hands on the roof. Just like that. You ready? 1, 2, 3. 
 Whoa, you're fading fast, Elena. Elena, look at me. 
 What?
 Upsy-daisy.
 Morning.
 Georgia.
 Seriously, we're...we're in Georgia. How ya feeling?
 There's no broken bones. I checked.
 That's what I would like to know.
 Oh you were so much more fun when you were asleep.
 
 Oh come on. Look. We've already come this far...
 That's a little melodramatic, don't you think?
 Well, you're IN Georgia. Without your magical little necklace, I might add. I can very easily make you...agreeable.
 Mmm. It's your boyfriend. I'll take it. 
 Elena? She's right here. And, yes, she's fine.
 He wants to talk to you.
 Yeah. I don't...I don't really think she wants to talk to you right now.
 
 We're almost there.
 A little place right outside of Atlanta. Oh, come on, Elena. You don't wanna go back right now. Do you? What's the rush? Time-out. Trust me. Your problems are still going to be there when you get home. Look. Step away from your life for five minutes. Five minutes!
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Get in the car. Come on.
 I pulled it off to the side of the road. I don't think anyone will bother it.
 From what I could tell, yeah...
 If I've never met him, I wouldn't know him. I mean, it's not like we all hang out together at the Vamp Bar & Grill.
 Sure they will.
 
 
 
 Well, you help me get into that tomb, and we'll find out.
 There's a little problem with number two. I don't have the crystal.
 What about a new spell with a new crystal that overrides Emily's spell?
 You okay?
 Vampires can't procreate. 
 Kinda creepy if you ask me. 
 
 Thank you.
 
 Sorry I can't unhinge my jaw like a snake to consume alcohol.
 Hmm. She was right back there.
 What the hell?!
 Who are you?
 Nothing.
 Ahhhhh.
 
 No kiss?
 And you're telling me this why?
 
 Where is this book?
 You have no idea.
 And I believe you. My dear, sweet Bree. That's why I'm almost sorry.
 Well, you're not the worst company in the world, Elena. You should give yourself more credit!
 You were there in the road, all damsel-in-distress-like. And, I knew it would piss off Stefan. And...you're not the worst company in the world, Elena.
 You did okay.
 I know.
 Bourbon.
 Not your concern.
 
 
 You're pathetic when you're fishing.
 Don't you have school?
 I think we need a fresh start.
 But I didn't, and if I wanted to, I would have. Does that not count for anything?
 Yeah, we're fine.
 
 And why would I want it?
 I'm not surprised. Man could barely spell his own name.
 You? Help me? Aw, I don't know. Seems a little unnatural.
 What about the other 26 vampires?
 What are you doin'? Hmm? What's your angle?
 Why would I trust you?
 Stefan's phone. How may I help you?
 He's on his way to you. Forgot his phone.
 You're welcome.
 How did he get in?
 Well, he gets points for that. Did he say what he wanted?
 No. 
 We don't know.
 Then we go get him tonight. 
 Let your boyfriend take you to the dance. We'll see who shows up.
 Till we get him, this house isn't safe. For anyone who lives in it. It's worth a shot.
 Hi, Bonnie. Wanna dance?
 Please give me another chance.
 I don't know.
 I was perfectly polite. Elena...Would you like to dance?
 Ah, the, uh, cursed faculty position.
 Damon. Salvatore.
 He's my little brother. I'm his legal guardian, hence the chaperoning.
 Well, his attendance record's a little spotty. Family drama.
 Mm, it's just the two of us now.
 On and off. Travel a bit.
 You, too.
 Hey, dickhead. 
 You knew Katherine?
 Tell me how to get in the tomb. Hmm?
 Where is it?
 Who else is there?
 He had to die.
 What were you doing?
 Why are you in Mystic Falls?
 Do you know what I am?
 Is everything you're telling me the truth?
 Then forget we had this conversation.
 There's no way that idiot was workin' alone.
 Look at you puttin' the pieces together. Good for you. I was half-right. Well, it's out there now. Let the games begin.
 Yeah, with some hidden caveats, no doubt.
 If I agree?
 Why should I trust you?
 No, that's not gonna cut it.
 Ok.
 What happens to the bodies?
 
 Sorry.
 Rise and shine, sleepyheads.
 Oh, stop being smutty.
 If I see something I haven't seen before, I'll throw a dollar at it. Now listen, we have some very important business to discuss.
 Well, we have lots to do, now that we're all friends and working toward a common goal.
 So, in order to open the tomb, we need to find the journal to get the grimoire to undo the spells. First things first-since you are Elena Gilbert, you're on journal duty.
 Well, Stefan's helping, and you've taken up residence in Stefan's bed, ergo...
 Good.
 In lieu of any other options.
 It's a witch's cookbook.
 Yeah. Cookbook.
 And I don't like that disadvantage, so...
 Make me.
 Hmm, no.
 Well, I never asked for your respect.
 You're being cryptic now, father. Why don't you just say the word?
 My father never approved of anyone I dated, which only made me want them more. Of course. What about you?
 They ever find him? Or is he still missing?
 Hello, Elena.
 Is Stefan with you?
 Whoa. Mmm.
 Do what?
 Well, yeah, I was deliberately trying to get to the sink.
 Speaking of Stefan, where is he? He's missing family night, which I am enjoying immensely.
 Is it real?
 This renewed sense of brotherhood. 
 Can I trust him?
 I'm not compelling you. I just want you to answer me. Honestly.
 She's good. I almost believe she genuinely likes him.
 
 Have you gone mad? No, no, father would drive the stake in her himself!
 No, no, not with this. Please, promise me you won't tell him, Stefan.
 There was a time when I trusted him more than anyone.
 Are you lecturing me?
 I just want her back. I'm sure you can understand that.
 Then you understand what I will do if anyone gets in my way.
 I'm a fast learner. Quick reflexes.
 Who are you dodging?
 Is she hot?
 Hot trumps weird, trust me.
 Well?
 Who took it?
 You know what, it's that teacher. There's something really off about him.
 Who else knew it was there?
 Why, what's the big deal?
 So....I heard you found a really cool journal from back in the day. Who else did you show it to?
 Don't ask questions, just spill.
 The hot, weird one?
 That's what I want to find out.
 How do you know her?
 Perfect. I'll drive. Come on.
 How can you be so calm? They're getting closer to you every day.
 I'd sooner die.
 
 Damn. You're strong for a little thing.
 How long have you been here?
 How did you know about the spell?
 So if you've been here the whole time, then why are we just crossing paths right now?
 Like Logan Fell? Oh, yeah, thanks for that, by the way. Little bastard shot me.
 Mm-hmm.
 What'd you want with the Fell journal?
 Why would I help you?
 Hmm. 
 Well, what do you know?
 This is an interesting turn of events.
 So am I. For thinking for even a second that I could trust you.
 Of course I was going to do it by myself, because the only one I can count on is me! You made sure of that many years ago, Stefan. But you...
 You had me fooled.
 So what are you going to do now? Because if you try and destroy that, I'll rip her heart out.
 I can do one better.
 Give me the book, Stefan, or I'm snapping her neck. And you and I will have a vampire girlfriend.
 The book!
 Problem is, I no longer trust that you'll give it back!
 No! Don't take her!
 Then let me be killed!
 Help me!? Don't you think that you've done enough? You promised you wouldn't tell him!
 You did this. This is your fault.
 Yeah, I got that from your 600 voice mails.
 Well, then at least you know you'll see her again.
 
 Apology accepted.
 Huh.
 I mean this sincerely. 
 Hi there. I'm, uh, looking for Bonnie.
 Oh, well do you know when she-
 
 What'd I do?
 Step outside and say that.
 Go ahead. Grovel again. Oh, wait no...I don't care.
 Got a hot date or are you just plan on nabbing the entire Gilbert family?
 I told you. I work alone.
 Stefan will come after you, you know that. For messing with Elena.
 When do you want to do this?
 I'm gonna have to change the locks. You stage a jailbreak?
 Ah, brother. Ever the white knight.
 I doubt that.
 Well, at least you're honest.
 Not interested.
 
 Who's to say I didn't?
 
 You know Anna won't stop, by the way, no matter what I do.
 I didn't compel you in Atlanta because we were having fun. I wanted it to be real. I'm trusting you. Don't make me regret it.
 Your hope, not mine.
 Long story, no time to tell it.
 Sure you were.
 Matt, there's a reason we haven't met. You and I are going that way.
 Brother. Witches.
 It's for Katherine. Gotta have something to get her going. Unless your girl's offering a vein to tap. 
 Hmm.
 What are they saying?
 
 You ready?
 
 You'll bring the walls down if I don't. You think I trust you?
 May I?
 They can sense you. Now, where is she?
 She's not here.
 She's not here.
 She's not here!
 It doesn't make sense. They locked her inside.
 How could she not be in here?
 No!
 You knew Katherine wasn't in there.
 Why do you get a happy ending?
 Why do you get it and I don't?
 
 No! Buzzkill Bob.
 Greetings.
 Yeah.
 Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of them. They're really good at keeping secrets.
 You're worried about me. That's nice. Don't be. There's no need. I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be? I spent the last 145 years with one goal  get in that tomb. I succeeded. Granted, Katherine wasn't in there to be rescued, but why dwell? You know, it's so liberating not having a master plan, because I can do whatever the hell I want.
 Relax. I haven't killed anyone in  
 Will end up in their dorm with headaches, think they blacked out. Business as usual. Predictable you didn't pull me over here for a pep talk. So drink up. 
 You wanna discuss the women in my past right now? Seriously?
 What's your point?
 Oh, it's like a needle in a haystack, Stefan.
 Nothing is important, not anymore.
 Great chat. I have to go and exploit some women in the name of grief, which I'm sure you understand. "TTFN", said the Tri-Delt. Heh.
 Bourbon.
 Behold the teacher. Don't you have some papers to grade?
 Well, most things in life are. Sober's depressing.
 You say that like you know me.
 Not likely.
 It's all the rage.
 You ever been in love?
 Have you ever been so bent on someone, just to have your heart ripped out by them?
 Right. Gay husband. 
 
 Is this what you do when there's no, um...
 You know, a room full of women clamoring to win a date with me. Sounds tasty.
 One thing. Can you get information on someone for me? Alaric Saltzman, the history teacher. There's just something a little off about him, and I just   I just wanna make sure that the high school did their homework on this guy.
 Thanks.
 Better. Me.
 Dashing? Gorgeous? Irresistible?
 No reason why. Do you know that I am one of Mystic Falls' most eligible bachelors?
 Yep.
 Never better. Yep.
 What can I do for you? I'm a barrel of favors today. It's my newfound purpose—how can I help people?
 Help a guy out, will you? Can't get this.
 Eccch. Who cares?
 She left you. She sucks.
 Uhh. I need a bigger jacket. Wow. You know, an occasional sorority girl might, um, you know, help fill you out a little bit.
 Where'd our girlfriend go?
 Who wants to know?
 Who else wants to know?
 Sorry. Don't know her.
 Hey, are you coming? The Real Housewives of Mystic Falls await.
 I've got the big date planned. It's a romantic dinner, secluded spot somewhere woodsy.
 Well, you are in charge. You could always rig it.
 Mmm. Pardon me.
 How's it look?
 North Carolina? She have a name?
 Isobel.
 Well, I'm tough to fit on a card.
 Oh, yeah. L.A., New York. Couple of years ago, I was in North Carolina. Near the Duke campus, actually. I think—I think Alaric went to school there. Didn't you, Ric?
 Yeah, 'cause I  I know your wife did.
 I had a drink with her once. She was—she was a great girl. I ever tell you that? Cause she was   Delicious. Mmm! Mmm mmm mmm.
 Whoa. Easy there. Buy a ticket like everyone else.
 What?
 Am I missing something here?
 Mm-hm.
 Are you really this stupid?
 Guess so.
 You gonna put down the stake?
 Wow. That's courage.
 You want me to tell you I killed her? Would that make you happy? Because I think you know what happened.
 Yeah, I did, and I wasn't lying. She was delicious.
 Oh, come on. What do you think happened? Not an inkling? Never considered the possibility?
 I turned her.
 She came to me. All pathetic, looking for vampires. There was something about her, something I liked. There was something special.
 No, I slept with her because I liked her. I turned her because she begged me to. Yeah. But you knew that, too, didn't you? Hmm. I guess she wasn't happy at home, wasn't happy with life in general, wasn't happy with you.
 Ah, this is a shame. We're kindred spirits, abandoned by the women we love. Unrequited love sucks.
 Sounds like I got a lung. Which means I get to sit here and watch you die.
 Do what? He attacked me.
 All I did was tell him the truth. His wife didn't want him anymore. It's not my fault he couldn't handle it.
 I'm handling it fine. You know what? Isobel came to me. She found me. And if she's related to Elena, that means she's related to Katherine. Maybe Katherine sent her to me.
 Can't be a coincidence Isobel sought me out. Uh-uh. Can't. 
 Ever hear of knocking?
 I kill them.
 Sure.
 All 25 vampires?
 How did they get out of the tomb?
 That's ridiculous.
 What exactly are you trying to achieve?
 What, are you crazy? It was 1864. Wake up woman. The world has moved on.
 I want nothing.
 You wouldn't even know where she was. You've been under the ground for the last century and a half.
 I no longer have any desire to see Katherine ever again. And there's no way in hell I'm gonna play the role of your little minion.
 My eyes were a little sensitive today.
 On the contrary, I'm very old.
 Bourbon, neat.
 Yeah. Where did you go?
 I've been there.
 It's more like nursing my wounds. And you?
 Well, that's not very nice.
 That's not very nice either.
 Yes it does.
 Great for the soul.
 Can't wait.
 You'd be surprised. My primary reason for existence has abandoned me and after today's events, the remains of the shakey ground that I walk on are about to go kaboom. Let's get hammered.
 So, the thing about cherries, you have to...
 Oh my goodness.
 That's amazing, you were fast.
 I'm going to...going to do this.
 Don't look at me like that.
 Save the lecture. Look...
 Damn it.
 Yeah...About that.
 I say we go to Pearl's, bust down the door, and annihilate the idiot that attacked us last night.
 It was more like a helpful exchange of information. And it's not like I had a choice. She's...scary. Besides, she's gonna help me get Katherine back.
 You don't have to be snarky about it.
 How long are you going to blame me for turning your birth mother into a vampire?
 Ouch.
 Hunting party?
 I've got two liters of soccer mom in the fridge. No?
 All right. Give my regards to the squirrels.
 You're ignoring me.
 Is Stefan here?
 He went out in the woods and didn't come back. I can't get him on his phone. I figured he was here with you.
 You're not going to like what I'm thinking.
 Pearl! Open this door. I swear to God I'll bust through and rip your head off.
 Where's my brother?
 You're dead.
 They have him. I can't get in.
 Because the woman who owns the house is compelled to not let me in.
 You're not going in there.
 You're not going in there.
 Revenge. They want revenge.
 I know.
 I know. Elena, I know. But I don't know how to get him out.
 Well, don't you look...alive?
 Oh, I can hurt you, all right.
 But your life is valuable. Yours, on the other hand is...
 Let me recap...You tried to kill me. I defended myself. You died. Then according to my brother, your ring brought you back to life. Am I leaving anything out?
 That's a shame. Because the woman in charge of the crowd can help you find your wife.
 Am I? Why don't you ask her for yourself? Coward. Come on, Elena.
 Teacher by day, vampire hunter by night.
 Just get me in. I'll get Stefan out.
 Well, I'll be a little stealthier than that, hopefully.
 No. No. No. No. No way.
 You'll get yourself killed. You're not going in there.
 So, when you get me in, get out as quickly as you can. I know how to sneak around where they can't hear me. You'll basically just be in the way.
 Fine. Elena, you can drive the getaway car. You're not going in the house.
 Oh, I understand. I understand. He's the reason you live. His love lifts you up where you belong. I get it.
 I can't protect you, Elena. I don't know how many vampires there are in there. That's how long it takes you to get your head ripped off. I have to be able to get in and get out. I can't be distracted with your safety. Or this will end up a bloodbath that none of us walk away from...Including Stefan. I know. I get it. I understand.
 Get her out of the house. Now! Miss Gibbons, tell me the truth. Are you married?
 Parents, children, anyone else who lives on this property?
 No? Good.
 It doesn't work that way...
 And I'm not! So, I don't care. Now, get out of here. And get rid of the body!
 Are you insane?
 She was supposed to stay in the car.
 Whatever. Let's get you down.
 Elena, pull that.
 All right, let's go. Clothes on.
 What? Guys, come on. We have to get out of here.
 Come on, we gotta go.
 Can you get him in the car?
 All right, go.
 You rescue, I'll distract. Go.
 I'm going after Frederick!
 Frederick's gone.
 I'm gonna kill him.
 How many of those vervain darts do you have left?
 Not gonna be enough.
 Yep.
 Me? Your merry little band of vampires spent the day torturing my brother.
 Our little arrangement doesn't work unless you learn to control them.
 Well, it did. If I had a good side...Not a way to get on it.
 That was fun. Oh, don't look at me like that. I know you hate me. Guess what? Everyone hates me. But you can't deny it. We were bad ass.
 Uhh. Happens.
 Could you turn it up a little bit? It's not annoying yet.
 When are you going back to school?
 Oh come on. Just drink already. Come on, this self-detox is not natural.
 How long did it take you to wean yourself of it the last time you indulged?
 That's not good.
 I don't get it; you know, you don't have to kill to survive. That's what blood banks are for. I haven't hunted in a human in...God way too long.
 It's completely self-serving. I'm trying to get the town off the trail of vampires which is not very easy considering that there is an entire tomb of them running around.
 We are not going to do much of anything if you don't have your strength. There's nothing wrong with partaking in a healthy diet of human blood from a blood bank. You're not actually killing anyone.
 Well, what are those holier-than-thou reasons? You know, we never actually discussed this. You know, I'd- I'd love to hear this story.
 Very much so.
 You do? Well, then you should just carry on, making the rest of us vampires look bad.
 Have a great day, Stefan.
 Oh, hey, almost forgot something. Oops.
 He's a Gilbert?
 You ask I come. I'm easy like that.
 Ah, just like I remember.
 Did you know that your uncle has been kicking it with the Founders' Council?
 Yep.
 What happened right there?
 A few days, give or take.
 Give then, I don't know. What's the big deal?
 Well, maybe his problem is that he has spent too long not being himself.
 It is what it is Elena. The Stefan you know was "good behavior Stefan", ‘reign it in Stefan", "fight against his nature into an annoying excessive level Stefan" but if you think there isn't another part to this then you have not been paying attention.
 Well, he doesn't want to be me. That doesn't mean that deep down though he's not.
 Come on, don't be a downer, it's a party for the founding families! That would be us. That would be rude to skip it.
 Oh I still do. I just love that they love me.
 How are you feeling?
 No cravings? No urges? Is that whiskey you've been drinking all day doing its job?
 We are who we are Stefan. Nothing's gonna change that.
 Whatever, it's inevitable.
 Don't embarrass me young man!
 Have I entered an alternate universe where Stefan is fun?
 Eventually. One way or another.
 You know I love a woman in uniform but I have to side with this one. You look...you look smashing.
 Thanks Liz. It's really nice how welcoming the council has been. I like my life here in Mystic Falls. Starting to feel like home again.
 No, I have been too preoccupied with yours.
 Jeremy has been asking questions about Vicki Donovan's death.
 Really? "Oh but sheriff, someone buried her. Who would do that?" I know I know! Me! I mean I could compel him but he's wearing vervain.
 If he keeps asking questions...
 Okay. Don't say I didn't warn you.
 John.
 Yeah. It's a pleasure. Are you enjoying the kick-off?
 Yeah. When was the last time you were here?
 Oh, not long at all.
 I wouldn't overreact John.
 That's the story, huh?
 Oh, there's more?
 And you're telling me this why?
 You know that I could rip your throat out before anyone would notice?
 Yeah, okay. But you probably ingest vervain so...
 You wanna hear the bad news or the really bad news?
 Alright, let me rephrase. Do you want to hear how the council is back in vampire mode or how I just killed Uncle John Gilbert?
 Great party by the way, huh?
 You got to be kidding me.
 Look at his right hand.
 Towns favorite's son. Look at his ring.
 Yeah, and that would be a big coincidence if he didn't just came back from the dead five minutes ago. Where the hell did you get that ring?
 Who gave birth to Elena, under the medical care of the esteemed DR Grayson Gilbert, John's brother!
 I think John knows a lot of things.
 Going somewhere, hm?
 Sure know a lot for someone who just got to town.
 So you did know her?
 You sent her?
 How do you know about Katherine?
 What do you want?
 We have a problem Stefan and when I say problem I mean global crisis. It seems Uncle John has...
 You don't look so good. Its different this time, isn't it? The need is too strong. Of course it would be after all these years.
 Have a good night brother.
 Compromised? You mean stolen?
 How lucky for us, we have John.
 Well, of course, I mean if it'll help.
 John, whatever I can do to help keep this town safe; even if it means spending time with you.
 I suppose I should be grateful, you learned how to use the bell.
 On behalf of or in spite of?
 You're playing house with half of a tomb of really pissed off vampires. What do you think was going to happen?
 Why isn't she here telling me this?
 Well, it's a coincidence, ‘cause I don't do forgiveness. Just run along. And if you're going continue playing house with these little vampires pets, you might wanna stop robbing the blood bank dry because they're onto it.
 Then it's one of your others.
 Well, where did they go?
 How was school?
 Yeah? Same old, same old? Nothing new? No stories to bring home?
 You seem awfully chipper lately, less doom and gloom, a little more pep in your step.
 I don't want to brag but I would definitely take responsibility for this new and improved you.
 Yeah, not possible.
 Stefan, just be serious for a second. You spent the last century and a half being a poster child for Prozac and now you expect me to believe that this new you has nothing to do with human blood. Nothing.
 You're lying!
 Well well, he's a liar and a thief. So, when were you gonna share?
 No, no, no I'm talking about the fact that you're a closet blood junkie.
 Under control? You robbed the hospital!
 Fine, whatever man, drink up. Just remember, we're trying to keep a low profile. Why don't you just walk up to Sheriff Forbes and ask her to tap a vein?
 Yeah, what's Elena thinks about the new...you?
 Clearly.
 You've been off the human stuff for years, Stefan. If you're having trouble controlling...
 Who do you think you're talking to? I know what it's like. That Jekyll and Hyde feeling, that switch, sometimes it goes off and you snap. Right now is not a good time for me to be worried about you snapping.
 What do you want?
 Most people take that as a hint.
 How do you act John? You obviously don't care about catching vampires, you're here talking to me.
 What Isobel say about that? I mean, considering that she is one.
 What is it?
 Why bring me into it John? I mean, I don't know what you are talking about much less who has it.
 I'm not playing anymore. Get out. Get out.
 You know, I only entertain this whole blackmail scheme thing of yours because I thought that you and Isobel could lead me to Katherine but see, now I know you've no idea where Katherine is, because if you did you would know that Katherine and Pearl were best friends. See, you don't know everything, do you John?
 Go for it! I'll kill every last one of them. Then I'll sever your hand, pull your ring off, and I'll kill you too. Do you understand that?
 In the running for Miss Mystic Falls?
 Ah, nostalgia's a bitch.
 John Gilbert thinks your mom stole an artifact from Jonathan senior back in 1864.
 I don't know what it is but I don't want him to have it.
 Because you want to stay in Mystic Falls and John Gilbert's in town, making that impossible. Find out where it is. He leaves, you can buy a welcome mat.
 We need to talk.
 Normally I would have a completely different outlook of what I'm about to tell you but since it could really inconvenience me, I'll squeal.
 Stefan's still drinking human blood.
 Yeah, a month ago I would have rejoiced but with the council back on the alert, it is not a good time for Stefan to fly off the handle.
 He has a fridge full of stolen blood bank contraband in the house.
 He has no idea what normal is, his entire existence isn't normal. Normal to a vampire is drinking human blood but he spent all this time fighting it when he should have been learning to control it and now it's controlling him instead.
 Stefan on human blood Elena; he'll do anything, he'll say anything because he's not gonna want to stop. Trust me.
 I was just filling Elena on your extra-curricular activities.
 I'm uh - I'll be downstairs, drinking.
 I don't know.
 Right now, we just have to get through this.
 There were signs of a struggle in the upstairs bathroom.
 There was blood and that Amber girl is missing.
 Let's just find him, okay? Let's get your coat come on!
 Stefan, come on get control. It's okay, come on. Breath through it man.
 It's okay. Stefan.
 It's a good thing the girls got here when they did, she lost a lot of blood.
 No, I got here before they got too close. There was too much blood, they couldn't see it clearly.
 All right now, this is getting weird.
 Not in the mood, today's been a no good, very bad day.
 I‘m listening.
 What is it?
 It was a pocket watch.
 So what is this?
 What's the catch?
 Sure you want to do this?
 There's no guarantee it's going to work.
 Coming?
 Katherine. Katherine.
 Stefan. Stefan.
 You're the one who locked him up.
 I couldn't have him running around chewing on people. While the town was looking for vampires, now, could I?
 Your thing, not mine.
 I woke up last night. I didn't know where I was. I went to the church. And I watched them drag her inside. Then they set fire to it. And the whole church went up into flames. They killed her, Stefan. She's gone.
 Nope. Whatever it is, it doesn't work.
 She thought she was stealing his vampire compass, but that was a pocket watch. That Johnathan Gilbert was a crazy scientist. Have you spoken to your uncle lately?
 So, you'll be here again tonight?
 Yes. You're a complete nuisance.
 Brought you something to eat...100% Stefan diet approved. You know what will happen if you don't eat. You'll get all rotting and crusty.
 Of course you are. We're eternally hungry. Take it. The human blood should be gone by now. You want to explain why you're still in here. Feeling sorry for yourself? Come on. Drink up. Fine. Starve. What do I care?
 Hello?
 Before I hang up, how did you get this number?
 What kind of digging?
 Well, did he find anything?
 Isobel knows John. Whatever. We knew that.
 Isobel's in Grove Hill?
 Perfect. Give me the address.
 I'm not going with you. You tried to kill me.
 Hold on.
 What?
 Extra broody. Hold on. You drive. Pick me up in an hour.
 He won't eat anything.
 His favorite kind of what?
 Ew. Gross.
 Helps me. Now, hurry up. I can't baby-sit all night. I have things to do.
 Ha ha. Stefan likes...Puppy blood...Little golden retriever puppies with cute, floppy ears. That's his favorite.
 As if he cares. He betrayed us.
 God. This sun hurts my eyes.
 That's not gonna happen.
 Isn't it yours? This was all to be with Katherine. But she's gone. I want it over.
 He's just being dramatic. He's not gonna starve himself.
 He feels bad about hurting that girl. It's a very typical Stefan martyr stuff. It will pass.
 Yeah. Well, that will pass, too, once he eats.
 I know what you meant. Look, are you gonna be okay here if I have to run out? I have to go to an errand with the teacher.
 I don't have any friends, Elena.
 You should, um, you should stay up here. You shouldn't be down there by yourself.
 You know...You're very trusting of him, given the circumstances.
 I won't be long.
 This is where it gets tricky. I may or may not be able to get in.
 By the owner or the person of entitlement. Short-term rentals and hotels are a bit of a gray area. You kind of gotta play it by ear.
 You mean, you just brought me along for my company?
 Yeah. I'm good. No permanent resident, apparently.
 Uh, Ric, we have company.
 Boys, boys, that's enough. I know you.
 Your name is Henry. You were in the tomb.
 Well, I've known him for years. He's a good friend. How do you know him?
 That's my friend's very passive-aggressive way of asking, uh, do you know a woman named Isobel?
 The others?
 Well, that's John. Heh. He's such a do-gooder.
 Oh. Hey, let me talk to him.
 Am I gonna...answer that?
 "Let's not not kill anyone tonight." Your words. Just pointing that out.
 Find anything yet?
 Well, I found this. Behind the blood in the fridge.
 I wouldn't beat myself up over it, man. What did you think you were gonna find, huh? Isobel with a cigar and slippers?
 Really? After only two years? That's actually moderately healthy.
 Well, I figure the 200 mark is probably a good stopping point.
 She charmed me, your wife Isobel. She talked a good game, man. She was smart. She had this excitement in her eyes. I probably should have known there was something different about her, some tie to Katherine. There had to be some reason I didn't kill her.
 Ugh. God. You're still here?
 No. Ahh.
 Futile. Although, I think I witnessed the teacher having an existential crisis. Has Stefan eaten yet?
 Chalk it up to morbid curiosity.
 This is my fault now?
 Let me ask you a question. In all this important soul-searching and cleansing of the demons of Stefan's past, did you ever manage to get the rest of the story?
 Yeah. That's an understatement.
 What are you doing? Who is that?
 What have you done, Stefan?
 You fed.
 No.
 Katherine is dead, Stefan. There's no world without her.
 I don't want it.
 No.
 No. I can't.
 No. I can't.
 From the moment Stefan had his first taste of human blood, he was a different person. I suppose I should thank him. It's been a hell of a ride. Heh.
 His choice. If he's stupid enough to make it, so be it.
 Where are you going?
 You were right. It is a whole new world.
 You got what you wanted...You and me for all eternity. But here this, brother. I will make it an eternity of misery for you.
 Little boy lost.
 No, Stefan, thank you. You're back on Bambi blood, and I'm the big badass brother again. All is right in the world.
 You brood too much. Everything on this planet is not your fault. My actions, what I do, it's not your fault. I own them. They belong to me. You are not allowed to feel my guilt.
 If I wanted to, it's there. Emily waited till after I turned to tell me she'd been successful in protecting Katherine with her spell. She didn't want me to know about the tomb. She thought it would impact my decision.
 Witches...Judgy little thing.
 'Cause I didn't want you to know. 'Cause I hated you and I still do.
 But not because you forced me to turn.
 Because she turned you. It was just supposed to be me, Stefan...Just me.
 Well, I'm doing great, thanks for asking.
 Oh, him? Oh, he's...he's terrible.
 He's just back to boring, straight-laced, off the junk. You've successfully cured him of anything that was interesting about his personality.
 I hate myself. Did Uncle John mention anything to you about my field trip with the history teacher?
 I don't know. But I'd love if you could find out for me.
 Have fun with the Mystic queen, I know I did.
 Elena called.
 Sorry I'm late. My dog ate my uh...never mind.
 What's with all the furrowed brows?
 Isobel is here? 
 Did you ask her about Uncle John? Are they working together?
 No they're not?
 What about the invention?
 Did she know about the tomb vampires?
 Did words completely escape you?
 What did she want?
 Oh! I take it that's not okay with you guys.
 We should be in there.
 I'm not going to kill her in a crowded restaurant.
 She ruined your life and you still want to protect her?
 Yeah, she's given up her humanity.
 You can turn it off, like a button you can press. I mean, Stefan's different. He wants the whole human experience. He wants to feel every episode of How I Met Your Mother, so he shuts his feelings out. The problem is, as a vampire, your instinct is not to feel. Isobel chose the easier road - no guilt, no shame, no regret. I mean, come on, if you could turn it off, wouldn't you?
 Of course I have, Rick. It's why I'm so fun to be around.
 Oh Oh Cherie, you won again. I hope I'm wearing my good underwear.
 It's good to see you, Isobel. I was just having fun with your naughty little minion.
 Searched all the neighborhood bank-owned foreclosures and found the most expensive one.
 Well you caused quite a stir, you blew into town. Saw everyone except for the man who made you. I'm a little hurt. (leans in towards her.)
 Heh. Ow. What are you doing with John Gilbert?
 I'm sure. One of the many. Now, this little invention what do you want with it?
 Oh yeah? What side is that?
 Why are you doing her dirty work?
 So do I.
 Now that I have your attention, listen up. You do not come into my town; threaten the people I care about. Going after Elena? Bad move. You leave her alone or I will rip you to bits because I do believe in killing the messenger. You know why? Because it sends a message. Katherine wants something from me? You tell that little bitch to come get it herself.
 Absolutely not!
 I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel so she could give it to John who is going to turn it to kill me. I like being a living dead person.
 I don't trust her.
 No, I'll get Jeremy in my own way.
 It's not piano lessons, honey.
 What?
 Name a book...How about "Call of the wild", Jack London?
 Jack London. Great parlor trick.
 Great, now what?
 Would you like one? Say it, whatever it is, purge, get it out.
 What about?
 Well, this is going in an interesting direction.
 Same here, Elena is a very good friend. Actually, she might qualify as my only...friend. Is that a problem?
 Oh, there's no risk, you do.
 Sure. Sure.
 Whatever you say man, I mean honestly we're just friends and as a friend I wasn't looking forward to telling her the truth anyway so, I'll let you do it.
 About John. Because I know you guys don't like to keep secrets from each other.
 Am I the only one around here who has the ability to put two and two together? Isobel! Hello? She dated John when she was 15; she gets pregnant and ends up at the doctor's office of John's brother. Now, what do you think John's role is in all this? I mean, go ahead, and think about it, I'll wait. Did you get it? You there yet?
 Ding, ding, ding, ding!
 I don't need any proof, that's a DNA test for John, Elena and Maury Povich to deal with but I know how well you deal with these bombs so...Sleep tight.
 Oh and when you do tell Elena and she needs a friend to talk to about anything, I'm here for her.
 Look at you, all retro.
 Why wouldn't I be here? Bonnie deactivated the Gilbert invention, Isobel is gone and it's Founders' Day! I'm here to eat cotton candy and steal your girl.
 Oh, you started this Stefan with that whole "I'm insecure, leave Elena alone" speech. I'm enjoying that.
 What? You have no sense of humor, Stefan.
 'Damon humor'...Hey look, I get it, I get it. I'm the better, hotter, superior choice and you're scared, now that Katherine is out of the picture, that I'm gonna turn all my attention to Elena. But don't worry, Elena is not Katherine.
 Just watching the parade.
 Where are you going?
 I wanna say something to you.
 Thank you. The device that Emily spelled could have killed me. I don't take what you did lightly so...thank you.
 I know that, but I'm still very grateful. And...I owe you.
 Enjoy the parade.
 I like you better like this. The period look, it...didn't suit you.
 Actually Elena, it is a compliment of the highest order.
 Did he mention something to you too?
 No, nothing worth repeating.
 You do not talk to me like that! I'm not your sister. And for now on, don't talk to your sister that way either.
 Cut her some slack.
 No, I did! She was protecting you.
 You'll be unconscious before you even got a word out.
 Good cop, bad cop. I like it.
 He's being a punk.
 Oh, there's only one "do-gooder" role available. My bad. I'm sorry.
 You see, there you go with that little jealousy act again. What are the right reasons, Stefan? Enlighten me, please!
 You're still around?
 How do you know this?
 When is this supposed to happen?
 John Gilbert wants to use that invention on them.
 It doesn't work, it's been deactivated.
 Where are they right now?
 Ric!
 You keep those nifty little vampire darts in the car?
 Because this square is crawling with tomb vampires. I think we might need a stake or two.
 Saving your life. Fifteen words or less...Tomb vamps are here. Founding families are their target. Get her out of here, now!
 That's more than fifteen words, Stefan.
 Do you have any idea what you've done?
 Mayor. Is that you?
 I'm a vampire. What's your excuse?  No, really. The vervain didn't affect you, you're not a vampire, what the hell are you?
 Anna's dead.
 I know you cared about her.
 I saw her killed. I was watching and all I could think about was...I wanted to help her, but I couldn't.
 I took away your suffering once before. I can do it again, but it's your choice.
 What I did to Vicki was wrong. I'm sorry for my part.
 It's very true.
 Is what easier?
 Life sucks either way, Jeremy. But, at least if you're a vampire, you don't have to feel bad about it if you don't want to.
 I did it for a...I did it for a very long time and life was a lot easier.
 Failed and feeble attempt at doing the right thing.
 It's not important. Let me take this for you.
 You know, I came to this town wanting to destroy it. Tonight, I found myself wanting to protect it. How does that happen? I'm not a hero, Elena. I don't do good. It's not in me.
 Nah, it's reserved for my brother, and you...and Bonnie...who, even though she has every reason to hate me, still helped Stefan save me.
 Because she did it for you. Which means that somewhere along the way, you decided that I was worth saving. And I wanted to thank you for that.
 Liz, I came as soon as I got the message. Is she okay?
 Sure, anything Liz.
 Mayor Lockwood was a vampire?
 It's okay. It's okay.
 She doesn't know how, do you?
 No, you don't because it took Emily years to learn a spell like that.
 I can give Caroline some blood.
 No, just enough to heal her. She will be safe in the hospital and it will be out of her system in a day, she will be better Elena.
 If I do this, you and me, call a truce?
 I know this is probably the last thing you want to do right now but we should talk about what happened tonight.
 What? When? What are you talking about? After I left?
 Come on, Elena, you know I was.
 Really? Earlier, on the porch, we were talking, all cathartic, feelings exposed. Come on, we kissed, Elena.
 If you want to forget what happened fine but I can't.
 Oh!
 Mmm, you got to be kidding me.
 Katherine happened.
 Did she say what she wanted?
 Woman certainly knows how to make an entrance.
 She pretended to be Elena too when I showed up earlier tonight.
 Move.
 Katherine wants you dead; there's zero you can do about it; you would be dead but you're not. So clearly she has other plans.
 To risk another frown line encroaching on a very crowded forehead. We...kissed.
 Well, you know, when two lips pucker and they go.
 Don't be obvious, Stefan.
 She's Katherine. She loves to play games and you're fooling yourself if you think you're going to find out what she's been up to before she wants you to know.
 I've got a better idea.
 I'm just gonna ignore the bitch. See you.
 If Katherine thinks she's been ignored it will lure her out, she'll make a move.
 Stake her, rip her head off, something poetic. We'll see.
 No, no. No one's implying that.
 Carol...
 Liz...
 We're all on edge here. You've suffered a great loss. The whole town has. We have to stick together, okay? Trust each other, we'll get through this.
 Who's the guy with Carol?
 Is he on the council? Like John Gilbert was when he rolled in?
 Thanks. See you. (Damon continues to watch Mason and Carol.)
 Well, I know it took the mayor down.
 Yes Bonnie, I would love to know why a non-vampire was tortured by the vampire torture device that you let John Gilbert use against us. Speaking of your guilt, how's Caroline?
 You're welcome.
 Why am I welcome?
 No good deal goes unpunished with you, does it?
 Now you need to stop with the witches' brew. You're starting to believe your own press.
 Great Elena. Walking on the sunshine, thanks for asking.
 Elena.
 I kissed you; I thought you kissed me back. Doppelgänger hijinks ensued. How do you think I'm doing?
 No, I don't get hurt, Elena.
 You're scared. You think Katherine is gonna send me off the deep end, don't you? I don't need her for that.
 You know, why - why is it such a surprise that I would kiss you?
 Now I'm hurt.
 I tried to track her but she's gone. Oooh, cover up, Fabio. You better watch out, looks like Katherine is trying to steal your guy.
 Isn't it? I mean it's only fair since I went after your girl.
 So what's it gonna be huh? Fight to the death? Go ahead, make your threats, stake your claim.
 Why?! I'd fight me.
 Brother, don't you worry, our bond is unbreakable.
 I kissed Elena.
 Very brave of you to come here.
 Leaving so soon?
 Don't pout. It's not attractive on a woman your age.
 Why don't I kill you instead? What are you doing here?
 I'm better at the enigmatic one-liners, Katherine. What are you up to?
 Okay, wait, brief pause.
 I have a question. Answer it and it's back to fireworks and rockets red glare. Answer it right and I'll forget the last one hundred and forty five years that I've spent missing you. I'll forget how much I loved you, I'll forget everything and we can start over. This could be our defining moment because we have the time. That's the beauty of eternity.
 I just need the truth, just once.
 Just doing my part in the neighborhood watch.
 That's me, your trusty bodyguard. Calm in crisis.
 No, I'm not upset. Upset is an emotion specific to those who care.
 You're surprised that I thought you would kiss me back? You can't imagine that I believed that you would want to?
 That what we've been doing here means something? You're the liar, Elena. There is something going on between the two of us and you know it.
 And you're lying to me, and you're lying to Stefan, and, most of all, you're lying to yourself. I can prove it.
 Lie about this (he looks like he wants to get closer then through her in her bed and have his way with her).
 That's where you're wrong.
 No, it's not okay, Elena. He wants to be a vampire.
 You want to shut out the pain? It's the easiest thing in the world. The part of you that cares just goes away, all you have to do is flip the switch and snap!
 Well, the sheriff has asked me to take the lead on that and I promise you I will get to the bottom of it.
 Whatever you need Carol. As a founding family member it's something that's very close to me so I would be honored to help keep this town safe from vampires.
 Is it safe to talk?
 Oh yes, please. Thank you Carol.
 Care for one?
 Are you worried that one day, all the forest animals are gonna band together and fight back? I mean, surely they talk.
 I like this. You, walking on eggs shells around me because you think I'm gonna explode. Very suspenseful. Is Elena worried too? I bet I'm your every conversation.
 I think the Lockwoods have a family secret because the Gilbert device affected them but vervain didn't so they're not vampires, they're something else.
 You'd rather some unknown supernatural element running rampant upon our town. Fine, I'll drop it.
 Sure we do. She came back to profess her undying eternal love for you so I'm gonna let you deal with her because I have more important things to do like explode. Cheers!
 Jeremy, it's so good to see you alive.
 A hundred and fifty years too old. (He takes some of Jeremy's popcorn and eats it.)
 So please tell me that that is not a threat.
 This is what we're not gonna do  we're not gonna walk around like we are invincible when it's this easy for me to end you. I will shove this ring so far up your ass, you'll really have something to choke on.
 I'm observing.
 He's got strength.
 Enter the uncle.
 Stefan wants to go.
 Get him Stef!
 You didn't put in any effort at all.
 Come with me.
 Is he...?
 What is up with that family? They're not vampires, what the hell are they?
 You're not funny.
 No comedic timing at all.
 This is reality and there's no such thing as werewolves or...combat turtles.
 Hey you!
 Yeah I don't care. I need you to pick a fight with someone, a kid named Tyler Lockwood.
 It's just an experiment. Get him mad, don't back down no matter what he does, okay?
 I know you won't.
 No, someone is going to get mad, as in rage.
 That Tyler kid is incapable of walking away from a fight. Let's see who intervenes; maybe it's the ambiguous, supernatural mystery uncle.
 Hey Blondie, they let you out?
 What do you remember?
 You're crazy.
 You can't remember. It's impossible, I mean unless you're becoming a...
 Wait...
 Elena.
 I know I'm the last person you want to see right now but I need you to come with me.
 Yeah, I need you to come with me right now, Elena.
 Well, I fed her blood and Katherine obviously killed her and A plus B equals...
 Because Katherine is a manipulative, nasty, little slut.
 It means she's playing dirty. She wants us to know.
 I don't know.
 Oh I think she does. All of my compulsion from the past started wearing off the minute she was in transition.
 Yep, and kill her.
 She knows who we are. She's officially a liability, and we've got to get rid of her.
 Need I remind you of a tragic little story of a girl named Vicki Donovan? Caroline, of all people, will not make it as a vampire. Her mother is a vampire hunter. Guys come on, we all know how this story's gonna end, just flip to the last chapter and...
 No? Your silence is deafening, Stefan. Wait, wasn't there a school carnival the night you staked Vicki? I never had a town where history repeats itself. You know I'm right.
 It's the only way.
 Hey, hey it's okay. I can help you.
 Yeah, I have to.
 The only thing I can do. I'm gonna kill you.
 Yeah, but you are already dead.
 Okay.
 Okay, okay. It's the only way.
 Stefan!
 She will die, it's only a matter of time.
 Oh, yeah, it is.
 Whatever happens, it's on you.
 Come on, don't pout about it. I got a body to bury.
 I thought you were calling the shots. No? Hm, it sucks to be you, buddy.
 I didn't do this!
 What the hell are you doing here?
 Yeah.
 Why would you do that?
 You came here to kill me?
 What made you wisen up?
 Look, I don't do the big brother thing very well. Sorry, I don't have any milk and cookies to offer you.
 Wait. My father hated vampires too.
 For the same reasons your dad did. Only it was 1864. People knew how to whittle.
 Did you do this?
 Thanks for coming, Ric. Can I get you something to drink? Coffee, bourbon? Bourbon in your coffee?
 Well, you wouldn't. But your dead, not-dead vampire wife might.
 Like that amazing vampire story.
 No way, impossible, way too Lon Chaney.
 I've been on this planet one hundred and sixty some odd years, never came across one. If werewolves exist, where the hell are they?
 Because vervain didn't affect the mayor at Founders' Day but the Gilbert device did and it affected his son Tyler.
 So can we get access to it?
 Ric, we need to know what we are dealing with. If this wolfman thing is true, I've seen enough movies to know it's not good.
 It means Mason Lockwood is a real-life Lon Chaney and that little Tyler punk may just very well be Lon Chaney junior, which means Bella Lugosi, meaning me, is totally screwed.
 Sorry you can't come too, Stef.
 Oh, I'll take really good care of her.
 Okay, time to go.
 How are you doing back there? You know, this whole pretending to hate me thing is getting a little silly.
 There is a huge asterisk next to that statement  he came back to life.
 Why are you so sure I didn't know?
 Yes.
 Elena, I saw the ring! It's a big tacky thing. Hard to miss.
 Where'd she go?
 Pull it out. I can't reach it Elena. Just pull the damn thing out. It hurts.
 That bitch is dead.
 Watch me.
 What makes you think that has any power over me? Because I took an arrow in the back for you? You're severely overestimating yourself.
 You're trying to manipulate me.
 I'd be extra nice to me right now.
 Nope, not at all.
 No, that would be creepy.
 You know, if you want to see me naked, all you have to do is ask.
 Any luck?
 Ah, man, you know, it's a bummer we're not friends anymore because I could tell you what I know.
 Can they control the transformation?
 Well, if werewolves were hunting vampires, I would know about it.
 Oh...
 Head scratcher, isn't it?
 Well, if I know anything, I'm not gonna tell you, not with that attitude.
 Here. Allow me. You're not gonna be able to hate me forever.
 You didn't dig deep enough.
 Katherine originally came from Europe. Petrova was her real name. Katerina Petrova, to be exact.
 Back when, I saw it engraved on an old heirloom. Men snoop too, you know. Let me know what you find, I'm very curious myself.
 You have every right to hate me, I understand but you hated me before and we became friends. It would suck if that was gone forever. So, is it? Have I lost you forever?
 Road trips work well for us.
 Oh come on! You know I chipped a little bit off of your wall of hatred.
 No. No, I didn't. Katherine really pissed me off and I snapped and...I got lucky with the ring. I don't know what I would have done if he wasn't wearing it. Elena, I'm sorry.
 But you knew that already, didn't you? You used me today.
 I thought friends don't manipulate friends. You and Katherine have a lot more in common than just your looks.
 Be prepared to lose.
 So, this is where you spend your time when you're not stabbing people in the back.
 Where are you going?
 Okay. See you at Jenna's barbecue.
 It was my idea. Jenna went to high school with Mason Lockwood so I figured a social gathering would be a good way to get to know the guy. So I told Ric to tell Jenna and...
 Perfect. Thank you. I'm hoping this peach cobbler will pave the way.
 I'm gonna put some silver into Mason Lockwood and prove he is a werewolf. See you at the barbecue.
 Everyone will you please join me in raising your glasses to my good friend George Lockwood. George, thank you for so bravely defending the south.
 Hey.
 She doesn't like me very much.
 Oh sure. Damon Salvatore.
 Really? That's weird. I'm a dick!
 I told you I would come.
 Did my little brother's confession overwhelm you?
 Is my love not enough?
 Good night Katherine.
 No, no.
 Mason wins...again.
 Aunt Jenna is getting tipsy.
 I want her to like me.
 He's my new BFF.
 Yes, thank you so much for inviting me.
 I know what you must think about me.
 I'm a work in progress.
 These are fancy.
 Mason, why don't you start us off?
 Really? I always pegged you for a lone wolf.
 Well, I just happen to like "Guitar Hero". So you, my friend, are barking up the wrong tree.
 Thank you.
 How do you know about me? Your brother was completely clueless.
 You tried to kill my brother.
 Really?
 What, no obedience school?
 You expect me to believe that you are in Mystic Falls planting peach trees?
 You know, I should probably head out too.
 Jenna, you are a wonderful hostess.
 Is that the only thing that makes me terrible?
 Good enough for me. Alaric, let's not catch that game next week.
 Nah, those got old.
 Duly noted.
 Bad century. I heard you were on the loose.
 I don't do jealous. Not with you, not anymore.
 I tried to kill a werewolf, I failed. Now I feel like I'm not living up to my best self.
 What do you know about werewolves?
 Been there, done that. At least this time it'll be worth it.
 What are you doing?
 I don't want peace.
 Stefan, please tell me you don't seriously think a hand shake just solved our problem.
 Hey, I saw you with Mason earlier. What was that about?
 That's why I'm here for, put me to work. Should I go help him?
 Are you okay, Liz? You seem really upset.
 Is there anything I can do?
 What's her problem?
 Why are you being such a bitch to your mom?
 Relationships are about communication.
 Well, Mason. Working hard?
 I heard you talked to Stefan.
 Yeah, a lot nicer than me.
 That's what I thought. Huh!
 So what's up this faux drama in your relationship?
 Oh come on, Stefan. You and Elena don't fight, especially not over me.
 With pleasure.
 Thank you, sweetie.
 Vervain! Vervain!
 I'm gonna kill him.
 I'm not listening anymore of your "give peace a chance" crap. He's dead!
 Alright. Let's do it.
 Woods. Trash duty. Come on.
 Don't look so surprised. You knew this was inevitable. Go ahead, run. I'll give you a head start.
 Liz, please.
 But you're my friend.
 You need to drink some deputy blood.
 This is a most unfortunate situation. Two deputies dead and you.
 What am I gonna do with you?
 But you were gonna drag it out so painfully.
 Relax guys. No one is killing anybody.
 You're my friend.
 We've got to clean this up.
 Tsk, tsk, tsk.
 Thank you. It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's secure. Brought you a good thread count. And once the vervain's worked its way out of your system, I will compel you, you will forget everything and you will be a free woman.
 She's your daughter, Liz.
 You have no idea how wrong you are about that.
 I heard and you?
 Hey, Stefan didn't drink the people blood, if you were curious, but he needs to and deep down you know that.
 And why do I need to talk to you?
 Wow, fascinating. Not enough.
 A moonstone?
 And you're bringing me this why?
 What's your sister say about this little discovery?
 Oh, you haven't told her, have you?
 And you're a Gilbert and you just can't help yourself. Wow. Your search for life's purpose is as obvious as it is tragic.
 Ric!
 What you got?
 Mmm, Vanessa. The hottie.
 Sun and the moon, blah blah blah blah blah.
 Most of them, anyway.
 It's a witch thing, whatever seals the curse is usually the key to unsealing the curse.
 If we start believing in some supernatural witchy-woo legend from a picture book, we're idiots. Who has the stone now?
 Can you get it?
 See, now your life has purpose.
 It's the same book that says a werewolf bite kills a vampire. Ignoring it would make me an even bigger idiot. Let's go.
 Looking for my baby bro. Speaking of, would you tell yours to stop following me around?
 Ask eager beaver.
 Katherine's with Mason Lockwood?
 I know, but Mason Lockwood?! Werewolf thing aside, the guy is a surfer. She's got to be using him. She has to be.
 Mason Lockwood's looking for a moonstone that allegedly can break the full moon werewolf curse. Maybe Katherine wants it as well.
 Well...no idea. That's the beauty of Katherine; she's always up to something.
 Jeremy is getting it from Tyler.
 He's playing Indiana Jones. He involved himself.
 Okay.
 A favor.
 So predictable.
 That's why I brought him.
 Pretty please.
 I guess.
 All you have to do is touch Mason Lockwood again to see if he gave Katherine the moonstone.
 How inconvenient. Although, let's talk about that little witchy juju thing you do with me. You know, the fun one where my brain bursts into flames? What is that?
 Is it vampire specific?
 Good. Good, good.
 Mason Lockwood's a werewolf, Katherine's evil. They're the bad guys. Really? You're gonna play morality police with me right now? Let me put it to you another way  they're a threat to Elena. So you, witch, are gonna get over yourself and help us.
 Absolutely.
 Okay, grab that corner.
 Because I don't want to stain the carpet.
 Judging again.
 Whoa. Looks like this guy's used to being tied up.
 What are you doing?
 Oh, good, yeah. Find out if he gave it to Katherine, and find out where she is. And find out what they're gonna do with it once they get it.
 Like a sewer?
 Why would it be in a well?
 Hey, judgey!
 Thank you.
 Come on. Wake up, wolf boy.
 Someone's feisty.
 You can hurt   good to know. I was afraid you were gonna be some beast mass with no affinity for pain.
 Oh, but you heal quickly. Not good. Guess I'll just have to keep applying pain.
 So...Katherine. How do you know her? What is she up to?
 I have all day.
 When did you two meet? Did she seduce you, tell you she loved you? You're supernatural so she can't compel you. I'm sure she used her other charms. Katherine's good that way.
 I thought I told you to leave.
 Ooh. What is it?
 What else did you read?
 I'm guessing toxic.
 What's Katherine doing in Mystic Falls?
 Why is she here?
 How rude of me. You know, I just realized, I didn't offer you anything to eat.
 Yummy!
 Why do you want the moonstone?
 Ahhh! Wrong answer!
 I'm taking your eyes now.
 I know where it is. I want to know what it does and why you want it.
 Why?
 Of the moon? Now, why would a vampire help a werewolf break a curse that keeps them from turning whenever they want?
 Why?
 Now - now I get it. You're just stupid. Katherine doesn't love you. She's using you, you moron.
 Yes, you are.
 It's time to take a walk, Jeremy.
 No, you should go.
 You wanted to be a part of this? Well, here it is! Kill or be killed! The guy is a werewolf; he'd kill me the first chance he got! So, you suck it up or leave.
 He wants me to kill him, anyway. Don't you, Mason? It really is a curse, isn't it?
 You know, I look at you I see myself. A less dashing, less intelligent version.
 Oh, I know! I've been where you are. But Katherine will only rip your heart out. Let me do it for her.
 All this for that?
 Had to be done.
 "Carol, big opportunity in Florida, I'm gonna be gone for a long time. Will send for my things once I get settled. Much love, Mason"
 Oh, last number dialed. I wonder who that could possibly be?
 Wrong boy toy.
 He's right beside me! Although, his heart's across the room.
 I've had a very busy day today. I killed a werewolf, found a moonstone. Hey, did you know that he hid the moonstone in the bottom of a well full of vervain? I guess he didn't trust you very much. Although, he did love you. Poor guy. Hey, where are you? Because, you know, I could bring him over. Last goodbyes and all that.
 Aww, did I put a kink in your master plan? I'm so sorry.
 Elena. I riled Katherine up. I - I wasn't thinking. I didn't think.
 Here.
 Go ahead, tell him. You're gonna love this.
 Skip the teen drama and get to it.
 Tell him the rest of it.
 She's running scared. What she did to Jenna was desperate. She's out of tricks.
 No, Katherine's not getting dick. I've had it. I'm gonna go to the masquerade ball and I'm gonna kill her, tonight.
 Don't give me that goody-goody crap.
 Really?
 Yeah. Cold feet speak now. I don't want this going wrong if someone chicken's out. Caroline.
 Oh, I took care of Mason.
 Except Katherine. Tonight Katherine gets a stake through her heart.
 Do you see her?
 Who are you talking to?
 Well that is the fork in the road between you and me my friend. I don't hesitate.
 I won't hesitate.
 We'll dump her when we get back.
 Stefan, it's collateral damage.
 What? Who's hesitating now? Hey! Don't do this to me! This woman ruined our lives, she destroyed us! Tonight it ends. We can do it together. I got your back. All right?
 Wait!
 And the evil slut vampire who only loved herself.
 Oh, that Damon died a long time ago.
 Sorry about your pet wolf, probably should have kept him on a tighter leash.
 Damn it! Where is that witch?
 What are you mumbling about over there?
 You and me both, honey.
 You're wasting your breath, Stefan.
 Right away Miss Katherine.
 The second the spell is lifted, I'm gonna drive a stake right through your heart.
 I wouldn't do that.
 Hello Katherine.
 Where you should have been all along. I thought you'd have learned your lesson by now, messing with a Bennett witch.
 Death would have been too kind.
 From who?
 You're lying, you're always lying.
 Then I'll protect her, while you rot in hell.
 Does Matt remember anything?
 Yeah, I don't understand that. The guy is a tool.
 Well, no.
 Where is your mom?
 Oh, teens today and their underage drinking. Tragic. Wait, did you see Tyler's eyes turn yellow?
 Oh.
 Only on a full moon but now he has increased strength and who knows what else. I wonder how much Mason told him. Does he know about us?
 Hey! What did you tell him?
 He's got to know something.
 No, you won't Caroline! He cannot know about us. A bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire so don't be his friend! Do you understand me?
 Right. If you want to drop the hint to your mom, that Aimee's body is at the bottom of a ravine with a cracked spine. Might save your mom some time.
 Katherine's in the tomb. Trust me; I'm the one who shut her in.
 Did I what, Stefan?
 She's in the tomb, period. End of story but she did say something to me right before I shut her in. I thought she was lying.
 Elena's in danger.
 Everything she says is a lie. How am I supposed to know if she's gonna start spouting out the truth?
 No, no. Let me tell you how that's gonna go  We're gonna go ask her for help, she's gonna negotiate her release which we're gonna be dumb enough to give her and she's gonna get out and kill us! This is exactly what she wants!
 It's a bad idea, Stefan.
 He's not. Let's go.
 It's Elena.
 Alaric sure likes his weapons.
 What the hell is that?
 Weird.
 About 80 miles.
 Someone from Katherine's past. She said she was running from someone. They got the wrong girl.
 Can we not do the whole road trip bonding thing? The cliche of it all makes me itch.
 The elephant in the room lets out a mighty roar.
 There's nothing to talk about.
 Keep it up, Stefan. I can step out of helping as easily as I stepped in.
 If you want some, just ask.
 Ah, that's so sweet. You're gonna be all big and strong and save your girl but don't worry, I've got your back. It'll be fine.
 Does Elena know you're drinking blood?
 Hmm, how romantic. Since we're road trip bonding, remember the days when all you lived for was blood? You were the guy who ripped someone apart just for the fun of it.
 Yes, Stefan, exactly. Back when you put blood into me so I could be a big bad vampire. I wonder if Elena would be so quick to open her veins to that guy. By the way, what happened to that guy? He was a hoot.
 The house should be just beyond those trees. Wait, I got a lot more experience than you do with those sorts of things.
 My point is, whoever has Elena is probably who was after Katherine in 1864 and before that.
 And it puts them at 500 years old and strong. Are you sure you want to do this?
 Because if we go in that house, we may not come back out.
 So noble, Stefan.
 Down here.
 Where's Elena?
 And you're here why?
 Here.
 I know, we'll keep her safe.
 Yes Stefan, I heard it all before.
 What?
 About what?
 Enough Stef, it's late. Don't need to rehash that.
 Cute PJ's.
 I brought you this.
 I just have to say something.
 Well, because what I'm about to say is...probably the most selfish thing I have ever said in my life.
 No, I just have to say it once. You just need to hear it. I love you, Elena and it's because I love you that...I can't be selfish with you. Why you can't know this. I don't deserve you but my brother does.
 God, I wish you didn't have to forget this but you do.
 Hello, Elena.
 Right this way.
 He's one of the originals, he's a legend.
 What they're saying is, I mean if what she's saying is true...
 And you're not saying it so I don't kill you.
 Then we're looking at a solid maybe.
 That's not helping.
 Alright, we're shaking. You made your point.
 All right Rosebud. I need some answers. Oh please don't tell me you're crying ‘cause your buddy Trevor lost his head.
 Full vampire switch for this very reason. Takes the emotion out of it.
 Is that a dig?
 I'm not in love with anyone.
 Don't get on my bad side.
 How do I find Klaus?
 Come on. Somebody's got to know somebody who knows where he is, right?
 Humor me. You got in touch with Elijah, how did you do it?
 Perfect. I'll drive.
 Then you drive. Come on.
 Back entrance. How convenient.
 How do you know this Slater guy is even here?
 Good.
 Just one thing. If you're setting me up in any way, I will rip your heart out and shove it down your throat. It's something I'm very good at.
 Whoa. What about the sunlight?
 Beyond dead.
 The point?
 Really?
 Here's what I don't get  Elijah moved around during the day, which means the originals knew the secret of the day ring. Now why would Klaus want to lift the curse of the sun and the moon?
 Not such a rumor.
 Awesome doesn't even begin to describe it. Can we stop the curse from being broken at all?
 Well, if we make the moonstone useless, would it stop the curse from being broken?
 Tell me how.
 You want to walk in the sun? I can make that happen if you help us.
 You're gonna be okay.
 Who's behind that?
 Iowa by now. Who the hell knows?
 Who did it?
 I believe you.
 And I will.
 Why? Why him?
 And where did that get him?
 To friendship.
 And why's that?
 Caring gets you dead, huh?
 I will if you will.
 Let's do it.
 1,2,3.
 We went to see Katherine.
 I'd rather poke my eyes out.
 Feel like tossing it over?
 Meaning you're hungry.
 No, of course not. We just want the moonstone.
 No spell, no doppelgänger sacrifice. Ergo, you live.
 Cause we have a crafty witch on our side.
 Well, what he means to say is, we will pry it from her cold, dead hand if we have to.
 Yep. We're awesome.
 It's a plan. Is it perfect? 
 Gee, thanks, you 16-year-old child. Why didn't we think about that? Why are you even here?
 What will this do?
 Alaric's stake gun's in my trunk. Bonnie?
 Jeremy couldn't take the pressure, huh?
 Not a good time, Rose.
 Why, what did you do?
 Tell me.
 What are you doing here?
 She lied.
 
 Come on. We're leaving.
 I said we're leaving.
 You do not get to make decisions anymore.
 Who's gonna save your life while you're out making decisions?
 Get your ass out the door before I throw you over my shoulder and carry you out myself.
 Don't ever do that again.
 Time to go. Alice is soundly sleeping and won't remember a moment of this horribly stupid day.
 
 There's nothing here for you.
 
 Well, your ride left you. I didn't want to leave you stranded.
 Yes, she did. She's been running for 500 years.
 If I had a dollar for every time some evil vampire surprised me.
 What you did today was incredibly stupid.
 What?
 Don't you dare.
 What are you talking about? I was too busy saving you from your crazy kamikaze mission.
 It was the right call, Elena.
 Are you done?
 Don't.
 Of all the idiot plans, Stefan.
 I'll find a way to get you out.
 You martyr yourself in a tomb and I get partnered with a semi-competent witch. Wonderful.
 Yeah. 'Cause that'll be easy.
 Promise.
 It's for the best. Trust me. Elena is on a martyr tear that rivals your greatest hits. You should be glad the witch and I are even getting along. I brought you this.
 Care package  candles, lanterns and...lunch.
 Yeah...
 I've been dead before. I got over it.
 Once we deal with this moonstone, we'll figure a way to get you out.
 You should really lock your door. 
 Yes Elena. I find hilarity in the lengths that I have to go to repeatedly save your life.
 We had a good laugh.
 Yeah, that...I didn't tell him.
 Well A  he can't do anything about it; and B ...what I just said.
 Where is Bonnie?
 No, she's on moonstone duty and I'm on Elena patrol.
 Vampire Barbie asked me if she could handle it, and I said, why not? Figured if she screwed up, he'll bite her and then I'll be rid of two of my problems.
 Yep, but you were too absorbed with all your suicidal tendencies to notice.
 What?
 What? Why?
 What girl?
 That's not good. Where are you?
 I'm on my way.
 Change of plans. You babysit.
 Hey you know, you should get out, enjoy the sun. Oh wait, you can't.
 Mmm, Mason's mystery woman.
 Decomposing in his truck.
 Well I hope not, being that it's a full moon, Ric, but we should definitely find out.
 Wolfsbane.
 Excuse me, is this guy bothering you?
 Perfect. Well...Do it elsewhere.
 Don't worry, he's harmless. He's sort of the town drunk. And you know, when we get tired of him we just put him in a cab and send him back to wherever he came from.
 Why are you here?
 There's a B&B down the road and there's a motel on I-90 but you know, if you ask me, it's kind of a mistake.
 Who?
 I know Mason!
 Yeah. He's a great guy.
 What do you mean? Like...I mean, missing missing?
 Friends of friends.
 You know, listen, I'm really tight with the sheriff. If there's anything I can do to help locate Mason, I will. He's a great guy, and after his brother's funeral, he stuck around and helped his nephew and...
 Yep. Mason was with him the whole time. Helped him through all that grief. 
 Oh, come on. Look, one drink.
 To sleep.
 What do you want with Mason Lockwood?
 Well, I'm sorry to inform you that you probably won't find him.
 You should leave town.
 I think we're done, Rick.
 You think I'm afraid of you?
 Where is she?
 So what? Just let her get away? "You've been marked". What the hell kind of wolf throw-down crap is that anyway?
 
 You just can't stay away, can you?
 What do you want?
 Just admit it, you don't have anywhere else to go.
 There's nothing here for you, Rose.
 How bad is it?
 
 You're gonna be okay.
 I talked to Caroline. She said Tyler was all locked up.
 Yeah. I'm sorry. I picked a fight with her. She was coming after me.
 You're all healed?
 Rose...uh...I'm happy that the legend was fake. Maybe the werewolves made it up to keep vampires away.
 Help me do what?
 Really? Why?
 Just friends?
 Are you sure you can do that?
 I think I like you.
 Well, if you were a bottle of wine...
 You know, if you're gonna be morn, I'm just gonna kill you myself just to put me out of your misery.
 Come on, it's just a little werewolf bite.
 Well, according to a legend which is notoriously unreliable source. Drink up.
 Blood heals.
 Let's have a look, come on. Let me see.
 Definitely...better. Right, Elena?
 Where's Stefan?
 No, can do. I'm with Stefan on this one but if you could play nurse for a little while...
 It is necessary. Elena is a do-gooder. It's in her nature, she just can't resist.
 Probably. The wolf bite caused some kind of infection and it's getting worse.
 I don't know, Elena. I'm not an expert in the field.
 Death happens. We come, we go. Sooner she dies the better. It's gloomy as hell in here.
 What are you doing here?
 Oh, damn. There goes my plan to rip her spleen through her back.
 Why does everyone think that I'm upset about Rose? I'm fine. I don't know if you know this but sometimes, vampires die. I'm gonna have a friendly chat with lady wolf, brother. Ease up.
 You won't live to see another full moon unless...unless you tell me how to cure a wolf bite...and then I won't kill you.
 Yes.
 Then you are very, very stupid.
 If there's a cure, tell me or start watching your back.
 Are you okay? Where's Rose?
 Hey.
 No, I was close by Liz, what happened?
 We have to secure the area then.
 Sure, okay.
 My baby brother is not exactly my priority right now. Take this.
 Come on, let's go.
 Rose, stop!
 Rose, Rose! It's me, it's Damon. It's Damon.
 I know.
 Come on, let's get you home.
 Hi there.
 You went on a murderous rampage. It happens.
 You shouldn't be here.
 Stop talking about it.
 Go.
 Just go. I got this.
 I‘m not nice. I'm mean. I like it.
 Shhh, just sleep. Just sleep.
 Word gets around. You told Elena.
 Humanity is not all it's cracked up to be.
 You still do.
 You didn't have a choice, you were running from Klaus.
 You know, you're ruining a perfect day with your strange philosophical babbling.
 For a while.
 For what?
 I'm glad.
 I think you'll see whoever you want to see.
 Well, you'll lose.
 Oh, you think?
 Well, I'm controlling this dream. Maybe I'll cheat.
 Here's your vampire.
 It doesn't matter. What matters is that it's over.
 I'll take care of burying the body.
 You were supposed to leave.
 I appreciate the gesture. I'm just glad it's over.
 Go home, Elena. Get some rest. It's a whole new day tomorrow.
 I'm well aware of that.
 What do you want to hear? That I cared about Rose? That I'm upset? Well I didn't and I'm not.
 I feel Elena, okay? And it sucks! What sucks even more is that it was supposed to be me. Jules was coming after me.
 That would be human of me, wouldn't it Elena? And I'm not human. You want to talk about giving up? That's all you've done is give up! Go home. It's been enough doom, gloom and personal growth for one night.
 I'm...lost.
 Not that kind of lost.
 Metaphorically, existentially.
 Well, yes I do. Can you help me?
 No. Well, yes a little maybe.
 No please don't leave. I really do need help.
 Don't move.
 Neither do I but all I got is trouble.
 What's your name?
 Hi Jessica. I have a secret, I have a big one and I never said it out loud. I mean, what's the point? It's not gonna change anything, it's not gonna make me good, make me an adopt a puppy. I can't be what other people want me to be, what she wants me to be. This is who I am, Jessica.
 I'm not sure because you are my existential crisis. Do I kill you or do I not kill you?
 But I have to, Jessica because I'm not human and I miss it. I miss it more than anything in the world! That is my secret but there is only so much hurt a man can take.
 Okay. You're free to go.
 You brought back John Gilbert? That was your big "Save Elena" move?
 We're not that desperate, Stefan. The guy tried to barbecue me!
 I'm still waiting for the part where John Gilbert is the answer.
 And how do we do that?
 Great work Stefan. Top notch. As if I didn't have enough problems.
 Whatever. I knew the woman for five minutes.
 It means I care, Stefan. It means I'm changing, evolving into a man capable of greatness. Better watch your back, because I may just have to go get a hero-hairdo of my own, and steal your thunder.
 Where's John?
 That's public knowledge now?
 Are you okay?
 He said what he was doing here?
 Do you believe him?
 Me neither.
 Kill him.
 I'm joking. Okay, I'm a little serious.
 I'm not gonna hurt him, Elena. I'm the good guy now, remember?
 I'm gonna have a civil conversation with your father.
 Yeah, but stupid is so much more fun.
 Okay then.
 John, buddy, how have you been?
 So, John. Rumor has it that you know a lot, and won't say anything.
 Only because all of the vervain had left her system. Stefan and I, on the other hand, are chock full.
 It's an acquired taste. I don't see that magic little ring on your stitched finger, so if you know something about Klaus, you better start talking, or I will kill you in your sleep.
 I know you. The news lady.
 My glass is all full, Andie. Thank you.
 I'm steering clear of all women at the moment.
 Trust me, it's in the best interest of women everywhere.
 Why am I just finding out about this now?
 That I'll what? That I'd kill him? Of course, it's what's need to happen.
 Why? He's a werewolf, he needs to die. I'm willing to kill him, it's win-win.
 You need to stop doing that.
 Assuming that I'll play the good guy because it's you who's asking.
 Do you mind?
 Well guess what John, trust works both ways. Get out.
 We don't need to do anything. I'll take care of it.
 First dad duty  ground your daughter. Keep her here.
 My brother the peacemaker. Since Stefan got here before me I'm gonna let him try it his way before I resort to my way, which is a little bloodier. So give us Caroline.
 Give us Caroline. Without a full moon it's not an even fight and you know it. We will take you.
 You heard her. Go. Get over there.
 Uh, that'd be me.
 We can take them.
 Well then...
 What do you want?
 I'll bite.
 I agree with that statement.
 What is that?
 How do you know all this, John?
 Where is Isobel?
 I like a woman who knows what she wants.
 I'm not that tall. I need a distraction.
 You see, the only thing is, miss sexy-reporter-girl, I have a problem I need help with. It's really messing with my mind.
 I'm in love with a woman I can never have.
 Yeah. but that's not the point. The point is, I'm in love with her, and that drives me crazy. I'm not in control.
 I don't trust myself around anyone, Andie. I'm bad, Andie. I do things. I kill people.
 Don't be afraid, you're okay.
 Because I like it. It's in my nature, it's who I am. But then, I have to stay together to protect her, and she wants me to be the better man, which means I can't be who I am. Do you see the problem I'm having, Andie?
 Just stop talking. Just kiss me, be my distraction.
 
 Writer? What's his name?
 Smith. He's using Smith?
 Okay. You have your story straight in your mind, right?
 And you're falling hard.
 Perfect.
 Have a great day, honey.
 My new girlfriend. Andie Star, action news.
 I know. I just like saying it. Come on.
 So, John Gilbert gave me this to kill Elijah.
 Said you have to dip the dagger in the remains of an old white ash tree that dates back to the Originals, if there's any truth in that.
 It could be. Guy's a weasel. Wouldn't put anything past him.
 What are you up to today, Mr. Saltzman?
 Where Elijah's the guest of honor.
 No. That would be stupid.
 I want to know his endgame before I kill him, but I do think it's time Elijah and I officially met.
 Hi.
 Thanks for introducing us, Jenna.
 Carol.
 Hi.
 Mm-hm. 
 I was hoping we could have a word.
 Safe with Stefan. They're laying low, you know, bit of a werewolf problem.
 I'm sure you did since it was your witch that saved the day.
 Which adds to my confusion on exactly why you're here.
 Not good enough.
 You can't kill me, man. It's not part of the deal.
 Today was a bust.
 Sore.
 He's gonna be hard to kill.
 I'm out of sources.
 Ooh. 
 If I did, who would report her death?
 Good luck.
 
 Get over it, honey. You're never gonna get it.
 
 So he planned to kill her all along.
 Got it loud and clear.
 Finally. You missed all the fun.
 It was straight from the witch's mouth. He was gonna go through with the whole sacrifice. You should probably just keep her away a little longer.
 Yeah. It's been a day for that.
 Well, I showered. I shaved. Had breakfast. Very relaxed.
 I did hear one piece of good news though. Tyler Lockwood ran away from home last night.
 Well, I heard it from Sheriff Forbes, who heard it from a very distraught Carol Lockwood, thus, ending our werewolf chapter, bringing us to...
 Exactly.
 Well, I've got a crafty little dagger.
 Oh, trust me, Stefan. I'm gonna dot all my t's. I don't want any surprises.
 Yes, Stefan, I've become you. How tragic for both of us. Got to run. I've a murder to plan. Busy day.
 Company, brother?
 Are you mad bringing them here when the entire town is hunting us?
 Leave this place. Never think of it again.
 Same for you. Leave this place. Never think of it again.
 Staying alive is more fun, Stefan. We have to be more careful than this. More clever. Like Katherine was.
 I'm done here. With you. I'm leaving town.
 No, you will get us killed. I'd rather leave you to do that to yourself.
 Other than your lecture on the history of Mystic Falls, did you get anything out of Elijah?
 You sounded jealous. Sound a bit jealous?
 Andie, she's been compelled not to divulge my secrets. Haven't you?
 I just need the right opportunity.
 Ah, there's Jenna with her new boyfriend. Hi.
 So I hear you two had quite a meeting of historical minds today.
 Ooh, my girl. Full of good ideas. I'll be happy to host. Say tonight. Maybe?
 Great.
 Great. Drink up. Good girl.
 I've come bearing gifts. I didn't have time to properly shop, but I did get a couple of things. Hmm?
 Wow, that blood did the trick. You're almost pretty again.
 Guess who's back in town? Your old friend, John Gilbert.
 Says he loves his daughter, wants to protect her from Elijah and big, bad Klaus.
 Yeah, right. He told me this old wives tale about how to kill an Original.
 Now, why not? I mean, you want Elijah and Klaus dead as much as I do.
 Sucks for you.
 Can so.
 Even with a dagger and a little white oak ash?
 You're really scared.
 I get you out of here and your ass is sipping Klaus-free margaritas on some unknown island somewhere. No way.
 Well, thank you, you've told me everything I need to know.
 You have. You have indeed confirmed that it is possible to kill an Original, which I will do tonight. Guess who's coming to dinner?
 There's no such thing as a bad idea. Just poorly executed awesome ones. Here.
 Jenna's perfectly safe. Besides, it's just a fact-finding mission. It's totally harmless.
 Yeah.
 Scout's honor.
 Dessert.
 Elijah's stronger than me. Faster than me. It's all about the element of surprise.
 Which is why you should encourage the gentlemen to take their after dinner drinks in here while you do coffee in the kitchen with the girls.
 Stop talking.
 John. Surprise. Leave.
 What he said.
 Thank you for coming. Please, come in.
 No, nothing, nothing dishonorable. Just getting to know you.
 Crystal.
 Hmm, do tell.
 Andie's a journalist. Big on facts.
 So, why do you want to know the location of these alleged massacres?
 Of course.
 Would anyone care for some cognac? I have a bottle that I've been saving for ages.
 So, let me guess. In addition to the moonstone, the doppelgänger, the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, you need to find this witch burial ground.
 Maybe. Tell me why it's so important.
 Hmm.
 Elijah, did John tell you he's Elena's uncle-slash-father?
 Of course, she hates him, so there's absolutely no need to keep him on the endangered species list.
 All right.
 Says the guy that did all the killing.
 Little tip. Don't pull the dagger out.
 Uhh! What do we have here?
 A little moonstone bar of soap. I'll hold on to this.
 Pretty much.
 That seems fair.
 Seems like she's had a change of attitude. How did you get through to her?
 Lexi?
 You must be the vampire I hear my brother complaining about.
 We are at irreparable odds.
 Help him. He needs it.
 Andie? I thought you left.
 How did you get out?
 And you knew.
 What are you doing here? I told you to leave.
 You're wearing her clothes? Like that's going to work.
 When we killed Elijah, it broke the compulsion and freed the bitch from the tomb.
 If you know something, say it or get out.
 No kidding. How do you know so much about Original vampires?
 So when I told you my plan to kill Elijah, why didn't you warn me that I'd die if I used the dagger on him?
 Did you know I would die?
 Why are you still here?
 Oh, I would.
 None of your business.
 Can you tell me where a bunch of witches were massacred in this town a couple centuries ago?
 Then you can't help.
 Elijah wanted to know the site of the massacre.
 I don't know. What did papa witch and baby witch have to say?
 Like the power you get from a spot marked with a hundred dead witches?
 Can I help you?
 Nope. You know this whole friendly, cooperative thing?
 I don't buy it.
 Lie.
 You're the unwanted house guest. Go feed yourself.
 Nope.
 Yeah, bummer.
 Katherine.
 What happened?
 Some kind of crazy ass psychic witch attack! Get over there and do something about it. Go!
 Here you go!
 That's for not telling me the dagger would kill me. Next time...It goes in your heart.
 You wanna help? Start talking.
 Try me.
 That's old news.
 But he still tried to have me killed.
 So you chose Stefan. Of course you did.
 Luka Martin's dead. His father's going after Elena.
 No, you're not.
 I don't need your help. I don't want it.
 We didn't. It was actually her idea.
 No. No, that's not good at all.
 You know what I can't figure out?
 How the town knew Emily Bennett was a witch. I mean, because according to Johnathan Gilbert, he was the only one who knew. I know he didn't turn her in.
 Mmm, I should have figured as much.
 Do I care?
 Because I have no clue.
 Tit for tat.
 You deserved it.
 Katherine. Katherine, there are six other bedrooms in this house.
 Go find one.
 What's she doing here?
 You're the one in cahoots with them. You made a deal with John that almost got me killed.
 Yep. Everybody's dead.
 You know, we could just get another match and cremate him.
 Fine. I'll bury him.
 I didn't know you and father witch were so close.
 Great. We'll have to put that on our list of things to do today. Harness ancient dead-witch power.
 Did I forget to mention that?
 Great. Grab the rest. Let's go.
 You know, you should just stay here. It's better for us to keep an eye on you.
 Well, then we'll stay there.
 Let me know when you come up with a better one.
 Not me. I have witch stuff to attend to with Bonnie.
 Shh.
 No, we have it.
 It's in a very safe place.
 Let me be honest with you. Don't mistake the fact that we haven't set you on fire in your sleep for trust.
 Founders thought it was poetic burning her where the other witches burned.
 'Cause I tried to save her. Emily was just my key to getting Katherine back before I knew what a nasty little bitch Katherine was.
 Whatever witchy prank you're playing, don't. It's not funny.
 I can't move.
 Oh, my ring's not working. Do something.
 I'm gonna go wait outside.
 Wanna hurry it up in there?
 Screw you too, Emily. You know, you're all on your own in there.
 Hey. How is he?
 He'll be fine in a couple hours.
 Well...Here's the thing. John's ring, it's an old Gilbert family heirloom that protects its owner from death by a supernatural entity.
 He will be. Trust me. We're gonna need a cover story...epileptic fit, alcohol binge, banana peel, whatever works. But right now I just have to get him out of here.
 Stefan? How'd I beat you and Elena home? What?
 Better be. It's the nicest foreclosure in town.
 Don't be such a pessimist.
 This is Isobel's stuff. It's definitely the right place.
 I don't know, Stefan.
 Which is why we need to take some precautions, 'cause we got played, all of us.
 Although I'll be super pissed if you lock me out.
 Hey, Bonnie said the spell worked. She's locked and loaded.
 Uh-uh.
 Uh-uh.
 That literally makes Bonnie our secret weapon.
 You really think Bonnie can take on Klaus?
 We just need to find him.
 Could she do one of those witch tracking spells?
 Do you think he killed her?
 It's not like she didn't have it coming.
 What are we, twelve?
 No.
 Yes, Elena. Sure.
 Shut up.
 No, no, no. We didn't create a safe house for you to leave it.
 Tsk. Your way, Elena.
 So we go to the dance, we find him.
 Something tells me he's not going to be sixteen and pimply.
 There you are.
 Hey, I need you to put me down as a chaperone at the dance tonight. Klaus made his first move.
 Alaric has a point. I mean, what if he...
 Any time tonight.
 Evenin'
 That was a lame, cheap shot. He's just trying to bait us.
 It's a party, people. Blend. Let him come to us.
 There's Ric. I'll be back.
 I'm not impressed.
 Let me know if you see anything out of whack.
 How you doing?
 Cool as a cucumber. Come on, remember the last decade dance? The vampires were all, "arghh!" And you were all, "aahh!"
 Yes! We did.
 I've got moves you've never seen.
 May I?
 Is it true?
 The part about you having a 50-50 shot of surviving? Is that true?
 So you lay it out on the line for Elena, no matter what.
 Good.
 Your secret's safe with me, but I mean...With all that power, is there no way to increase your odds?
 We wouldn't want that.
 Oh, great. Jeremy told you and of course you told Elena.
 I changed my mind.
 Hey idiots!
 Let me guess...Klaus says hi?
 So?
 What happened?
 What?
 Go find Stefan. Now.
 Now.
 Can you kill him?
 You have the power of a hundred witches. Break it.
 No. Klaus does not get to win tonight, no way. You still willing to do whatever it takes to kill him?
 There you are.
 She's doing what she has to do.
 Stefan, let her do this.
 Stefan, get Elena out of here. I'll deal with the body.
 The sheriff can't know about this. Last thing we need's another mysterious death.
 Get her home. Now. So I can clean this up.
 I'll find him.
 We need to have a little talk.
 Will you please calm her down?
 Please calm down.
 Yes. Yes, I knew.
 You need to listen to me, and prepare for what I'm about to say. Bonnie had to die. Klaus using Alaric's body was a total surprise. She wasn't prepared for that. And he wasn't going to stop, and we weren't going to be able to stop him until he knew she was dead. He had to believe it.
 She cast a spell. Bonnie's okay.
 How do I know when you're going to go blabbing things to your girlfriend?
 See, that's why I didn't tell you. 'Cause you would have never been able to do it. Don't get me wrong, Stefan. I don't mind being the bad guy. I'll make all the life and death decisions while you're busy worrying about collateral damage. I'll even let her hate me for it. But at the end of the day, I'll be the one to keep her alive.
 Ugh. Look. Klaus had to think she was dead. Your reaction had to be real.
 Here's to duplicity.
 We need to kill Klaus, Elena. Real Klaus. Who will probably be coming to pay you a visit soon now that he knows that Bonnie is dead. She's the only one who can do it.
 I hope so.
 Apology accepted. Let me be clear about something. If it comes down to you and the witch again, I will gladly let Bonnie die. I will always choose you.
 Good night.
 Hi, sweetie. Oh, my coffee.
 Mm, good morning.
 I don't know, Stefan. It's your girlfriend. Mine's right here.
 Oh, and how's the shoulder? Got time for a bite? I'm so hungry.
 No!
 Yeah. What she said.
 Ugh! Bye.
 No, she didn't.
 Did she just hang up on you?
 She's lost it.
 Bonnie's the way to kill Klaus, Stefan. He thinks she's dead. We have a chance with her.
 Her way's going to get her killed. So we need to find her and stop her.
 What?!
 That might be your plan. Mine's better.
 Wow, I'd love to lend you a hand, but you wouldn't want me doing anything stupid.
 You and your girlfriend are calling the shots. I'm just backing off, Stefan.
 Hi.
 Let's go.
 Splitting from the team. Going rogue. Come on.
 Investigative journalism....we're investigating.
 Yep.
 Thought you might be dead.
 No, sweetie. We are here to see if she deserves to be rescued.
 I figured you still might be kicking. Alaric-Klaus was blending way too easily. Figured he probably had some coaching.
 Vervain? Your salvation.
 There's always a loophole. Did he tell you to stay in this apartment until he said it was okay to leave?
 You can't say. Did he tell you to do absolutely everything he says until the end of time?
 There's your loophole. Drink this and it'll prevent any further compulsion.
 Answer one question first. You double-crossed us with Isobel, why?
 And where did that get you? Here.
 Be careful with that. If he finds out you have that, you're never getting out of here.
 You owe me. And I will collect.
 Come on.
 Where do you think you're going?
 No.
 If you so much as try and take a step out of this house...
 Stay out of this, Andie.
 Are you kidding me? We just got her back.
 That's twice today you've stood in my way. I wouldn't try a third.
 Just go, please.
 Andie. Go.
 Don't start with me, Stefan. She's just my distraction.
 You should be thankful she's here. She keeps me from going for what I really want.
 And there it is.
 Oh, yeah? What's that?
 Now you've invited him in?
 Really?
 What?
 A what?
 Is that true?
 And you're trusting him?
 You can all go to hell.
 I thought I told you to leave.
 I'm upset. And you know what happens when I'm upset. You have to leave.
 Hey. Hey. Look at me.
 Get out of here, before I kill you. Just go. Go. Now!
 Then why are we letting him break the curse? We can kill him today. With Bonnie.
 I'll write her a great eulogy.
 That's your plan? A magical witch potion with no expiration date?
 You want to come back to life, what about John's ring?
 I'll take those odds over your elixir. What if it doesn't work, Elena?
 I'm surrounded by idiots. I need all the help I can get.
 Elijah is an original vampire, Stefan. One we tried to kill. You're going to believe this guy?
 Why? She's going to end up dead.
 Well, then, that makes you the biggest idiot of them all.
 Then maybe you shouldn't be so sure about her instincts.
 Prove it.
 I don't want to hear anymore.
 Why? It clearly doesn't matter what I think.
 If it works.
 You think it will work. You want it to work. Why am I the only one who's convinced it won't? There has to be another way.
 And you're going to die, Elena.
 That is not a risk I'm willing to take.
 I can't lose you.
 There is another way.
 I saved her life.
 You're so bent on dying, at least this way I know you'll come back.
 It's better than nothing else.
 Go ahead  wish me an eternity of misery. Believe me, you'll get over it.
 Admit it. You just wish you had the balls to do it yourself.
 We both know that elixir wouldn't have worked anyway.
 I screwed up.
 Yeah.
 Ugh. Klaus, I presume.
 Any reason you stopped by to say hi?
 Ha. Thanks for the advice. I don't suppose I could talk you into a postponement, by any chance, huh?
 I mean, come on, what's one month in the whole grand scheme of things?
 That was fun.
 You think if I took his werewolf out of the equation, she might...Get over the fact that I tried to turn her into a vampire?
 But without the werewolf, he can't perform the ritual tonight, which means I would have bought her one month before the next full moon.
 Are you gonna help me or what?
 I gave you vervain, now I'm here to collect. I got it from here, Rick.
 Yeah, only one of us needs to get blamed for this. Get back in the house. Keep Elena from handing herself over.
 I need to know where Klaus is keeping his werewolf.
 Dead werewolf equals no ritual.
 I just need to delay this thing.
 You should like this. It's going to buy another month of your pathetic life.
 What?
 And where'd he get that idea from?
 What if I told you Elena had vampire blood in her system?
 Imagine how much fun that will be competing with Elena for Stefan's love for, I don't know, forever.
 Thank you.
 Wishful thinking.
 What are you doing here?
 Listen, man. Not a good time to play the hero.
 I'm just here to rescue her.
 You're lucky I already screwed up once today or you'd be dead.
 Your boyfriend's outside with a rifle loaded with wooden bullets. You have some explaining to do.
 Shh. Tomorrow's problem.
 Let me just get you out of here.
 Ohhh. It's getting dark soon.
 How fast can you get the hell away from here?
 Don't make me regret this.
 Did you already forget about the part with the gun and the wooden bullets?
 Grab boy wonder and let's go.
 He better not wolf out on us.
 Bad time, little bro.
 Saving the day. I figured you'd understand. Just tell Elena to stay put.
 What?
 I'll take care of it.
 I'm fine.
 Get to the Lockwood cellar. If it held him in, it'll keep him out. If it doesn't...use these.
 It'll buy you a couple seconds. Go. Go!
 I've come here to tell you that you have to postpone the ritual.
 Yeah, but that was before I rescued your werewolf and vampire and killed your witch.
 And you can kill me for it. I don't care. It was all...me.
 Jules.
 Backup vampire.
 Ahh. What the hell happened?
 Ahh. Do what?
 Who did you call?
 Who did you call, Katherine?
 Should have used me. Why didn't he use me?
 What does that even mean?
 It's a werewolf bite.
 Yep.
 Will be.
 Well, that depends. You know anything about a cure?
 Me, either.
 You don't get a good-bye.
 Us ending up on good terms isn't exactly on my bucket list, Katherine.
 That's why I gave you the vervain. So you had a choice.
 I helped you. You owed me. Now when Klaus dies, you're going to walk out of here without a scratch and Elena's aunt dies. Somehow you're the only one that wins. How'd that happen?
 Enjoy an eternity alone, Katherine.
 
 You're not going to like what I'm about to say.
 It's happening. I tried to stop it, but it got...complicated.
 He's got Jenna, Stefan.
 He got Kath to lure her out of the house.
 He's going to use her as the vampire in the ritual.
 
 Great. I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat.
 Well, you're a day late and a daughter short, John.
 Klaus has her. Sacrifice goes down tonight.
 She is safe. I fed her my blood.
 When Klaus kills Elena in the sacrifice, she will come back to life. Granted, as the thing you hate most in the world, but no one really cares what you think.
 You do not want to mess with me right now.
 I know, John. I took her choice, destroyed her future. Trust me, I get it. It actually gets worse.
 He did what?!
 
 God, Stefan, damn it!
 I'm fine. 
 Skip to the save Elena part.
 
 Come on, Bonnie, we got a hybrid to kill.
 That's it? Let's go.
 Sorry, buddy. She's right.
 What about you?
 If you come back as a vampire, I'll stake you myself. So don't.
 Because I can't stand the idea of you hating me forever.
 I don't know yet.
 I'm sorry, Jeremy.
 Elena!
 How do you feel?
 Yeah. Plenty of room with the Gilbert family plot and I compelled two of the grave diggers to do the dirty work. How's she doing?
 I think I'll skip the coffee and tea cakes.
 And then what's the plan, Stefan? The curse is broken. How does one go about killing an all-powerful wolf vamp and his two-faced older brother?
 We need to get an idea. Fast.
 I wouldn't make any promises, brother.
 Tyler Lockwood bit me.
 
 There's no cure, Stefan.
 You want to do something for me? Keep this from Elena. Last thing she needs is another grave to mourn.
 That'll get easier. But you knew that.
 I want to apologize.
 Please. Elena, feeding you my blood, I was wrong.
 And I know I don't deserve your forgiveness, but...I need it.
 Sure. Of course, take all the time you need.
 Get off of me.
 Just did. You know what happened to Rose, Stefan.
 What's the plan, Superman?
 Oh, right. A miracle cure. Good luck with that one.
 Always the hero, Stefan. Just tell me good-bye, get it over with.
 My apologies Miss Katherine.
 Of course.
 I shall.
 I would think Stefan should be company enough.
 Elena?
 I promise.
 It feels worse. My subconscious is haunting me, Ric. Please tell me you have something for that.
 That's good.
 Oh good.
 So my brother sent you for suicide watch?
 He's doing what he always does, trying to right the wrongs of the past.
 You should want me dead. I'm the reason Jenna got killed.
 Oh, sure you do. Let's not forget I turned your wife into a vampire. You must really hate me for that one.
 Kill me. Please.
 No. Elena?
 I need blood. I need blood.
 Liz.
 Katherine.
 Where's Elena? I need to see Elena now.
 Elena.
 Where are we going?
 Wait for me. I want to come with you.
 Why must you always run from me?
 Then let me chase you forever. Feed me your blood.
 I choose you, Katherine.
 Promise me you will not tell my brother.
 I have to...if we are to be together forever.
 Elena?
 Elena.
 Elena, get out of here. I could hurt you.
 Get out of here.
 It's not okay. It's not okay. All those years, I've blamed Stefan. No one forced me to love her. It was my own choice.
 I made the wrong choice. You tell Stefan I'm sorry. Okay?
 This is even more pitiful than I thought.
 I've made a lot of choices that have gotten me here. I deserve this. I deserve to die.
 I do, Elena. It's okay. 'Cause if I'd have chosen differently, I wouldn't have met you. I'm so sorry. Done so many things to hurt you.
 I know you love Stefan. And it will always be Stefan.
 But I love you. You should know that.
 You should have met me in 1864. You would have liked me.
 Thank you.
 You got free.
 And you still came here?
 We're out of champagne.
 Well would you be a dear and walk...
 Hmm.
 Mm hm.
 Good morning.
 Yeah, you should learn to knock. What if I was...indecent?
 Another dead-end you mean.
 You're right, Elena. This could be the one. After almost two months this could be the one clue that tells that Stefan is alive and well and living in Graceland.
 Right, and let Klaus know you're tracking him. He thinks you're dead; let's keep it that way.
 Okay, I'll check it out. If I find anything I'll call you.
 They moved on to Tennessee.
 Which one? Pensacola?
 Up for a road trip?
 Get me that address.
 Because Andie said this was a half lead and I don't want to get her hopes up.
 Still sleeping on the couch? (They're looking around.)
 Mm-mm.
 Yeah. Too quiet.
 Oh yeah.
 Stefan, for sure.
 It's his signature; there's a reason they call him the ripper. Feeds so hard he blacks out and rips them apart, but then when he's done, he feels remorse. It's the damndest thing. He put the bodies back together.
 Definitely Stefan.
 Covering their tracks. Clearly they have no interest in staying in the dark, but I do.
 Hang on.
 Well, what do you know? Werewolves.
 It's your party, you can cry if you want to. Ah, Stefan. Such a pack rat.
 I got you something. I know I promised not to buy you anything so don't worry. I didn't pay for it.
 No! Found it.
 Alaric found it in his loft, thought you'd be happy to have it back.
 You're welcome.
 Absolutely.
 Shall we?
 Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. You don't want that. You want the cheap young stuff over by the cheap young people.
 I love high school parties.
 Ten o'clock broadcast. Should be here in a little bit.
 Hello Birthday Girl!
 Is his stash any good?
 You're screwed.
 Andie wants me to pick her up.
 Well, it's a complicated dynamic.
 Well, hold the fort down, will ya?
 Drink more, you will feel less weird.
 Andie?
 Party Central.
 Umm, by the...punch bowl.
 Oh...Oh, I gotta, gotta go break up beer pong.
 Stefan. (Stefan is standing in the middle of the studio.)
 You don't write, you don't call.
 With who? Klaus? Are we supposed to care with he thinks?
 Saw your latest artwork in Tennessee. Walking a fine line there my friend. Keep that up and there will be no saving you.
 Nah, I got a birthday girl at home that's not gonna let me do that.
 Andie?
 No, no, no, it's okay, Andie. Stay calm. Not cool brother!
 No! No, no, no, no, no NO!
 What? What are you doing here?
 Can we not do this right now? I'm having a really bad night.
 You were an idiot. We both were.
 I know you need to get back to your party, Elena.
 Because they're not Klaus's victims, Elena, they're Stefan's!
 He's left a trail of body parts up and down the eastern seaboard.
 I've seen it happen before. He's flipped the switch. Full-blown ripper.
 No, you stop, Elena! Stop looking for him. Stop waiting for him to come home. Just stop! Stefan is gone and he's not coming back. Not in your lifetime.
 Just can't stay away, can you?
 Yeah, well, busy dating a dead fake girlfriend and all.
 Happy Birthday, Elena. Stefan killed Andie. Cake?
 What?
 Well, what'd he say?
 Where he's binge drinking on the country folk. We went through this, Elena. Stefan's gone. I don't mean geographically.
 Thanks for the tip, brother.
 Get out of the water, Elena.
 Yes, because I'm not an idiot like you.
 I didn't give up on him, Elena. I faced reality. Now get out of the water.
 What's your big plan, Elena? Huh? You gonna walk through a campsite full of werewolves, roast a marshmallow, and wait for Stefan to stop by?
 Klaus thinks you died when he broke the curse. That makes you safe. This, this is not safe.
 It's a full moon tonight, Elena.
 Okay. Okay. But we are out of here before the moon is full and I'm werewolf bait.
 Unless you wanna relive that whole deathbed kissy thing.
 Fine.
 How you doing?
 You know, I could help you.
 Just one little fwoosh.
 The sun's about to set.
 I'm just saying.
 These ropes aren't gonna hold him much longer. What else do we have?
 Aah! Ow!
 Is he turning?
 Don't move.
 Here, doggie, doggie.
 Fancy meeting you here.
 Might want to take it up with your girlfriend. You don't want her chasing you, I'd stop with the late-night phone calls.
 Sure you did. She's not gonna give up on you.
 Fine, bite-free. Get back in the car, please.
 I'll give you 10 seconds. 9, 8...
 I was wrong.
 No. I thought Stefan was gone, but I was wrong.
 No, he's not okay, Elena. He's an insufferable martyr that needs his ass kicked...But he can be saved.
 I changed my mind because even in his darkest place, my brother still can't let me die. So I figure I owe him the same in return. I'll help you bring him back.
 But before I do, I need you to answer one question. What made you change your mind?
 You were so hellbent on staying on that mountain, then you just gave up. So what changed your mind?
 You had a bag full of weapons and a teacher with an eternity ring. You could have kept going.
 It was too dangerous going out there to begin with, so what was it?
 What changed your mind, Elena?
 Thanks.
 Because when I drag my brother from the edge and deliver him back to you, I want you to remember the things you felt while he was gone. Good night, Elena.
 How's it going, Ric?
 You're interrupting my drink.
 Katherine. Where are you?
 What do you want?
 Well, Stefan's still Klaus' little prisoner and Elena still thinks she can save him and no one's thought about you since you left.
 I didn't give up on him. I just don't know where he is.
 But you do. Are you trailing them?
 Which means you know exactly where they are.
 How do you know that?
 Is that what you're doing? Looking out for my brother?
 Where are they?
 Rise and shine, sleepy head.
 You know you were dreaming about me. Explains the drool.
 Fine, don't come with me to bring Stefan home. See ya.
 Windy city.
 It came to me in a dream. I was naked. You would have loved it. Start packing.
 Well, let's just say he's not there to meet Oprah.
 Ooh. Put these in the "yes" pile.
 I sure hope we find him, 'cause it would suck if the last memento of Stefan was that crappy old necklace.
 Read this. Paints a pretty little picture of Stefan's first experience in Chicago.
 You need to be prepared for what you're about to see.
 Here's one. March 12, 1922.
 "I've blacked out days. I wake up in strangers' blood. In places I don't recognize. With women I don't remember."
 Ahh! I'm shocked! Stefan's not a virgin?
 Fine. Back to my game. Tell me if you see a Florida plate.
 There used to be an all-girls high school around the corner, but it shut down for attendance issues. Weird.
 Shh.
 Here we are. Stefan's second personality home.
 Tour is not over yet.
 Look harder.
 Mm-hmm.
 Still handling it?
 I was around. Chicago's a big city. Stefan was a cocky ripper douche. But I could avoid him and still indulge in a few Daisy Buchanans of my own.
 His old stomping ground.
 No. You stay here and whip up an actual plan. I'll come back when I find him.
 Gloria. Damn! If I knew you were going to age like this, I would have stuck around.
 You've seen him?
 You know where they went?
 Gloria...
 Don't be a tease. What kind of errand?
 Make yourself presentable. I know where Stefan's going to be tonight.
 I had an hour to realize what a bad idea it was to leave you here alone, process it, and move on. Are you okay?
 Okay, good. Get dressed. You're all road-trippy and gross.
 Yes, with Klaus. So I'll distract Klaus and you deal with Stefan.
 But you're going to have about five minutes tops before that hybrid freak rips my heart out. So please, tell me you can do this.
 What is wrong with you? You kill Andie one day, you save my life the next. What are you good, bad? Pick one!
 She's not going anywhere until she's got you checked into vampire rehab and on the mend. Trust me. I've tried.
 What are you talking about?
 Tell her yourself.
 Oh, honey, I've been called worse.
 Give me my brother back...You'll never have to see me again.
 What can I say? I'm a thrill-seeker.
 You want a partner in crime? Forget Stefan. I'm so much more fun.
 You okay?
 Okay. You were right. He was there.
 Where are you?
 I'm thinking Europe. Italy, maybe. Or Spain. You were always a sucker for those lazy afternoons.
 I just don't know why you want to bring chili to a potluck. Everybody brings chili.
 Hey, Ric.
 Show up, there's going to be nine other people that brought chili.
 Yeah! I know. I knew your old family. They made sucky chili.
 She knows.
 She's in denial.
 No?
 You're still wearing this necklace. Isn't this the reminder of your unbreakable bond with Stefan?
 So Mayor Lockwood called your gay ex-husband to torture your vampire daughter?
 Can't we just kill him?
 He sounds like a douche-bag to me.
 Is that what you told him when you two got divorced?
 So, Bill, I hear you're into the whole daddy-daughter vampire torture thing.
 Well, if there's anyone who doesn't need help, it's your annoying control freak of a daughter.
 Yep. He's vervain-free.
 So, Bill, I have a question. What makes you think that you can change the basic nature of a vampire?
 Oh, yeah? I completely agree. I actually happen to love mind control, myself.
 You will leave town immediately. All you remember is you came to bring your daughter back-to-school shopping.
 I'm going to let you in on a little secret...Founders parties are just an excuse for the council to gather in back rooms and plot against vampires.
 Excuse me?
 I don't really think it's your problem, Ric.
 What do you think I'm doing?
 Ah, no, I think the sheriff covered it, Mayor Lockwood. Looks like we've made it through the worst.
 Carol.
 Wait, wait, Houston, we have a problem.
 Managing Bill Forbes. Apparently he's impervious to compulsion.
 I have no idea. But he threatened to out me. Don't get me started on the irony of that.
 That's not the most important piece of information I mentioned, Elena.
 He wants to control the council. Says it's been compromised.
 He wants to put vervain in the town's water supply.
 To what? To keep me in check? Make me behave? I should have killed him this morning.
 Yeah, and when I kill him, she'll have one more parent than we do.
 You're repeatedly killing my buzz today, Ric. Step aside.
 Your temporary funeral.
 Whoa, whoa. Is that scotch? I figured you for an abstainer.
 Like vampire compulsion.
 Yeah, yeah, powerful tool. Got it. I'm impressed. Can't say I've ever seen that before.
 Duly noted. I'm curious. Why not just expose us to the council?
 It's a pretty risky move, taking me on, don't you think?
 Makes you the third person to underestimate me today.
 Whoo! You know, with all this behavioral modification going on around here, I almost forgot how good blood tastes when it's...Fresh.
 No, I'm not going to kill you, Bill. I'm just going to find pleasure in perfect little moments like this.
 Let me teach this ass-wheel a life lesson.
 Or what?
 I'm stronger than you, little girl.
 Bummer. I love a good girl fight.
 Why not? It's nothing I haven't done before. Why is it suddenly so important for everyone to keep me in check?
 What? A monster? Sorry to disappoint you, Elena, but last time I checked, I was still a vampire!
 I am not Stefan. How about you stop trying to turn me into him?
 Wake up!
 It took a bit longer than usual, huh? Might want to get that ring checked. Hope it's not going bad.
 You pissed me off.
 Ric, no hard feelings, all right? I was on a bit of a tear. Everyone was trying to tell me how to behave.
 I'll accept written apologies only.
 Katherine. Wonderful. What do you want?
 You have impeccable timing. I was told I need to take a beat.
 Why not? Walls are starting to close in on me around here. Where are we going?
 Oh, stop being cute.
 We've been driving around aimlessly for hours. Where are we going?
 Not to worry. Mystic Falls and I are on a bit of a break.
 Let's just say Elena and I are having a bit of difference of opinion on how I should behave.
 Something like that.
 I thought I'd give it a shot. Truth is, you just don't do it for me anymore.
 I thought we might want to stretch our legs. Take a break from the sexual tension. I'm tired of driving. It's your turn.
 We're not going anywhere until you spill your guts.
 Why would Klaus want Elena's necklace?
 I'll keep that in mind.
 Oh, yeah? What's that?
 I'm not turning back.
 Jeremy? Really?
 I'm listening.
 I'd say you were desperate and lying. Or drunk. Or desperate, lying and drunk.
 Vividly.
 Well, why not?
 Well, this is all great...But she's dead.
 Who?
 Also dead.
 Stop with the teenybopper drama. Focus.
 What's she saying?
 Jeremy, I just want you to know, it's nothing personal.
 Anna, I know you can hear me. Tell us what you know. The sooner, the better for your little boyfriend here.
 Who's Mikael?
 What's she saying?
 It's time to go find the keys.
 Don't fall asleep, Jer. You might have a concussion.
 Where's my phone?
 You know you have it.
 Katherine, phone, now.
 Bonnie's been texting me.
 It's Klaus.
 Shut up, Katherine.
 Stay with her so Anna can guide you. I'm going back.
 I wouldn't have done it for you.
 Where is she?
 You'll have to kill me.
 Don't you want to know about your friend Mikael?
 Just that he knows you're here.
 Katherine and I found him. Consider it our leverage.
 Hey.
 Hey, have some bourbon. It'll help you forget.
 Yeah, it's strong. You know I can help you forget, too. At least the memories you don't want to keep.
 I stole it back for you.
 I shouldn't have left. I promise you...I will never leave you again.
 What are you doing here, brother?
 Hey, the two brunettes on the staircase owe me a Persian rug.
 So this is what Klaus had in mind when he compelled you to protect Elena?
 Who the hell are you?
 You're Klaus's sister?
 What? What do you mean, "what"? I've been calling you for two days.
 Jeremy Gilbert told me that you found Mikael.
 Well, try harder. We need him to kill Klaus so I can de-rippefy Stefan before he destroys my house.
 Yeah. So...You might not want to come here for a while. We have a new housemate. Barbie Klaus.
 She's stranded. Apparently Klaus left her in the dust after I name-dropped Mikael.
 Oh, you know Stefan. Journaling, reading, shaping his hair.
 Is that the bell? Oh...Ring! Ring! Don't want to be late!
 What? Are you going to bench press a vampire?
 Helping you out.
 Come on, Buffy!
 You called. I'm here. What's your plan, oh warrior princess?
 Compulsion or not, Stefan's high on human blood, Okay? A lot of it.
 This is different. It's not a stint in rehab, Elena. His humanity's gone. Light's out. No one's home.
 Feel that? It's a sternum. Solid plate of bone.
 Right here, just below the ribcage, next to the spine, that's your way to a vampire's heart.
 I'll do whatever it is you need me to do, Elena.
 No one going to hurt you. Especially not my brother.
 Can't Bonnie just ju-ju him or something?
 We're forgetting a key player here. Rebekah? Wherever Stefan goes, the blonde ponytail tends to follow.
 How?! She's an Original. Last time I checked, we're out of daggers.
 Are you ever not going to be mad at me for a day?
 Uh-oh.
 Oh, boy.
 He's been sired.
 Sired. He feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus's blood created him.
 He'll seek acceptance from his master. It's really rare. But maybe not so much in hybrids.
 Get a new boyfriend.
 Like you can talk.
 No, you're just looking at it all wrong. This is a little rough on the outside.
 But the inside...Yum.
 Yep.
 Can't believe you've never had one of these before.
 That's no excuse.
 Well, I could be mean if that's what you're into.
 Just trying to be a good housemate.
 No, let me.
 Elena, you almost got barbecued. The least I can do is apply first aid.
 Oh, yeah?
 Yeah, before she skewered me. I thought you were too drunk to notice.
 So was I.
 Great work tonight, Ric. Sorry about the car, man. Bummer.
 Keep it up, Stefan.
 Oh, you got to be kidding me.
 Oh, Stefan.
 Low blow, Stefan. Low blow.
 Whatever twisted ripper game this is, leave me out of it.
 Quit screwing around!
 Yep.
 Yeah, not to worry. I'll just untangle myself.
 Greetings, blondie. Witchy. I think you got your voodoo wires all crossed when you got rid of Vicki Donovan.
 Because I'm pretty sure I just got spit-roasted by Mason Lockwood's ghost.
 Maybe because he chained me to a chair and shoved a hot poker in my chest. Let's just say I'm having déjà vu.
 Yeah, well, I don't have time for a vengeful Lockwood. When I kill someone, they're supposed to stay dead. Whatever you screwed up, fix it.
 Oh, come on. Have a drink with me. We've got trouble.
 Ah! But remember back when you liked me and we conspired to kill Uncle werewolf Mason Lockwood?
 I think he's still a little pissed.
 Told ya.
 I am never going to hear the end of that damn necklace.
 Let's get to it. I killed you. You want revenge. Get in line.
 Don't you have a family to haunt? You know your nephew has turned into a mindless hybrid Minion.
 Well, sorry to break it to you, buddy, but Tyler can't be helped. At least not while Klaus is alive. Which is, like, always.
 There is no weapon that...What do you know?
 You got to be kidding me.
 You're right. I didn't have to kill you. I do a lot of things I don't have to do.
 What, you're going to bury me alive?
 You put a snag in my only other Klaus lead. So I'd say I'm highly motivated.
 How do you know so much?
 What are we looking for?
 Oh, come on, give me the thing. Move.
 You first.
 The thought crossed my mind.
 I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop. Your motives are deceptively pure.
 I'm supposed to believe you're not going to screw me over?
 All right. Which way?
 Aren't you supposed to be all-knowing?
 Yo. Help a brother out? Mason?
 Oh, I'm having a bad day.
 What's your game, man? I killed you. I jammed my fist into your chest. I ripped your heart out. There's no way this whole buddy-trust act is real.
 God! This is not happening.
 I can't get through. It's like I'm not invited in. Wait!
 Yeah, but...
 So? What'd you find?
 No, no, no, no. No, where'd you go? Mason, Mason!
 You're here. It's about time.
 No, actually, I don't. 'Cause I need a non-vampire to get in the cave, and other than Elena, you're pretty much the only one I trust.
 Look, if Mason Lockwood can get over the fact that I killed him, can't you cut me a little slack, Ric?
 Well! Sometimes...I do things I don't have to do.
 Yeah, well...I didn't mean it with him.
 So was Mason screwing with me, or is there something in there?
 Ric. Ric?
 What is it?
 Elena!
 Boo!
 Scaredy-cat!
 No. Seems even the ancient Lockwoods were anti-vampire.
 
 Well, this is as far as I get to go.
 Yeah, it's the "Lockwood Diaries  Pictionary-Style."
 Long. It gets better. Show her, Ric.
 That's what I said.
 Yep. I now like to call him "Papa Original".
 Sloppy!
 "Ghost of Christmas Past" Mason Lockwood set up the cave and led us to a weapon that can kill Klaus.
 Yes. Which probably means the wall will lead us to Mikael, who we have already found...and lost. 
 Fine! Fine! If I am being irritatingly optimistic like you two...how do you suppose we do that?
 Well, make sure she doesn't power struggle you into a wheelchair.
 Mmm...pasty and pouty.
 You know I'm not a big champion in this whole Lexi-Recovery-Plan...but Elena thinks this place is gonna weaken you up, break you down and make you feel again...
 What are you talking about? It's Family Day at Vampire Rehab! So, I'm paying a visit to my baby brother.
 Nahhh. I thought we could hang out, a little brother bonding. How've you been, Stef? Huh?
 Liar, liar pants on fire, brother. Klaus compelled you to protect Elena, and if you thought for even a second that she was in danger, you'd be working a lot harder.
 Yep.
 You really have given up.
 Screw this Lexi-plan. I think we could both use a drink.
 Hey!
 No idea, but I'm pretty sure I'm overdressed...Still standing?
 Yeah, I kinda went off a bit. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.
 I got this back, Elena. 
 Hello...
 No catch, brother. Drink up. It's on me.
 Hi Callie.
 You been on this "bunny diet" for a better part of 50 years. So, how is it that "Saint Stefan", of all people, is good at a drinking game?
 Hmm...
 All that effort wasted trying to tell you how boring you are, and now you finally agree with me?
 I happen to like the edge, Stefan! Your problem is your inability to resist falling over it. All or nothing, man. You can't just be.
 Although, who am I to judge? 
 Nothing to see here! 
 Two more!
 I thought you could use a hug, Stefan.
 Maybe I wanted to remind you what freedom was like, before Klaus took it from you.
 That's my point, Stefan. You've given up! Now you could sit around and be his little bitch, or you get mad enough and you can do something about it.
 I really hope this game of twenty questions isn't your secret weapon.
 Well, Klaus has been running for about thousand years, so if you think you can get a work around here...
 
 I'll give you ten points for flair.
 Don't think you had to wait till the last second to have your breakthrough, though.
 Oooo, Ooooo, my brother is about to die and I just had to save his life for the bajillionith time! Careful Stefan, your humanity is showing. 
 
 Because I have to, Stefan! Because you are in this mess with Klaus, because you saved my life. Because I owe you. And I can't just leave you in a cell to rot.
 We got Mikael.
 No idea. I guess Katherine came through. Plan's in motion. See, I told you I had it. Go ahead. Kick, yell, scream. Sure you've been planning your rant all day.
 Why not? I went behind you back. Freed Stefan. And you know what? It backfired. He's an even bigger dick than ever...just now, he's a dick that's on our side.
 
 So I was right. After all that, the wall lead us to Mikael.
 Really? What 'd you learn from her?
 Well, you should tell that to my brother.
 
 No, we vervained him! This guy is an Original. To make it realistic.
 Good point! You my brother have been compelled to do what Klaus says. So the idea is to lure him back here and kill him...last thing we need is you getting tripped up and tongue-tied.
 Now- was that easy or what?
 Oh really? Cause these Original vampires are usually so reliable.
 Her lying, mama- killing, dagger- happy brother. Wolfsbane is ready.
 Well, I am formulating a secret contingency plan.
 Well, if I told you, then it wouldn't be a secret.
 You have your own ties.
 Ah- ah! No!
 Elena! If this thing blows up in our face- just remember  only one of us heals quickly.
 Never your mind, brother. The less you know the better.
 In the back! Harsh!
 Hey, I'm not judging you. It's very- "Katherine" of you.
 It was a compliment. Sort of...
 Elena, you just daggered somebody. You will be fine.
 If it makes you feel any better, she's not really dead.
 No.
 No. Not as long as he is under Klaus's control.
 I know what to do. Your just not gonna like it.
 Because when this all goes down, I don't want you having any part of it.
 Do you trust me?
 Then you have nothing to worry about.
 Yep, you missed the photo op. Did you get the stake?
 I'm not gonna take your word for it. No offense to your honor and all...
 Fancy. May I?
 I'd offer you a drink- but Katherine tells me you're more of a "vampire on the rocks" kind of guy.
 Why feed on vampires? Don't tell me it's for the smooth after taste.
 Didn't depend on that.
 Oh, yeah. We have a plan, right. Just doesn't involve you.
 You couldn't just break his neck?
 Here's my RSVP.
 "Hybrid".
 As the host you should know these hybrids don't make the best first impression.
 Tell someone who cares.
 What the hell is wrong with you? You weren't suppose to witchy migraine me!
 He tried to bite me!
 Nothing.
 Shh. 
 Because I'm the only one who can get inside the house!
 What are you doing?!
 What the hell did you do?
 We thought of everything, Elena! Klaus having hybrids. Mikael turning on us. We brought in Katherine so you weren't in danger. Anything that could have gone wrong we were prepared!
 We blew it.
 She ran for the hills like usual, the minute things got bad! And who blames her?! Klaus would've crushed her. I had him, Elena. I had Klaus! This could have all been over!!!
 We're never getting Stefan back. You know that, don't you?
 Not interested in the play-by-play of our failure right now, Katherine.
 That's not very comforting at the moment. You're going back into hiding?
 Take care of yourself, Katherine.
 Oh, I give you a choice. Bloody Mary or Screwdriver. Brunch in a bottle. Come on Ric, I can't drink all this by myself. I mean I can but then somebody's getting naked.
 Oh man I can't believe you're making me drink alone.
 It's the eve of Klaus-ageddon. You're doing homework?
 Kids today...Where are their values?
 Ohh, somebody's getting grounded.
 Oops.
 You are feisty when you are mad.
 But why? He lost his job at the Grill. He can survive, Elena.
 It's typical teenager.
 Not everyone. He still has you.
 What makes you think I'm not okay?
 Hmm- what is my most attractive look?
 Noted. See if I can make any improvements.
 You gonna do this in the Grill? In front of everyone? It's a little beneath you, don't you think?
 I'm surprised you stuck around town long enough for happy hour.
 Cute blonde bombshell, psycho. Shouldn't be too hard to find.
 Stefan skipped town the second he saved your ass.
 I'd say we're overdue.
 You know me. Never miss a chance to plan an epic failure.
 Well, I did have a front row seat when your sister lied to you.
 That's the thing with younger siblings. You just never know what they're gonna do.
 Drink?
 Down the hatch.
 Really? Well, yeah. Maybe we can bond over our mutual loathing of my brother. Why are you so mad at him? He stole something?
 Of course he did. Such a buzzkill, my baby bro. Well, I'd love to find him. Just the trouble is, I sure as hell don't work for you.
 How is he?
 Jeremy, why aren't you wearing vervain? Where is your bracelet?
 Klaus is trying to send us a message. He wants us to find Stefan who stole his coffins full of his dead family members.
 Yep! So all we have to do is find four coffins and voilà! No one else on your family's Christmas list needs to die!
 You got a better idea?
 No! No!!! I know what you're thinking. The answer is no!
 Yeah, then Klaus undaggers her, first thing she does is kill you! Frying pan, fire. Not an option!
 I thought Bonnie said this place lost all its mojo.
 I hate witches. So fickle...Passive-aggressive...
 Come on, Stef. Olly olly oxen free. 
 Really?! Still?!
 Witchy spirits aren't a big fan. And they use their juju to screw with my daylight ring!
 Elena...!
 That didn't go over well.
 Let me talk to him!
 Here. Take my car keys. You go deal with your brother, I'll deal with mine.
 
 Nothing's ever easy with you, is it?
 That is for screwing up my plan! You stop me from killing Klaus and you steal his family! Why?? Doesn't make sense! Answer me!!
 But I had him, Stefan! Why did you screw it up?
 What?? No. No way! You didn't do this for me.
 When are you going to get it through your head?
 Stop saving me!!
 Do you know what I can't figure out? Why save me? Was it brotherly love, guilty conscience? Is the switch on, is the switch off?
 Reflection. That's not gonna work on me! I invented that.
 Not until you told me why you saved me. You owe me that.
 Fine. Next question. Why did you steal the coffins?
 Use against him to do what? You're not gonna kill him, you know how I know? 'Cause there was only one way to kill him and you blew that to save me.
 Fair enough. But whatever you're doing I want in.
 Really? Last time I checked you're hiding in a haunted house.
 You're go after Klaus you have to be cutthroat and devious. I'm so much better at that than you. Come on brother. What do you say? If you're gonna keep saving my life at least make it for a good reason.
 Yeah.
 Deal!
 Wait. I'm not so...welcome in there.
 What? Klaus is allergic to dust?
 So even if he comes in the house...
 Yeah. Tony the headless hybrid is down at the bottom of Steven's Quarry.
 Took care of him, too. He'll be fine. How are you?
 Elena. Look at me. It's gonna be okay.
 What? No. No, no, no you did not do that. She's gonna come here and try and kill you!
 And suddenly you trust him??
 My brother is- sort of running his own show right now.
 Elena.
 We will! Hey...Elena. Hey. We will. Okay?
 Your sister thinks we should have another one of our talks.
 Here's the thing, Jer. You're gonna go out of town for a while- a long while. You're gonna stay with some nice family friends in Denver, you're gonna be at a new school, you'll meet new girls, living girls. You're going to drink a few beers, take an art class. You do whatever you want.
 You're gonna leave Mystic Falls behind and never think twice about it. You're gonna have a better life, Jeremy.
 You just saved his life, Elena. Take it from me, strange is bad, dead is worse.
 He found out. And he got over it. Again  not dead, Elena! He's so lucky to have you for his sister.
 No problem.
 You should know this, Elena. Stefan didn't screw us over. He screwed us over but he had a good reason.
 He saved Klaus to save me. Then he stole the coffins to get even.
 What's it even mean?.....Means I'm an idiot. 'Cause I thought for one second that I wouldn't have to feel guilty anymore.
 For wanting what I want.
 I know. Believe me, I get it...Brother's girl and all.
 No!! No, you know what? If I'm gonna feel guilty about something, I'm gonna feel guilty about this.
 Good night.
 Good morning.
 Relax, brother. You don't want your hair to fall out.
 No reason. Be with you in a minute.
 No, I said I wouldn't.
 Why are you asking?
 These hybrids, really bringing the neighborhood down.
 Yeah. Any sign of our little hybrid buddies?
 Alright, Klaus has 6 siblings. Rebekah is now with Klaus. There was one dead kid in the old world, one dead kid in the new world, which leaves Elijah and two others. Three sleeping originals, four coffins. So, who is in the locked box?
 Oh, you think the spirits of a bunch of dead witches that can make the coffins invisible would have figured out how to open one. 
 Oh yeah, that's a great idea Stefan. Why don't you just ask them to pack their bags and take a long rest while we are at it. How about try to keep the peace? Don't attract attention to the real thing we are trying to hide.
 And then he kills you and everyone you know like, I don't know...me!
 You sure about that?
 The only way to call someones bluff, Stefan, is to be willing to lose everything if you're wrong.
 He did.
 It seems so.
 I think there is another option at play, a dimmer switch, which is a huge problem.
 Because I can't predict how far he is willing to go until someone gets killed.
 
 Screw you!
 That's the bridge where Elena and Jeremy's parents died in the car accident.
 Well I'm sure it starts with a "Stef" and ends with an "an". I'm gonna get a drink, write a check and then we're out?
 Look at what the cat dragged in. Nice vest.
 Carol, don't take this the wrong way, but do you realize that you've been kissing the ass of an immortal hybrid who ruined your son's life?
 From who? His hybrids are the one the town needs protection from.
 Not gonna happen.
 You've gotta be kidding me!
 Oh, please don't tell me you're gonna drink the Klaus Kool-Aid.
 Liz, I'm impressed, you're all strong and sheriff-y.
 What are you doing? No dead hybrids at the Founders' party!
 You don't think there's ten more where that came from? And if you kill them, Klaus won't make 20 more? Have you forgotten about Elena's part in all of this? Or do you not care if she is a human blood bag for the rest of her life?
 Don't give me that no-humanity crap, you can't just flip your switch! Your switch is fried, Stefan, just like your brain! You wanna take Klaus? You wannao beat the villain? You've gotta be smarter.
 Why the hell do you have Elena's phone?
 Stefan, leave her out of this.
 Stefan just grabbed Elena.
 He's gonna try and use her against you. Do what he says, get rid of your hybrids.
 You sure about that? He just tried to behead someone in the middle of a Council party. He's operating on crazy right now.
 Maybe he is, maybe he isn't but if you don't want to believe him, believe me. I know my brother better than anyone, and right now, I don't have a clue how far he is willing to take this. So if he says blink, I suggest you blink.
 Anytime. You gonna be okay?
 You know, Stefan won this round for us today. He pushed Klaus to the edge and Klaus blinked.
 Still, we needed it. Klaus has been calling all the shots, and Stefan beat him at his own game. He was the better villain.
 Well, I can't help but be a little proud. Really, tell me, are you gonna be okay?
 I know.
 It's right. Just not right now. Good night.
 Another hybrid?
 What's with the stake? He's not a vampire.
 Sooner. Abby Bennett Wilson, Monroe, North Carolina. Born in Mystic Falls Hospital, graduated at Mystic Falls High...blah blah blah.
 A little compulsion helps sped up the research process.
 Yep. Road trip. I call shotgun.
 Want me to hang out in the back with you?
 Why? I'm the one who found her.
 We kissed. Now it's weird. Have a great trip.
 Who's that?
 She's a doctor?
 What's the damage?
 Come on, Ric, a fact of life. A girl that hot, that smart...damage.
 Yeah, but it comes from her ex, doesn't count.
 That's yours.
 Nothing. They're all dead.
 She dated the medical examiner?
 Well, I don't think he's dead adjacent, I think he's just dead.
 Murdered. Sheriff is trying to keep a lid on it because he was staked in the chest like a vampire.
 Well, red flag number two.
 I don't know but if I was a cop, your sexy doctor lady friend would definitely be a suspect.
 You know, we never got a chance to official meet, Doctor...Fell.
 Strolling the halls. You know, I like to wave to newborns through the window.
 I'm sorry about your boyfriend. Animal attack. Brutal.
 Yeah, I'm sure. You know, I just thought I come by and tell you, that it wasn't an animal attack.
 But then I realized. You signed the death certificate.
 Wasn't he the guy, that coined the phrase animal attack?
 Because Ric likes you. And if you are a psychopath that would really suck for him,
 I think psychopaths are incredible high-maintenance.
 Fair enough.
 Ehm...Looking for a bunny. You're good. For now.
 Uh ah ah! Do ten more of those. You're gonna wanna buff up, if you start dating this one. Self-defense and all.
 Your doctor vervained me and then she bloodjacked me.
 When I went to the hospital, to accuse her of killing her ex-boyfriend. Which by the way, very sensitive subject.
 Why are you mad at me?
 I proved your theory...diagnosed psycho case. You're welcome.
 Insulting a bunch of dead witches...not smart. I made the exact same mistake first time I came in here.
 Well, here's the thing. They can't. It's not here.
 Well, Bonnie gave me the heads-up. I didn't have enough time, to get all four, but I did have time to get one.
 Sorry. The same rules apply. You know, leverage and all. I know you want your family back. But something tells me, you want what's in that coffin a lot more.
 Don't look so happy, I was only able to get one of them out in time. The locked one.
 Yeah. You know, if you're banking on Bonnie's momma to open it, you're screwed. She doesn't have any powers.
 Is Elena okay?
 I take it you two had a heart-to-heart. And I take it, you don't wanna talk about it. Noted. So why don't we talk about this?
 So you're the prime suspect, huh?
 Well why don't you just ask Ric if his dirty little doctor had access to the weapons.
 I'm just sayin' first suspects usually the right one. Don't get so defensive.
 But Brian Walters was her ex-boyfriend and Ric saw them fighting that night.
 Who else knows about your secret little slayer stash?
 It's Klaus. It has to be, he's screwing with us.
 Ahh, make's me nostalgic for the time when Stefan was a bunny snacking pacifist, anyway got to go, you'll know more later.
 Tea with an old friend.
 Elijah. My favorite Original, back from the dead. Clean up nice.
 Oh, yeah. "Dear Elijah, let's get together, plot the destruction of your brother, XOXO".
 Was I right to undagger you or are we gonna have a problem?
 I'll start with an easy question. Any idea what kind of Klaus-killing weapon could be magically sealed in a mystery coffin?
 Get dressed. We're going out.
 I didn't ask. Elijah and I have scheduled a very old-fashioned sit-down with you and Klaus. I say go with the black. Makes you look all villainy.
 He didn't have to. All we're doing is buying a little time to give our wicked witches a chance to pop the top off the coffin.
 If you didn't go postal on his hybrids, then maybe we'd have some options.
 Undaggering Elijah was smart, Stefan. Are you kidding me? After what Klaus did to him? He's in vengeance mode. It's perfect.
 Yeah, the way you've been acting, I trust him about as much as I trust you.
 Oh, yes...this is about me kissing Elena. Just remember, if it wasn't for Klaus, you would have never become such a dick and that kiss would never have happened. So get ready and get happy. We're going to negotiate a fake truce and I don't want your attitude screwing it up.
 Thank you, love.
 Eat. I thought we agreed that we would leave the grumpy Stefan at home.
 Well, I know how he felt about you, so I figured the more, the merrier.
 Hey, Stef, remember when you killed dad? Might want to dial down the judgment until dessert.
 I'm just saying we have a long evening ahead of us. Pace yourself.
 You know what, probably best just to keep Elena in the do-not-discuss pile.
 Yeah.
 Well, we're not going anywhere Elijah. Please, do tell.
 That's very simple. Klaus gets his coffin back, in exchange, he and the Original extended family leave Mystic Falls forever. Me, Stefan, and Elena live happily ever after. No grudges.
 I'm gonna get some air.
 What do you say, Klaus? It's time for you to put something on the table. We've made our offer, now you counter.
 Matt Donovan? Really?
 What are you doing?
 What are you doing?
 Stop!
 I'll get it.
 Wow, actual acknowledgement of a job well done. You're going soft, Stefan.
 Shut up, you don't get to thank me until I pay you back for all those times you've saved me.
 I didn't do it on your account.
 So do I.
 Let's hope big witch and little witch got that coffin open.
 Mama's still breathing, I can hear her.
 Well, it's not gonna do us any good. Whatever was in it is gone.
 What? How is she even alive? Thought her hybrid freak show of a son ripped her heart out a thousand years ago.
 Anyone else feeling a little used right now?
 What is it?
 It's not bad enough they're moving into town, now they want a housewarming gift?
 Well that's a dumb idea, she already tried to kill you once.
 Can we go back in time where the old Stefan cared if Elena lived or died?
 You can't protect yourself.
 You've pissed off enough Originals to last a lifetime. I'll go.
 End of story.
 Hello Carol.
 Hanging out with your new besties?
 Hmm, Well at least you know who you're borrowing that cup of sugar from.
 Damon Salvatore. Have we met?
 Excuse me, Carol.
 Surprise, surprise. Nice tux. You're not supposed to be here.
 Do you see who I see?
 Don't even think about it.
 Well sucks to be her then. Was I not clear this morning?
 You have to tell me before you walk into a lion's den.
 Uhh...Yes!
 It would be rude not to dance, you know.
 You look stunning, if it isn't obvious.
 Stop staring. It's creepy.
 Well, you're no dog yourself.
 Heh. You tried to kill Elena last night. You don't get compliments.
 Where is Elena?
 Got your text. What are we doing in here?
 Where's Elena?
 What did you do?
 Wait. Hang on. I'm the problem here?
 I'm trying to keep her alive, Stefan.
 My emotions? How is this even happening right now?
 Elena. Did you get what you want?
 Good, tell me on the ride home. We're leaving. Come on.
 There shouldn't have been a plan. You shouldn't be here.
 Sorry for trying to keep you alive. Clearly Stefan doesn't give a crap anymore.
 No, I'm mad at you because I love you!
 No, I got it, Elena. I care too much. I'm a liability. How ironic is that?
 Hey, hey, hey, hey!
 Easy on the hand. Guy's a quarterback.
 Maybe a little. 
 Burn. Rejected by the captain of the football team. Welcome to adolescence.
 Well...never let people tell you what to do.
 Besides...you would have broken him in a second.
 No. I'm just saying that you should find someone a little more durable. That's all.
 What?
 Sorry, I've been busy.
 Oh, I'm over it.
 My thoughts exactly.
 Let's not hold our breath.
 You think Rebekah had to compel me?
 Can we just move pass that, Elena?
 Well, maybe, for once, something I did had nothing to do with you.
 Well, that's great! Klaus will finally be dead. We win. Why do you look like someone just shot a panda bear?
 I'm supposed to care about Elijah?
 Two seconds ago, you were pissed that she attacked you. It's a win-win.
 Don't do anything to screw this up, Elena.
 See? It's democracy in action.
 Join me for a little victory drink?
 Why are you so extra broody? Did you see the way we stood up to Elena? I like you on my team. Must have driven her nuts.
 I think somebody needs to talk to her. She's not gonna listen to anything I say.
 It's not my fault she decided to get jealous.
 Whatever. Did you a favor. Now you can come in and sweep her off her feet.
 Fine. Neither one of us gets her. Just make sure she doesn't screw up Esther's plan.
 Well she's not answering her phone.
 Ugh...she told you?!
 Oh, really? Did she also tell you that she's having an attack of conscience about this whole Original murder thing?
 Well, you don't have to judge her. Just tie her up, lock her in her room, till this is over.
 Busy doing what?
 Are you with the sexy, psycho doctor?
 He has Elena.
 I'm a little embarrassed to admit, but when it comes to killing thousand year old resurrected witches, I'm a little rusty.
 Yeah, he means. 
 Oh, how super specific of you.
 Clock's ticking. You gonna help me brainstorm a plan or are you too busy fixing yourself a snack?
 A. What if she's with Esther? B. What if she can't cut her off? C. I don't know how any of this stuff works and D. neither do you!
 Worst case scenario, simple mechanics. Can't draw power from a dead battery.
 If it comes to that.
 Well, what if I told you I had a less diabolical plan.
 They're all linked. One goes down, they all go down. The witches live, Elena's safe, problem solved.
 Ironically, Klaus isn't our current problem.
 Well, I just so happen to know someone crazy enough to give it a shot.
 Good. It'll be easier if they're wasted.
 Divide and conquer. First, we'll need a little blonde distraction.
 Tell your sexy doctor "Good work"!
 Do it. It's not going to stop Esther from killing you.
 You didn't know I was friends with your mummy? Yeah, we have a lot in common. She hates you as much as I do.
 You told me we had until after nine.
 So how do we know they're going to be at the Old Witch House?
 You know, if we sit this out, Esther completes her spell, Klaus dies, you get your revenge. It's what you wanted the whole time. The only collateral damage is....
 You know what she'd choose.
 Yep.
 Well, she'll hate us. Thing is, she only has to hate one of us. Only one of us has to do the actual deed.
 Well, heads I do it, tails you do it.
 Pot, kettle, brother.
 This will only hurt a second.
 Is she safe?
 Good. All's right in the world again.
 Cause I'm not blind. I see what's been going on around here. You're hanging by a thread, Stefan. Barely over your last ripper binge and all you want is to be the old Stefan again.
 Oh yeah? How long has it been since you've had a drop of human blood?
 Spend 146 years with someone, you kind of start to pick up on their tells. Answer the question. How long has it been since your last drink?
 See? You have enough to feel guilty about! Why add to the list? By the way, you're welcome.
 I do. And I thought I could win her from you fair and square. She didn't want me. It's for the best. I'm better at being the bad guy anyway.
 You're arresting him for what this nut job Dr. Fell says?
 Are we gonna ignore the part where he is one of the killer's victims? I mean, the guy was practically stabbed to death.
 Well then we'll find some.
 Listen, Liz...
 Ric's fine. Sheriff wants me to stay out of it.
 Seems just as good a plan as any.
 Well, I guess I could rip out Dr. False Accusation's throat. Maybe her tongue. You know, I could chew it up into little tiny pieces and feed it to the squirrels.
 Guess me staying out of it suddenly sounds like a good idea, doesn't it? I saved your life last night. You're welcome.
 I know, you're right, her and her mom must be really hurting right now. Should I send lasagna?
 I'm mean, you hate me. The Earth is back on its axis.
 Dear diary, a chipmunk asked me my name today. I told him it was Joe. That lie will haunt me forever.
 I was hoping we could hang. You know a little brother bonding. I know we don't actually "hang out". We team up, we join forces, we activate our wonder twin powers.
 Digging up clues. Most of the Originals are gone, but now we have a whodunnit in town. Hey, do you remember when we came back for Zachariah's funeral?
 If memory serves, he wasn't the first Founders' Council member killed that year or even that month.
 I'm trying to remember what year it was.
 So much for vaguely.
 1912. Or as I like to call it  last time Mystic Fall's had a serial killer on its hands.
 Have you been eating the relatives again?
 It's been a long time, brother.
 And miss the funeral of, what do you call him? Uncle Zachariah?
 Why would I be mad at you, Stefan? You made me become a vampire and now I walk the world alone, drinking other people's blood.
 If I'm not mistaken, you were the one who killed our family, remember? May father rest in peace.
 Well congratulations, Stefan. But if you'll excuse me, I'd like to live out my eternal existence as far away from you as possible.
 Sure. Why not?
 What do you say, brother? You wanna go get drunk?
 Well, there's that and I was hoping you could help me solve a murder.
 Oh, She-Devil at nine o'clock.
 So what does a medical examiner, Bill Forbes, and Alaric Saltzman have in common?
 Come on, knock it off.
 You know, quitting blood cold turkey after a ripper binge might not be the best approach. Every time you play that all-or-nothing game, you eventually leave a trail of bodies. So, I'm thinking, now is a good time to pay our old friend moderation a visit.
 But why them? Huh? Brian Walters and Alaric weren't from founding families. I mean, hey, if you're gonna slaughter council members, go A-list. At least in 1912 they killed a Salvatore.
 Well, our father knocked up one of the maids during the Civil War, she had a son. But as far as everyone else knew, Stefan and I were dead. Family name had to go somewhere.
 You're full of a lot of questions.
 You know you don't have to disguise your true motives Blondie-Bex, if you want more sex, just ask for it.
 Oh, come on, it was too good for you to be this hostile.
 You'll have to excuse my little brother, he's jonesing for some O positive.
 Nope. Wrote it all off on vampires.
 Don't think for a second you didn't cross my mind too, brother. But these murders weren't your style, were they? Plus there were no other vampires circulating then.
 Ohh, right, Sage. Speaking of great sex. Ooh!
 Hit a man when he's down.
 You do not get to lecture me on how to live my life. Not any more.
 Not interested.
 Afraid you have me all wrong.
 You really think it was Sage who was killing all those Founders back then?
 Easy there, lushy pants. It's been a hoot and a half but it's boy's night and you weren't invited.
 So, let's just say Sage was killing everyone in 1912. Who the hell is doing it now? It's not that psycho, Dr. Fell. She's a woman. There's no way she could stab three grown men.
 He's on a master cleanse. Trying to be a better man and all.
 Don't rile him up.
 He's testy when he's being self-righteous.
 Oh, okay, fair enough. My mistake. 
 I wasn't. The woman I was in love with was stuck in a tomb and she wasn't getting out for a hundred years. I wasn't having any fun at all.
 I was hungry. Now I am not hungry. My quality of form is purely subjective.
 I do not need a woman for pleasure. I am spoken for.
 What if they don't?
 How did you know her?
 What? Creepy suicidal guy?
 You're doing it again.
 Sure. First, admit you're jonesing.
 Admit it.
 Because I'm feeling a little self-righteous too.
 Ah, he's an eternally guilty conscious.
 Oh, on the contrary, he's determined to live his life pursuing one extreme or the other. He's a stubborn one, my brother. Uh, think I'm gonna need some help with this one.
 Hello.
 This may seem very forward but you're just so pretty.
 And please don't scream. You're about to have a very, very bad night.
 Sorry brother. It's dinner time. Have a bite.
 Tough love, Stefan. You're not gonna survive this cold turkey thing, you never do. It's time to get that monkey off your back.
 Feed or I'll let Rebekah have her way with her. You know she'll kill her.
 Then her blood will be on your hands. Or you could just have a little drink, save her life. Come on, Stefan. You were the one that said you didn't want any more innocent lives slaughtered. Save her. Go on, have a bite. I snatched, you eat, I'll erase. Hell, I'll even heal her for you.
 Because you let it control you. You always have. I'm just here to help you learn how to fight it.
 I got it from here. Go ahead.
 Scram. No one likes a lurker.
 So I'm told.
 Alright, that's enough. Come on. You're gonna bleed her dry. You're gonna drain her. Come on.
 I said that's enough! Hey, you wanna fight hunger or do you wanna fight me?
 I got you. That's a good girl.
 Relax, Elena. Just a little experiment. There's no need to make this more dramatic than it needs to be.
 So...that's gonna take a little time.
 Stefan, hey wait, Stefan. Wait!
 They let Ric go. Sheriff Forbes says she's out of suspects again, but Ric is in the clear. I know it may not seem like it, but you did really well tonight. And before you know it you're gonna be the king of moderation. Elena will understand.
 Uh-uh, none of that. No more no-humanity Stefan. There's a road called recovery and we are on it.
 Can you for one minute actually believe that I'm trying to help you?
 You don't need my....Are you kidding me? Do you remember what happened last time you said that?
 1912, Stefan. The last time I convinced you to drink human blood.
 Go ahead, Stefan, pick one.
 Yes, they are people, Stefan. People with blood pumping through their veins, waiting to be opened up and sucked dry. You've just forgotten how good it feels.
 Not him, Stefan, not him. 
 But you can, Stefan, we can. Let the past be the past. Have a drink with me, brother.
 I knew you still had it in you.
 Don't be greedy.
 Stefan...Stefan.
 Stefan, stop. Stefan, stop.
 Stefan..
 Shh, Stefan.
 You just need to learn how to stop. I can help you.
 The Founders' Council killer had nothing on you. By the decade's end, they were calling you the Ripper of Monterrey. I let you walk away. I watched you go over the edge, I didn't do anything to stop you.
 Sure I could've. But I just didn't want to. But I want to now. And whenever you go too far, I will be there to pull you back. Every second, every day, till you don't need me.
 'Cause right now, you're all I got.
 So now you want to be helpful?
 What'd you find?
 They did? Who?
 Then what?
 Samantha Gilbert. That is very weird.
 Because I'm pretty sure I had already killed her.
 It's not possible, if she became a vampire, we'd know about it, right?
 Yeah, but even if she had a ring, she wouldn't be alive today. Doesn't protect her from old age.
 Alaric's.
 You ready to ditch this House of Horrors? Oof, you look terrible.
 Don't worry about him, take him out for chicken soup, get him a martini, make sure he doesn't kill anybody.
 Oh right, I thought we were talking about Alaric, but of course we're talking about Stefan.
 I didn't let him do anything, if you want to get nit-picky about it, I made him.
 Because we're vampires, Elena. We need human blood to survive. We're predators, not puppies.
 Stefan has built himself a delusional wagon which he has repeatedly fallen off of. What he needs to learn is control.
 Ah, yes, back when you two were in love and it was all rainbows and unicorns.
 Rebekah's up to something. She's been snooping around in places she shouldn't be.
 Ric, the world can't stop just because you're an accidental psycho killer.
 I'm gonna stick around for a bit.
 Blast from the past.
 Sage, my hottest teacher. What are you doing here?
 Oh, come on, nobody just passes through Mystic Falls.
 Easy there, Rebekah. You know she use to beat men for sport.
 Finn, really?
 Not unless you count hate sex.
 Ah, she's just lurking around because she wants something from me. Can't figure out what it is though.
 Cause it's impossible. She's too strong.
 Sage, she's an Original. It's not gonna happen.
 Did I ever tell you you're sexy when you're bitchy?
 Oh, but that was brother business, you can't hold that against me. Besides I really did appreciate your help even if I don't show it.
 You like mean.
 No? You didn't get a thrill back there pushing Sage down, crushing her dreams of true love?
 See? Mean. Can Sage and I interest you in a drink back at the house?
 Well, you know what they say  two's company, three's a party.
 Fine.
 Enjoy the rest of your day.
 Oh, come on. Slow down, brother.
 Whoa. Control, remember? Doesn't matter whether it's blondes or blood bags, same principles apply.
 Oh, you're stress eating. Sublimating. You two deserve each other with all your pining and moping.
 I told her what she already knows. You're a vampire and you drink human blood and to get over it.
 Which is the same thing I'm telling you. Own it, live it, love it. Stop being ashamed of who you are.
 Gladly. Now, unless you're interested in a Sage-Rebekah sex sandwich, I suggest you make yourself scarce.
 All right Miss Master Seductress, where's our victim?
 Finn's gone, you know.
 He strung you along for 900 years, didn't bother to call, he's gone.
 Yes, he was. Hope's a bitch, Sage. Get out while you can.
 How bout a duet?
 I don't want her. I want you.
 I take it back, your plan is amazing.
 Well, are you gonna torture me or are you gonna tell me what she's up to?
 There's another tree.
 Our family made one of its many fortunes selling lumber. It's why Rebekah's been digging around about this stuff. That tree was on our land and milled by our yard. The ledgers will tell me where it was shipped. Business archives should be around here somewhere. Get upstairs, make sure you keep her distracted.
 You gotta be kidding me!
 Happy, I hope.
 Yep. 1912, the Salvatore milling company chopped down a forest, its most valuable wood came an old white oak tree that was used to make the Wickery Bridge. These aren't public records, so Rebekah's gonna chase her tail for a long time.
 Yep.
 Why? Because of your true love Finn? Let me tell you something, I met the guy, you're not gonna miss him.
 Alright, let's make a deal. You let me kill Rebekah, I consider Finn untouchable, you guys walk into the sunset together.
 Yes. It's a promise.
 Sage, let's go, we have Originals to kill.
 Sage.
 You set me up.
 I told you I'd save your creepy boyfriend!
 I should end you.
 Let me tell you something, your long lost love has a suicide wish. Cause when mama witch linked them together in a spell he's the one that volunteered to die.
 He didn't want to live. Not for you. Not for anyone. He doesn't love you, Sage. Now, when I do find another way to kill those Originals, I'll start with Finn.
 Just making sure the witch didn't turn you into a toad or a block of salt. Bonnie did a little spell, it's nothing to worry about, it's just something to keep the killer in you at bay.
 Let's just say you've got an alter ego hell-bent on killing Council members. So we're gonna pack up some of your stuff, we're gonna go to the loft, just for a little bit. You know it's like house arrest. Polite.
 She'll be fine, Ric.
 Little early in the day for you, isn't it?
 To what?
 If you're happy, I'm happy.
 You know, Stefan, I'm a philanthropist, I make the world a better place. Restoring bridges, landmarks, and...
 Historical signs made of the same white oak as the Wickery Bridge.
 I sold my rage. Whew! You should have seen me.
 Game's back on, brother. Let's go kill some Originals.
 Morning sunshine.
 Indecent, but fine.
 Nope. Slept like a baby, woke up Alaric. No head minds about dead Council members.
 Well, maybe because you're being all paranoid and control freaky. What'd you bring me?
 Ooo, chocolate muffins. You know what they say; a way to a psycho killer's heart is through his stomach.
 Fine. Keep convincing yourself you're still mad at me. But sadly, Ric's gonna have to miss Elena time today. You know lockdown and all.
 With pleasure.
 Have a great day, thanks for coming by.
 Walking down the stairs, opening the front door, and she's gone.
 I got it.
 I said I got it. Stop micromanaging.
 No you don't.
 If you wanted to turn yourself in, you wouldn't be saying it out loud. Just saying.
 His morals get very questionable when he has revenge on the brain.
 Here's your ring, Ric. Put it on.
 It's also the reason you're alive. You're going vampire hunting, Ric. Wear it.
 We found some more white oak. Long story, wait for the movie.
 Scenario number one.
 You get to play Klaus.
 Because he's obsessed with you.
 But for right now we need you to play Rebekah. We use the quarterback to distract her. Just keep her talking.
 Act interested. She's lonely, desperate.
 Hm. Beefcake holds bombshell. I come up from behind her. 
 No last minute attacks of pity for any of them. 
 Barbie?
 Busboy?
 Good point.
 Why? Where'd you put yours?
 What the hell was that?
 Ric?
 You've got to admit, even for me, it's a little kinky.
 You want to compel me to be your boyfriend?
 What are you doing here? Rebekah will kill you.
 Open them. Carefully.
 Don't be an idiot, Elena.
 Uh, you bitch.
 Actually, I was having a pretty good time in there.
 Oh, come on, I couldn't have hurt you that bad. You didn't really think I had a thing for you, did you?
 I get it. If Klaus bossed me around for a thousand years, I'd probably be pretty desperate for attention too.
 This was much different in my head.
 Stefan, what are you doing?
 No.
 Eleven.
 Yeah, for now. I need your stake.
 A bookshelf, really? At least I was trying to be clever about it.
 Ha ha ha. Look harder, Ric.
 Maybe you just forgot which shelf you put it on.
 Who else did you tell, Ric?!
 What?
 No. Are you telling me that your vampire hating alter ego has a stake that can kill an entire line of vampires, possibly mine??
 You hear from Klaus?
 Well, that's gonna be disappointing for him.
 I like that confidence, Stefan. I don't share it, but I like it.
 Well, you're good Stefan again. You're in control. Sorry, you might get the girl but you lose the edge. Speaking of...
 Have you ever flown first class?
 Pft, please. I use miles.
 Next time we compel him, remind me to make him better at baseball.
 Katherine sired us, Rose sired Katherine, all we need to do is find out who sired Rose.
 Dead vampire is redundant, but yes.
 What good is you dying and coming back to life if you can't talk to a ghost when I need you to?
 No, but it'll give us a head start. Okay, come on.
 For the record, she's the one who wanted to stay in a motel, not me.
 Corner of somewhere and nowhere where Kol can't find us.
 Well, didn't you find it weird that you made a friend so fast? Have you met you?
 Alright Whoopi, what do you need? 
 I know, I know. They push from the other side and you pull from this one.
 Picture? What, a trip to Disneyland? Come on Rose, you're not gonna actually make us wait, are you? I know you're obsessed with me.
 Um, well she does this little thing with her tongue.
 She spent her last day in paradise. Soaking in the sun and reminiscing about what it means to be human. And when death came, she didn't fear it.
 Is she still hot?
 Uh, Scary Mary. Well, where is she, Rose?
 There you are. Any sign of Evil-laric?
 What?
 Kol must have told him we were in Denver. How long has Ric been out?
 And if not?
 Yeah, no answers yet. So, we're just stuck in this motel until she gets back to us.
 Yeah, we had to get away from Kol. I'll call you when I know more.
 Everything okay in here?
 Okay, well, I'm gonna freshen up. You might want to get some rest. I'm sure Rose will make herself known when she gets back.
 It wasn't about you.
 Because when people see good, they expect good. 
 Why not? Elena...
 Okay then. Let's go.
 Looks about right.
 Don't be a dick. Listen to your sister.
 Thank you. Come on.
 Oof, like Vampire Hoarders.
 Scary Mary. She's really old, super creepy.
 I dated her.
 What? I said creepy, not ugly.
 Mary.
 Elena, get out of here!
 Don't touch her.
 Yeah.
 That's better.
 Are you okay? You're bleeding.
 What are you doing?
 Well, this trip and you kissing me. What the hell is this?
 Do you?
 Hm. I guess you thought this little trip could help you figure that out, didn't you?
 Or maybe you were hoping I'd screw it up, so I could just make the decision for you, am I wrong?
 Am I wrong??
 What if I didn't? What if there was no bump?
 I'm sorry, Elena. This time I'm not gonna make it so easy for you. This time you'll have to figure it out for yourself.
 Where've you been? I've been calling you all day.
 So I take it Rebekah got the stake?
 Lovely. What now?
 I don't know if right now is the best time for you to be going on a spirit quest, Ric.
 I'm thinking gardenia corsage. Wrist obviously, you don't want to accidentally stab her in the chest with the pin. Now, that could get messy.
 Oh, come on, it's a little funny.
 I need medical advice. For a friend. Alaric, you remember him, right? About six foot two. Tried to hack you into pieces.
 I don't know. 
 We three need to talk.
 We tried medicine, we tried magic.
 What? To pretend to be Alaric? The guy that we know is gone. We're talking about someone who not only hates vampires, but vampire sympathizers. Which makes one of his most obvious targets  I don't know, you! 
 I'm suggesting that we put him out of his misery.
 Oh come on, It's what he would want. It's a mercy killing.
 We're trapped here.
 Sorry to spoil your seven minutes in heaven. We have a problem.
 Here. Jeremy made a little Gilbert blood donation for your locator spell.
 You're still mad at me for what happened to Abby. Let me apologize. I'm sorry Elijah forced us to turn your mother into a vampire to save Elena's life. Didn't exactly have a choice.
 Well, he already has a brother. Not to be, you know, territorial or anything.
 Well...I offered to snap his neck, put him out of his misery but...he didn't take me up on it.
 Well, you just think a guy so used to dying, wouldn't want to drag it out.
 Hmm...apparently my choices have been a little controversial lately.
 That's what he wants.
 Aw, Ric.
 I was drunk when I told you that.
 Damn you. Sorry I killed you. Twice.
 Drink.
 Ha, yeah! This stuff will kill ya.
 What are you doing here?
 Hey, Bonnie...What, are you sleepwalking or something? Bonnie?
 
 We have a problem.
 Don't blame me. Blame Bonnie the blood bank. She fed him.
 Oh, you mean the white oak one? The one that can kill an Original and wipe out an entire line of vampires? We don't know.
 Because I do stupid things, Bonnie. I do things, like let my friend die with dignity when I should have just killed him.
 So, what's the witchy work around?
 Now.
 Yeah, about that. Something happened.
 Can't help you there.
 Where is she?
 What do you mean she's not here? Where did she go?
 Klaus wants in, we have to keep him out.
 Ah, duck!
 Missed me!
 Missed me again!
 I'll take those odds.
 I'm good with that too.
 Huh, that's a great idea. What's to stop me from getting killed instantly?
 Caroline's in there. Don't you have a thing for her? Or did she just reject you too many times?
 Well, this is promising.
 I'm sorry, I forgot about her stellar track record in the dependability department.
 Don't get your hopes up! Might be a Girl Scout.
 We had signed over the deed to Elena, but she died. The seal broke, very long story. 
 Gotta say I'm team Bonnie on this one. How hard can it be to parch a vampire?
 What? What does that mean? Bonnie, I don't speak witch.
 Digital locator spell. Why the hell do we need you then?
 Hand it over.
 By my math, you've already bit it once, this will be twice, wearing that thing and if for some reason, Bonnie can't restart your heart and you do indeed die, then before you know it, we have another psycho alter ego case on our hands, which is bad so give me the ring.
 Fine. Be stubborn. 
 Or you're just lying to save your ass.
 Do it now!
 Why am I still alive?
 What?
 Hey, are you okay?
 Come on.
 Yeah, but the sun's about to go down and Ric's gonna be able to terrorize the streets any minute.
 We'll call you from the road, after we dump Klaus' body in the Atlantic.
 Yeah..
 How many desiccated hybrids does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
 Yeah I'm in a good mood. Klaus is dead, my brother's half way sane, again. Give or take an immortal hunter who wants to kill us, we won, Stefan. Come on say it. Say it.
 Once more with feeling.
 Thank you.
 It only took a century and a half.
 You know how these things pan out, Stefan. She'll probably make a list of pros and cons and then at the end of the day dump both of our asses.
 Then she'll pick one of us.
 And in sixty years, we'll go back to being brothers and none of this will have mattered. Right?
 Fine, if she chooses you, I'll leave town too. All this over one girl.
 Yeah, she is.
 You did what?
 Not when you have a parade of vampires at your disposal!
 Jeremy, get Elena home, we're on our way.
 Have I told you lately how much I appreciate you not being the dumbest brother on Earth?
 Our life is one, big, proverbial coin toss.
 Not! Hello? Did that concussion give you brain damage?! His lunatic siblings will kill you the first chance they get!
 No! No, no, no, no! Did I mention no?
 Oh, come on!
 You know, I'm not half way out of Virginia and Elena sells our souls to the Originals?
 You know what else is her call? Everything bad ever.
 Hidden. I was gonna use Unit 666, but figured that would be a little obvious. So...
 Oh, creepy.
 Just jam the witch locator, bat signal or whatever and get on with it, Bonnie.
 Bonnie just left. Rebekah should be here soon to pick up the body.
 You just had to let her make the choice, didn't you?
 Grabbed her, gagged her, threw her in a well, I don't know, anything other than let her trust Elijah.
 Yeah, but she'd be alive and she'd hate me. Thus, the eternal difference between you and me, brother.
 Will do. 
 It's about time, sexy Bex.
 How did you find me?
 In a storage locker. There's only about a thousand of them, have at it.
 Rebekah. Shhhh.
 No, don't!
 Rebekah, run. Run!
 Bad news, brother. Alaric staked Klaus. He's dead.
 No.
 Yeah or Klaus was lying about being the sire of our bloodline.
 For us to have our epic goodbye, Stefan?
 Well, I guess you'll just have to say goodbye for both of us, won't you? Call me if you cough up a lung.
 Let me guess. Calling to see if the Grim Reaper's paid a visit?
 Not yet. But I'm sure we'll have a laugh when we find out that Klaus is a big, fat liar.
 Hey, where are you?
 To Stefan.
 Ah, I know, I get it. So, since I'm possibly a dead man, can I ask you a question?
 If it was just down to him and me and you had to make a choice who got the goodbye, who would it be?
 Yeah, I get it. Stefan, it's always gonna be Stefan.
 Yeah, maybe.
 Real soon. Goodbye, Elena.
 I see you're still pissed. I take it Goldilocks gave you the slip.
 You're kind of invincible, Ric.
 We were.
 Katherine.
 Oh, you – you just look...I'm sorry, you just really remind me of someone. I'm Damon.
 You're one to talk. You're out here all by yourself.
 About what? May I ask.
 And you don't want it?
 Well, that's not true. You want what everybody wants.
 Hm, well, let's just say I've been around a long time. I've learned a few things.
 You want a love that consumes you. You want passion, an adventure, and even a little danger.
 I want you to get everything that you're looking for, but right now I want you to forget that this happened. Can't have people knowing that I'm in town yet. Goodnight, Elena.
 Is that all you got?
 Oh no.
 No. No, no, no, no. Ric, Ric! You are not dead. You are not dead.
 Where is she?
 Where is she!?
 What are you saying?
 You what?
 Alive? 
 Save you? He didn't.
 And when Rebekah ran Matt's truck off the road, you had vampire blood in your system, Elena.
 No, the only thing that's going to help is for you to feed and complete the transition.
 There is no way out of it. We all know the drill. You feed or you die. There is no door number three.
 Your choice, Elena. As always.
 Way to get her hopes up for something that's never happened in the history of vampirism.
 Then you shouldn't have let her die.
 And now the world has one more quarterback. Bravo, brother.
 Cute PJs!
 I brought you this.
 I just have to say something.
 Because what I'm about to say is probably the most selfish thing I've ever said in my life.
 No, I just have to say it once. You just need to hear it. I love you, Elena. And it's because I love you that I can't be selfish with you. Why you can't know this? I don't deserve you, but my brother does.
 God, I wish you didn't have to forget this. But you do.
 Good advice. Have you seen one?
 They're gone. Whoever nailed Rebekah, took them too. Please tell me you have something. Anything.
 So, the Mayor and the Sheriff never contemplated a backup plan, Liz?
 Perfect. We've narrowed it down to nowhere.
 In what world are you the one that gets to live?!
 Come on, guys, think. It takes a lot to hold a vampire. Reinforced steel, iron doors.
 
 Nah, we don't need weapons. Just bait.
 Yoo-hoo! Anybody home? Big, bad vampire out here.
 Well, that's the point. Give me Stefan and Elena, he's all yours.
 Come on, Pastor. You know I'll kill him. I want to kill him.
 Oh, yes I can.
 It should have been you.
 Yep. Guy just won't die.
 It's a little hard to keep track of all your choices lately, Elena.
 Would it have made a difference?
 I didn't think so.
 Are we done here?
 I would have saved you! In a heartbeat, no question.
 But you wouldn't be! And you would have gotten to grow up and had the life that you wanted; the life that you deserved. And I know that I didn't use to get that but I do now and I wanted that for you, Elena, and I would have gladly have given it to you and let Matt die; because I am that selfish. But you knew that already. The first night we met is not all that you remember.
 You're making a big mistake.
 You're reaching.
 Delusional!
 Wrong. You're just wrong, Stefan.
 Then you better hope she's not a fan of Bambi.
 She needs human blood, Stefan, from the vein.
 You name me one who went on a bunny diet and didn't kill dozens.
 It happens to the best of us at least once. We get over it, Stefan. A hundred years or so.
 She can't learn to control the bloodlust, if she's never actually experienced the bloodlust.
 It's a cheat. It's like giving a kid a calculator before they know math.
 Nope. I say rip off the proverbial band-aid and let it bleed. You're a vampire, Elena. Be a vampire.
 Vampires eat people!
 It's part of the natural food pyramid. Trust me, you're going to be miserable.
 That seat's taken.
 'Faulty gas line leads to tragic explosion at Young farm.' 
 Well, don't look at me. I always take credit for killing people.
 Seriously, stop looking at me like that, Liz. If I was going to kill twelve people, I wouldn't blow them up, I'd have a dinner party.
 You say that like it's a bad thing.
 The Council's dead, Liz. I see that as a win.
 Well, your friends tried to kill your daughter.
 Who's the new guy?
 
 That seat's taken.
 Well, I'm just going to pretend like there's someone there, because the alternative is just too damn depressing.
 Am I wearing my "I Blew Up The Council" t-shirt, why does everybody keep asking me that?
 No. Anything else?
 Well, there's a shock.
 
 Fine, come on.
 Giving you what you need. Drink.
 You're a new vampire, Elena. You need warm blood from the vein. Maybe this will do the trick. Or not. But just, don't tell Stefan.
 Because blood sharing is kind of personal.
 Just drink.
 I'm here. I'm here. Where are you?
 Not yet.
 You again. Stalking small town funerals?
 Damon. Germaphobe. 
 So, what brings you to Mystic Falls? Bible salesman?
 Oh.
 Huh, well, I was unaware.
 I breathe pretty easy.
 Well, enjoy your stay. We love visitors and the scenery is to die for. 
 Would you mind saying that a little louder?
 Here.
 I don't know, maybe it's your doppelgänger blood. You're rejecting the transition.
 No, you're not dying. You just need to drink from the vein.
 Don't you think like that. Elena, you'll be fine. Okay?
 
 Mid-service snack. Church always gets me hungry. The whole blood of Christ thing, you know.
 I brought it for Elena.
 It's not my way, it's the only way.
 What and become a Ripper?
 Well, God forbid, she's anything like me. That's really what you're thinking. She's gonna go off the rails eventually, anyways, Stefan, so the faster we can make it happen, the sooner we can get her back on track.
 She's starving, Stefan! She hasn't been able to keep blood down for days.
 Well, then she lied. Your four-legged protein shake was a bust. The juice box is a no go. She can't even keep my blood down.
 Oops! I said that out loud?
 
 She doesn't look so good.
 Jealousy's beneath you, brother.
 
 I'm gonna go rip his head off now.
 Well, I think the risk will be slightly diminished when I, you know, rip his head off.
 You have ten seconds before I go old fashioned on the new guy.
 Three, two, one. Bye.
 Ow.
 Uhh, what the hell was that for?
 What are we doing here?
 Stefan, what are we doing?
 So, you're lighting lanterns?
 What we need to do is find out who this hunter is and what he knows about the death of the Council. We have more important things to be doing right now than this.
 No way. I'm not doing that.
 They're floating lanterns in the sky, can you believe that? A Japanese lantern is the symbol of letting go of the past. Well, here's a news flash  we're not Japanese!
 Do you know what they are? Children. Like lighting a candle is going to make everything okay or even saying a prayer or pretending Elena is not going to end up just like the rest of us murderous vampires. Stupid, delusional, exasperating, little children. I know what you're going to say  "It makes them feel better, Damon." So what?
 For how long? A minute, a day? What differences does it make? 
 And a rock with a birthday carved into it that I'm pretty sure is wrong.
 So, thanks, friend. Thanks for leaving me here to babysit, because I should have been long gone by now. I didn't get the girl, remember? I'm just stuck here fighting with my brother and taking care of the kids. You owe me big.
 Good day for a midlife crisis. 164 years, I'd say you're due.
 
 That hunter jacked Tyler Lockwood of his werewolf venom last night, so basically, he's got vampire poison in a bottle. And I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna eat him.
 I don't want your help. I just want to kill this guy and get the hell out of town. Wasn't that the deal? Whoever Elena doesn't choose leaves?
 And I stayed to help. If I take you punching me as the first clue, I'm not wanted here anymore.
 No, brother, dramatic would be leaving before I kill this hunter.
 Um...Yeah.
 Come in. Close the door.
 Okay. It's a kitten. It's an adorable, exploding kitten.
 Because I'm proud, and stubborn, and...oh, look! You're already here.
 Come on, you're not gonna get hurt. All I need you to do is be doctorly and cut out the arrow. I'd do it myself, but if I move...
 So, how well did you know Pastor Young?
 Nice, crazy guy. He wrote a letter about sacrifice and war brewing in Mystic Falls.
 
 
 
 Hope you plan on cleaning this up.
 Top drawer in the dresser.
 No.
 But, you weren't looking for alcohol, were you? 
 Hunter mishap.
 Yep. Jeremy told me.
 Don't worry about it.
 Cherish the thought that he might actually be useful, Elena.
 You staying for the show or...?
 
 I'm going after the vampire hunter, so if he'd like to join...?
 Did I say that I was a germaphobe? Pft, sorry, I meant vampire.
 Stings, doesn't it?
 Keep it up, buddy. We'll be scraping you off the ceiling.
 Let's start with the basics. Where are you from? What do you know? Maybe you can cue me in on this "greater evil," because I've fought this guy  
 See, this is what I like to hear; vague threats, ominous prophecies, disappearing tattoos.
 Don't bother, you can't see the damn thing.
 The what?
 Because you're a vampire now. And part of you knows you're a lot more like me than you are like him.
 Yep, still is. In tiny little pieces.
 
 Shhh, badasses don't say that. 
 Nice job.
 And we did! Congrats.
 It was contained. Nobody got hurt. Come on, buy me a farewell drink. 
 Stop! Stop.
 
 Nothing you should be ashamed of. You are a vampire now. You just have to learn the right way to be one. And I'm gonna teach you.
 Some personal items that I snaked from the vampire hunter's RV. May he rest in peace. I'm searching for a supernatural handbook.
 Definitely wasn't natural. The guy magically appeared just as someone blows up the entire Founders Council. He's covered in a tattoo that only Jeremy Gilbert - of all people in the world - seems to be able to see. Klaus mentioned something about him being one of The Five. Then he kamikazes himself with explosives. Sound natural to you?
 That's what I'm hoping is in the first chapter of the handbook. 
 Can't tell you. Private. We're in a fight.
 Not still mad at me about Elena?
 Very well, then. They didn't find any remains at the explosion site.
 Apparently so. I'm gonna need you to get on this today. I have to take Elena to college.
 I'm teaching her how to feed. She needs to learn snatch, eat, erase now more than ever. 
 Oh, stop with the pity party. If I can go to college, you can go to college.
 Sure, plenty of times. I always had a thing for sorority girls. 
 I know.
 What is this guy, Witch-apedia?
 You're not a Ripper.
 Well then, pick someone and we'll find out.
 Stoner guys are no good to grab. They're too paranoid and you don't want the extra buzz.
 Now, she is a fun size, a tutor. Geeky girls are inherently suspicious of anyone who is nice to them. What you want, 
 I was just saying how much I love witches.
 She's young and healthy; she'll heal up like a charm. Just keep your eye on the ball. Okay?
 Fine, it's not a game. It's a high stakes dangerous maneuver. Now, just go, just like we practiced. That's all you have to do.
 What the hell are you doing?
 Everybody is someone's uncle or father or camp counselor or bible study teacher. Elena, you don't know these people, why do you care?
 Nothing. Elena is educating me on the importance of feelings.
 Oh, nice, the answer to all of our problems. A frat party  douche central. 
 So, what should we go as? Victims or killers?
 I'm Jack. 
 Well hats off to these idiots 
 You do that.
 
 Roofie guy?
 Nice choice. Go get him.
 Now remember the idea is not to kill him. 
 Nice touch. How do you feel?
 Guessing we should hit the road.
 She's not out of control. She was having fun.
 She is a different person. She's a vampire. We're a predatory species. We enjoy the hunt, the feed, and the kill. When the guilt gets too bad we switch off our humanity and we revel in it.
 She already is like me. And you know what makes me able to drink my fill and leave someone breathing and not rip their head off like my brother? It's that I can revel in it. I can make it fun.
 Well then, goodnight.
 What do you feel, Elena?
 You don't want to be like me.
 Any news on the hunter?
 Well then, today was a bust.
 She's all yours.
 Where's Stefan?
 He's not answering his phone and he's not here, which you know, big deal, we've only got a killer vampire hunter on the loose.
 Hmm. 
 Oh, I don't know, maybe the hot, sweaty dance party business. 
 Ohhh, you didn't tell him, did you?
 No, I see, it's just a classic shame spiral.
 Oh, you so are. Newbie vampire remorse? Oof, it's worse than a hangover.
 So, either he's dodging both of us.
 So, we each take a different entrance; hit them at the same time.
 Where the hell have you been?
 Yeah, we have a plan. The plan is I'm gonna rip Connor's heart out and I'm going to feed it to him.
 Hence, the open heart surgery.
 Good, great. No cops, no witnesses, no reason to wait around.
 Until you figure it out? Is that where you've been all morning? Out buying bossy pants?
 Fine. Fine, if you want to take some time to do recon, you get one hour. But we're gonna need some extra help. So, where the hell's the Wicked Witch of the West?
 Really? Well, call her, tell her Jeremy's life is in danger; maybe that will bring her out of retirement.
 Bonnie, hopefully. Maybe she decided to make herself useful again.
 It's our way in. Courtesy of Alaric Saltzman's interest in the Mystic Falls Underground Railroad.
 Yep.
 How many hostages?
 Those two idiots, they're like danger magnets.
 Well, the clock's ticking, brother.
 No, you're not. This guy doesn't know that you're a vampire, let's keep it that way.
 No. Best case scenario is now you're a hostage. Worst case scenario  he figures you out, kills you on the spot.
 So what? Now you're gonna take on a professional killer?
 Bang. You're dead. Now what?
 For someone who doesn't want to be like me, you sure are good at it.
 We'll get him out. I promise.
 Stefan is on his way. This will be over soon.
 Well, we'll get him out of this and we'll compel him down to the Bahamas. Maybe he'll find an island girl.
 Got it. It was in his weapons drawer with seven stakes, some weird MacGyver crossbow, and the last remaining vervain in Mystic Falls, so how about we get this party started.
 Since when did we team up with Klaus and the Lollipop Guild?
 Well, how are you sure that he even has werewolf venom? Why is Klaus involved, Stefan?
 Start telling the truth, Stefan. Why is Klaus involved? Did he compel you?
 You know what, she's right. Screw your plan. I'll kill Connor myself.
 Ohh, where's Stefan? I'm gonna kill him.
 Ow! Ow!
 Because he's playing us. All this stalling, getting hybrids, taking my ring, add it up.
 He's either made a deal with Klaus or he's compelled.
 No, Elena, this guy is dangerous!
 Then you need to be smart. He doesn't know you're a vampire. You get as close as you can and you kill him.
 Good work, brother.
 Not after what I just went through. I had to punch through a boiler room basement into a septic tank to get into this stupid tunnel. But it'll be worth it.
 That's the thing, you're not. I don't know what you're up to or what Klaus has over you, but even if I have to go through you, I'm gonna kill him.
 Why? Because Klaus wants him alive?
 I don't want to. I don't have to. Not gonna. Now, give him to me, brother.
 Why are you protecting him?! Tell me.
 Tell me.
 Then it has to be good. Spill it!
 Spill it!
 A cure for what?
 Klaus told you there's a cure for vampirism?
 Elena, it's complicated.
 How is she?
 I had to go through six locks to get it.
 I needed something to back up your insanity. You figure out how to tell Klaus you lost a hunter and a hybrid?
 Well, I got your back, you know, when he comes to murder you.
 About what? About the cure we don't have, can't find, and probably doesn't exist? You're welcome.
 Alleged chance.
 Well, I'll remain a skeptic for now. So what's your next move?
 Sure, Stefan, since you asked; I'd be happy to go on a suicide mission with you for a potentially non-existent cure. No problem.
 Because you were being a pain in the ass.
 Tell me one thing. Why do you want to cure her?
 A legitimate one. You want to cure her because she's a vampire and she's not cut out to be? Or you can't love her if she is one?
 Well, if I'm gonna ride this fairy tale to its conclusion, I want to be clear about one thing.
 I'm fine with her either way, brother. So, if I do this, I'm doing it for you.
 Thanks for not ditching the family ring after it drove Ric crazy? 
 In all fairness, I mean, I think you killing him kinda trumps that. And you should have called Stefan.
 PS, I called Stefan.
 Long story, buy the e-book.
 Where did Jeremy go?
 Or maybe he didn't want to linger in a house where his sister just jammed a knife in his neck.
 Oooh, time to face the music. Pay the piper, dance with the devil.
 Quit avoiding him, that means shady. Shady people get outed.
 What's wrong?
 Elena!
 Elena!
 Well, "lost" is a very strong word, we just technically don't know where she is.
 How does Klaus know anything? Guy's like a billion years old.
 But nothing, wave your magic wand, hocus pocus, begone hunter ghostus, whatever.
 Where are you going?
 You got this?
 You're missing all the adventure, pal.
 I audited your class. Very enlightening.
 The origin of a species.
 Not that species.
 I was kind of hoping you might have stumbled upon this at some point, maybe.
 Came to me in a dream. Do you know anything about the hunter's curse?
 Metaphorically speaking.
 That'd be great. 
 Yeah, about that.
 Little Gilbert, your services are needed.
 The witch who loses her powers gets left out of the important conversations.
 Easy, Van Helsing. We'll get you one. Don't worry.
 You can rest easy, brother. We figured out how to solve our little Elena problem.
 What? Again?
 Elena.
 Didn't take a genius to figure it out. Third time's the charm.
 Look at you, being all glass is half empty. Let's just go talk about this before you do something stupid, okay?
 Where's your ring?
 Where's your ring, Elena?
 We need to get you inside.
 What you're going through is a curse. We know how to break it, but we just have to get you inside.
 Damn it, Elena.
 It's okay.
 Fished it out of the river for you.
 Little tip, vampires hate to swim. How are you feeling?
 Well, you know what they say about teenage suicide.
 Don't do it.
 You weren't yourself.
 
 Because I know that you think Stefan's been lying to you. Which, yeah, he has, but this rough patch that you two have been going through is not what you think. Everything that he's been doing, he's been doing for you. To help you. And after he kills me for telling you this, I want you to throw my ashes off of Wickery Bridge, okay?
 There may be a way out of this for you, Elena.
 There may be a cure.
 
 Make that two.
 I'd say I'm in the market for a new drinking buddy. You're not qualified.
 You're on the verge of impressing me. Drive it home.
 Where have you been?
 Where you going?
 Okay, I see shady Stefan is back.
 Please don't tell me that you're still working with Klaus.
 Oh. Got it. Uh, well, I'll be quick then. So, apparently, if we want to find the cure, we have to find a vampire hunter who can kill enough vampires to reveal the map on the hunter's mark. Now, unless we want Jeremy to go all Connor two-point-oh, I suggest we find a different hunter.
 And I was gonna ask Professor Shane, but turns out he's shadier than you are. Matt Donovan connected him and the Pastor through phone records. Apparently, the two were very chatty the day that the Pastor blew up the Council.
 Yeah, unless he tells me what he's up to. 
 Or we could just blow it off and go get drunk. Brother bond over some Tri Delts. If you, you know, want some quality time.
 She got my vote.
 
 Where's Professor Shane?
 
 It's a pageant. That's the whole point.
 Neither did Elena and she wore blue.
 See? April cares. Red, right, Elena?
 And my work here is done.
 Still here.
 Stefan told me about the break up.
 I'd say I'm sorry but I'm not.
 Oh, you know Stefan, he kind of just went on and on about it and wouldn't shut up.
 Nope. But I'm sure it has something to do with you acting weird, so why don't you tell me?
 Professor Shane. Just the guy I wanted to see.
 So, I'm in search of another Hunter.
 Mhm.
 Same reason anyone needs a Hunter. Loneliness, drinking buddy, or for golf.
 I did, but he ended up being a potential problem.
 Hmm, why don't you help me with this...
 Why are you here? What's in your little lesson plan there, Professor?
 Hey, no pity votes for April Young, okay? I mean, just because her dad blew up a house with a dozen people in it doesn't mean she should get a tiara. But you knew him, didn't you? Because I hear you two racked up a pretty impressive phone bill.
 Okay. How did you convince the Pastor to kill all those people?
 Do the math. Emo teen, open bar, it's fine.
 Relax, I'm sure he's fine.
 If I'm not worried, you shouldn't be worried. Let it go. I'll go look for him.
 Please don't tell me that you've roped Jeremy into a world of crazy.
 Oh right, so you can turn her back into the girl that is still in love with you.
 Of course you would think that. Leave it alone, Stefan.
 Oh, hey.
 How do those two know each other?
 The Council just got burnt to a crisp. Some mysterious Hunter just blew through town and this guy just happens to know everything about everything. Yes, paranoid.
 Well, you still never gave me a name. And it's kind of urgent.
 Like you didn't already know.
 You have five seconds to give me another name or you die.
 What kind of witch?
 I love pressure points. What kind of witch?
 A Bennett witch.
 I was being polite. I thought you hated whiskey.
 Welcome to the club.
 You want to know what I think.
 I don't think I've ever seen you more alive.
 When we danced together.
 Elena?
 Hey.
 Thought you might've left.
 What face? 
 I'm happy.
 Bag?
 Scarf.
 No. No, no no. Don't ruin it.
 Well, I'm assuming it starts with, "What are we?" And then ends with, "Going to tell Stefan?"
 I know he should know. I just don't know when he should know it.
 Yeah, but can't we just let ourselves enjoy one secret, selfish day before we destroy his?
 No, Elena. This is our time. It's never been right before but it is right now. Just one day? One day?
 Yes.
 Hey.
 Sired? Really Stefan? That is the most pathetic nonsense I've ever heard come out of your mouth, and you've said some crap in your day.
 Sure I can. I finally got Elena to a good place about being a vampire. You two idiots can't stand that she's happy because of me.
 She can't. Her weird doppelgänger body rejected the blood from the bag.
 When her body rejects this blood, which it will, your apology better be epic.
 Forgot your lunch.
 Well, last time you tried it, the circumstances were less optimal and I think maybe you should just give it another try, see if it works. I really think it will. 
 Are you okay?
 You sure you're okay?
 Elena is sired. You were right, I was wrong. Happy?
 Well, I'm working on it. Here.
 Remember that?
 1942, to be exact.
 Other than bourbon and beads...
 That was no ordinary girl. That was Charlotte.
 
 Hi.
 So, did you decide who you would like to have for dinner tonight?
 That's a very fine choice, Miss Charlotte. I will go set that up. Now, if anyone tries to touch my drink, you show them no mercy, OK? 
 
 That was my first clue.
 More like when she went all "Fatal Attraction" on me, then I had to make a clean break.
 
 The witch that I found to help me break little Charlotte's sire bond. 
 Have you been back here since '42?
 Somebody had to entertain the ladies who had been left by their menfolk. 
 
 You know what I haven't gotten? Blame, guilt. I get it Stefan. I get that your pissed that Elena dumped you because she has feelings for me. Bet you blame the sire bond for that, too.
 Why, because it's impossible to think she could have feelings for me?
 What'd you say?
 You look like a guy I used to know.
 Come to put a stake in my heart?
 Egypt, ha! Finally gonna get to see the pyramids.
 Think they have room for another driver? 
 I don't like you.
 What makes you think I'm not balanced and restrained?
 Well, I beg to differ.
 Sorry, I lost track of time.
 Charlotte!
 Stefan!
 Stefan.
 Stefan?
 Stefan.
 Well, dont get all warm and fuzzy on me yet. 
 No, but since I couldn't remember where the store was, figured it'd give us a start.
 Yeah, maybe.
 Corner of Bourbon and Dumaine. Kind of told her to count every brick in every building in New Orleans, and I'd meet her at the corner. 
 Where you going?
 There's no way she's gonna be in the same spot after seventy years.
 I was hoping we wouldn't have to tell her anything.
 It's not a lie. It's an omission for the greater good.
 Oh, what about you, O selfless one? Are you doing what's best for Elena or what's best for you? Because it looks to me like the only reason you want to break Elena's sire bond is to restore her original factory "Team Stefan" settings.
 I'm gonna go get a drink. Hunt me down when you stop being a dick.
 She kissed me.
 Uh, Charlotte, uh. Ha.
 Please tell me you had a full life and that you've done something other than counting bricks.
 Yeah, heh..
 Well you know, in the plus column, you know New Orleans better than anyone in the world. Which is really nice, because we need your help finding someone.
 Hi. We're looking for a witch. Sorry, no time for pleasantries.
 Look..
 She had a grimoire and it had a spell.
 How much?
 Well, I was hoping the recipe had changed.
 Okay, fine, listen, just tell us where we can find someone like your great-grandma who can break the sire bond and won't flake out on us like old Val did.
 Witch is lying. Doesn't practice magic, my ass.
 Extreme circumstances call for extreme measures.
 Absolutely, I did, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat if it meant a clean slate with Elena.
 Are you gonna help me good cop/bad cop this witch or not?
 Calling you out. You're not Val's great-granddaughter. You're her daughter.
 You're 80 years old. You don't look a day over 50. You're a practicing witch.
 Give me what I want.
 Are you saying there's no spell?
 No, I need to get on with my life and so do you.
 If you want to make me happy you will. You just forget about me. You'll never think of me again, and you'll find someone new, and you'll be happier than ever.
 Please, stop crying.
 Yes, you are. And I'm never gonna be happy until you realize that you're never gonna have the life that you deserve if I'm in it. 
 I set her free.
 Get to the point, Stefan. You don't think I'm gonna be able to do what I need to when I have to tell Elena to stay away from me.
 Yeah? Well, one of these days you're gonna realize you don't know me half as well as you think.
 Well, Uncle Sam begs to differ.
 How do you know they didn't have it coming?
 I've pretty much been on my own since our little falling out in 1912. Did you ever think that I just need my little brother?
 Good luck, Brother.
 Yeah, well, next time I'll hang a billboard.
 The dreaded C - word.
 I know what I have to do Stefan.
 Hey back.
 Awful. Yours?
 Elena, um...we need to talk.
 Not exactly. Which is why we need to talk.
 Everything has changed, Elena.
 You know what would make me happy? To know that this entire time that I've been completely in love with you; that what you actually felt for me; was real.
 I don't want to do this, Elena. I'm not the good guy, remember? I'm the selfish one. I take what I want. I do what I want. I lie to my brother, I fall in love with his girl, I don't do the right thing.
 But I have to do the right thing by you.
 This would be so much more fun if we were naked.
 I was being a gentleman. 
 I should have made you leave. Sent you packing. I promised Stefan.
 You're sired to me, Elena. Which means everything that you think you feel; might not even be real.
 Well, I can make you. Invoke the sire bond.
 I told him I would set you free. Right after I didn't tell him that we slept together.
 I wanna throw you back in my bed and never let you leave.
 Saved by the cell phone.
 What the hell is Professor Shadypants doing here?
 Well, he's not walking around with it. Check the rest of the house.
 Try the sock drawer. People leave the sketchiest stuff in sock drawers.
 Here's two  Kill Tyler before he goes to Klaus or, since Klaus has suddenly become MVP in our relay race for the cure, tell him about the hybrids and he'll kill Tyler.
 Hello? Stefan?
 I think she's running around...trying to figure out how to deprogram Jeremy.
 Not well.
 Peachy.
 Gotta go. Bonnie has enlisted Dr. Evil in her plan and I have to thwart him.
 You're not allowed to feel this sorry for yourself unless you're sitting on a bar stool.
 Fortunately, I travel with the bar.
 Maybe there's something else they can try.
 Survey says  Ehhh. Professor Shane has been dipping into the magical herbs a little too much; if he thinks using a vampire to suppress the need to kill another one is gonna work on a Hunter. It's like dangling a cheeseburger in front of someone on a master cleanse. Just find someone else to attach your warm and fuzzy detour feelings to.
 Gee, I wonder who that could be.
 Well, this isn't awkward at all. I'll be anywhere else.
 If your hypno herbs work, we should be singing "Kumbaya" around the fire by dinner.
 So now, tell me why I'm not killing you?
 I'm serious. Why are you after the vampire cure?
 Klaus' sword will tell us where to find it.
 It's a rock.
 Hm, so is this that silly little wives tale that you told at the occult exhibit?
 Don't ask how or why or who, but I just found the answer to your Tyler problem.
 And where'd you say he was buried? Oh, I forgot, you didn't.
 
 So write a thesis.
 I'm not buying it.
 Look at you, suddenly poly optimist.
 Maybe because I think he blew up twelve people at the Young farm.
 Little tip, Professor, I heard you before you even took your first step.
 Elena, we can't. I can't.
 It's good to see you like that. All normal with your brother. I want that again for you.
 Christmas was always mine and Stefan's favorite holiday when we were kids. Not that I've celebrated it since. I kind of miss that.
 I've been lying to him all day.
 The point is not what I was doing. The point is that I'm here with you. I was supposed to invoke the sire bond, Elena, send you away. I was supposed to do the right thing by you and the right thing by my brother. Which is what I'm gonna do right now.
 You're gonna go home.
 I'm gonna stay here with Jeremy. I'm gonna help him complete the mark. I'll teach him how to hunt, I'll protect him, and we'll kill vampires without you.
 I'm setting you free, Elena. This is what I want. This is what will make me happy.
 So do it.
 You couldn't miss it. It was in slow motion.
 Okay.
 Take a seat at the bench, quarterback. Kid wants a shot at the title.
 Now, all I have to do is apply a little pressure on your jaw.
 Really? Again?
 Why? Are you offering?
 That's something extra to cut off the pizza pipeline for a couple a days. No matter how much they beg, don't come back.
 If that's what it takes to make you into a hunter. Now, run around the lake...twice.
 Keep him company.
 You do if you want to eat.
 Good. Now, do it like your life depends on it, 'cause it does.
 Both require you to be alive. Which is why I updated our relationship status to 'it's complicated.' Have you talked to her at all? Elena?
 If we throw Jeremy out into the real world right now, he's chum.
 Zero.
 You know, now that you mention it...Jeremy, watch and learn.
 That's for Carol Lockwood.
 If you're here for payback, go for it, 'cause you'll be stuck baby-sitting the little hunter that could.
 I know how to whittle, thanks. Now I know why those hybrids hated you. You are annoying.
 Darwinism, Klaus. He needs to be able to protect himself before we hunt down his first vampire nest.
 You don't think that occurred to me, Klaus?
 What did you do?
 Hope your day's going better than mine. Gotta say, I'm liking the odds.
 Ooh...How'd he take it?
 Well, I'm thinking, for the first time all week, I'm happy to be at camp nowhere.
 That depends on how much you trust me.
 Then I think he's going to get through this just fine.
 Yeah, well, I told them, if they were good, I'd buy them both ice cream, so...Look, I gotta go.
 Look. I'm going to get this cure for you...and I'm going to have to do things you're not gonna like.
 Listen carefully. Get in your car, right now. Come to me.
 Well, I thought about it, and then I realized his idea was better.
 You have to kill vampires to complete the hunter's mark. Mark equals cure. You're in a bar full of almost vampires, so get your hunt on.
 Jeremy, they're not people.
 No, no. You turn them, he kills them. That was the deal, Klaus.
 You know he can't take them all on at the same time.
 Ah...Jeremy, go get the weapons out of the car. I'll be right behind you. 
 Don't hesitate! You're lucky it was me. Otherwise you two'd be dead.
 I was trying to get this thing over with. You're the one that pissed off Klaus. Now you have to fight your way out of it.
 They're newbies. They're still trying to figure out how to track, which means you have two seconds to get ready to fight.
 Wait, you want to run?
 
 He's not the best student in the world.
 Stop talking. Look, I know you're angry, but my way was the easiest, fastest, and safest way to complete his mark to get you the cure.
 Hey, there would have been no danger if he hadn't gone all bleeding heart.
 The mark grew, didn't it?
 Yes, I know. 
 Trust me. I will keep him safe. Okay?
 
 All right. There you go.
 Listen, just go one at a time, only shoot for the heart, don't hesitate, and don't miss. 
 
 Something's not right.
 Looks like we're gonna have to find some new vampires. What a waste.
 He's underage, and I don't like you, so let's just cut to it.
 Why? What's it to you either way?
 Oh...You must be talking about Silas.
 Nothing. Don't want to. Not our problem.
 Uh-uh.
 We're not going to back off the cure 'cause you were told one too many scary bedtime stories, you idiot.
 Jeremy, run!
 
 I'm gonna rip out your spleen.
 Nope.
 Kol happened.
 Is he here? 'Cause I just want to talk to him really fast.
 Well, I should go apologize to him. I was-I was pretty tough on him today.
 Don't you ever take a night off?
 Where's Jeremy?
 Hmm. 
 It was Kol. He must have compelled me. If I find Jeremy...I'm gonna kill him. 
 
 You can't hide in here, Jer. If I find you, you're dead.
 
 
 Seriously? You're being hunted by a vampire, and now you're bleeding?
 
 
 Ow. Ugh. 
 
 Why, because Stefan did?
 I'm sorry, Elena. 
 Jeremy.
 Shoot now.
 
 You sound real torn up about it. Shouldn't we be going after Kol, make him decompel me?
 
 You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
 Stefan, wait. Stefan! 
 You coming to snap my neck again? Because I woke up feeling completely un-murderous, and I'm pretty sure that it's safe to set me free.
 Oh man, really? You practically bled me dry. At least spring for a bag or something. I'm thirsty.
 Not exactly what I had in mind.
 What the hell are you doing here?
 Oh.
 Silent treatment, huh? Is that your best shot? 
 Well, well. Looks like my brother ripped out a page of my revenge-sex handbook.
 No, you weren't. Are you kidding? You got there day two. Do you know how hard it is to get these Xbox brains to focus?
 Your brother problem, not mine, buddy.
 Well, we couldn't have him trying to stake Elena in her sleep, now, could we?
 Some people are just more capable of forgiveness than others. Bet you score about a negative 500 in that realm.
 I think this has something to do with a certain blonde vampire. I think you murdered Carol Lockwood, and I think you're worried that Caroline's never going to forgive you.
 Debatable. See, I don't mind being the bad guy, because somebody has to fill that role and get things done. You do bad things for no reason. You do them to be a dick.
 If you're gonna be bad, be bad with a purpose. Otherwise, you're just not worth forgiving.
 It's one of his trademarks, like his brooding and his hair.
 From a vampire who's been stabbed as many times as your sister, I'd say difficult.
 Sweet.
 Well, I am compelled to kill Jeremy, so I figured it's probably smarter to sit here and chit-chat with you than bust out of here like the Hulk.
 She's met me. She knows impulse control's not my strong suit.
 What do you know about love?
 I don't know.
 I don't know. I've been stuck in the penalty box with you since yesterday. Stefan won't talk to me, and Elena won't come to see me, so maybe you're right. Maybe she's written me off.
 I don't know anything about a plan.
 I will stay here until you return...
 ...or not.
 Where's that Gilbert optimism?
 Hi.
 Sorry I missed all the excitement.
 Let me guess, she pledged her allegiance to you while you were naked in the sack?
 Oh, was that supposed to be a secret? Maybe you should have made that a little clear while you were bleeding me dry in our cellar.
 Here we go.
 Couldn't they have hidden this cure in Hawaii? Where the hell did you take us?
 Oh yeah? I thought the whole point was that no one found Silas, the oldest, deadliest freak in the world.
 Is that a joke?
 Looks like someone forgot her team-building exercises.
 You know Stefan just brought her here to make it seem like he's moving on. He wants you to think that he's over you, and he wants me to think that I can't get under his skin.
 Human Rebekah...I can't imagine her without fangs.
 I don't like to speculate.
 Well, that's a good sign.
 What about me?
 Yeah, got it. Don't eat the poisonous flowers. 
 Well, that's lovely. There's a mystery man with a hatchet lurking in the woods and we're just gonna camp?
 Let's just keep going. You know? Get the cure. Get in, get out. Where is it?
 Stupid enough to raise an immortal witch, so I'd say...incredibly.
 Yeah, well we'll find out tomorrow.
 No. I'm saying we don't know. And if we find it tomorrow, we will.
 No, I get it. Everything changes tomorrow. It'll be all unicorns and rainbows.
 
 How much worse?
 Downside is, you turned her into a bomb that only you can dismantle.
 Let's split up.
 I'll stay here and make sure you're not lying.
 Thought it didn't work.
 So you can call someone? Like whoever took Jeremy?
 I'm done trusting you. 
 So, you've seen it?
 What does your dead wife have to do with a cure?
 Bonnie Bennett's related to this crazy-ass witch?
 So you have the rock, hunter, Bennett witch. What about the dozens that died in sacrifice? Where do they fit into all this?
 Which is how you manipulated the pastor to blow up a farmhouse full of people.
 We need three massacres. Fire at the Young farm. Holiday hybrid slaughter. What mass blood-letting am I forgetting?
 You're not finished. Is that why you brought us all out here in the middle of nowhere? To complete massacre number 3?
 I think you need to tell me where this magical well is.
 
 Where's the cure?
 I could kill you. Then no one would find it.
 Right. Because if I'm not here, then I can't get in between you and whatever you're planning with Silas. Well, I'm not that easily manipulated, professor. And there is one flaw in your logic. 
 I don't wonder, Elena, because I don't care. I don't care about her. I don't care about some lame-ass cure for vampires, either.
 Because I don't want you to be cured.
 Fine. Say they're real. Say you've become human and you still love me. Then what? You grow old. You die. I stay a vampire. Face reality, Elena. We don't work.
 
 You gotta be kidding me.
 You're one of the Five!
 Would you believe me if I said mosquitoes?
 Itchy.
 You obviously know who I am and where I'm from. Have you been spying on me?
 You wanna know something, just ask.
 Come on, man. Do I look like I know anything about tattoos? Look at my skin. It's flawless.
 Mind telling me where we're going?
 What a minute, you're using me to get to Bonnie Bennett? Whoa, brother, ha! You picked the wrong vampire.
 Here's the deal, Shrek. My witch friend will open the passage for you. No leverage necessary. We don't care about Silas. All we want is the cure, so you cut us in on your share, and we'll get out of your hair.
 
 Yeah, what does that have to do with me and my friends?
 So you use it on Silas, and we'll use it for whoever wants to use it.
 You don't want to share it with us?
 And why can't you share it?
 You touch me again 
 I don't care about the cure. In fact, I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to be a vampire. You know what? If I wasn't a vampire, then I wouldn't be able to do 9 of the things I'm gonna do to you when I'm free. 
 All right, I admit, okay? My friends want the cure, and I want them to have it, and I get very upset when I can't provide for my loved ones. But tell me something, Vaughn, if all you're worried about is Bonnie the teenage witch, then why'd you save Jeremy and Elena yesterday?
 Big guy. White paint all over him. You stuck a hatchet in his spine.
 We're on a remote island. There's you, me, and a bunch of unpleasant locals. You expect me to believe that someone else took out that monster truck of a human being that went after Jeremy and Elena?
 Was that you?
 No.
 Well, here we are. Looks like someone beat us to the punch.
 Ditto. You know, that pesky hunter's curse and all. 
 Wish I could make the same promise.
 I'm gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna get to that damn cure, and I'm gonna give it to the girl that I love.
 
 Are we gonna dance or are we gonna play?
 You're wasting time. Just get the cure. Go.
 
 There's only one dose of the cure, Stefan. She wants to take it, you want her to. I don't. Just do what makes her happy, Stefan.
 
 Yeah.
 Needed a siesta.
 
 Life sucks. Get a helmet.
 How'd this happen?
 What about the cure, or Silas?
 Where the hell is Bonnie?
 Okay, fine. I'll wait with her.
 He's supernatural. The ring won't work anymore. 
 Unless you're a blonde, a Bennett witch, or a doppelgänger, I suggest you steer clear.
 Yeah, someone - Katherine.
 Yeah. Sneaky little bitch must've been spying on us for weeks. She killed Jeremy...or somebody did. 
 Good. Well, you can send flowers after you help me find Bonnie. 
 If there's one thing that's a guarantee in this miserable little world, it's that Katherine Pierce is gone. We need to find Bonnie. Oh, and beware of the immortal Silas. If he was asleep in that cave, he's awake now.
 Never thought I'd say this, but I hope not.
 What, afraid of the big, bad Silas?
 
 Hey, somebody needed to find Bonnie.
 Sorry. Better you than me.
 Mm, just the guy I wanted to see. Not really.
 Here's the thing. I was completely willing to accept the fact that you were one man on a lonely mission to kill ol' Silas, and then I got boned by my vixen nemesis Miss Katherine Pierce, and then I start thinking there's no way that this is a coincidence. So what do you know, huh? 
 Well, if you want a lead on Katherine Pierce, here's your guy. 
 It'll be worth it.
 You are creepy.
 Hayley, Tyler Lockwood's old friend. Ah, I knew she was shady. Where'd Katherine find her?
 
 I wanted that cure for her because it's what she wanted. You might think I'm afraid to go back, but I'm not because I know what she needs. She needs me to bring her best friend home.
 
 
 
 Could you get Stefan out here?
 
 She's out of her mind, Stefan. The nutty professor's got her totally brainwashed.
 I mean, the whole flight back home, all she could talk about was how she's the one that can drop the veil between this side and the Other Side.
 What it means is, the myth about Silas being able to raise the dead is not just one, or some. It's every supernatural being over there.
 Three massacres, three hot spots, and the witch spell of the century, and every supernatural being over there is back with a vengeance.
 
 Hey, talk to me. I can help you.
 We shouldn't 
 Elena, I need you to calm down.
 I can help you. I want you to let me help you. 
 Turn it off.
 Just turn it off, and everything will go away. That's what you have to do. It's what I want you to do. Just turn it off.
 It wasn't, and you know it. This is the only way she's gonna survive. We'll help her, keep an eye on her. When she's ready, I'll use the sire bond to bring her back.
 Humanity means nothing when you don't have anyone to care about, Stefan.
 She lost her brother. I'm not enough, not this time.
 Yeah. Well...guess none of that matters anymore.
 I know, Stefan. 
 Elena, don't do this. We can find another cover story.
 She needs time. It's only been a couple days.
 
 Saves us the trouble of having to do it ourselves. I call that a win.
 Worst case scenario  I'll invoke the sire bond and tell her to turn it back on.
 Fine, we'll show her a good time.
 I know it's controversial, Stefan, but people actually like to have fun.
 There's only one way to find out.
 
 
 If you leave a trail of bodies, people are gonna start asking questions.
 I can't believe you're making me say this. Hey, 
 So that's the plan? You're gonna take her back to school?
 I don't know. Got a free meal out of it.
 Why are you here?
 Oh, yeah. The mayor put vervain in the water supply. 
 Fine, I'll go after the psychotic doppelgänger. Stefan, you wanna go talk to the Sheriff?
 Blondie, take her to school.
 Elena, it would make me very happy if you went to school today. And studied hard  you know, get involved in whatever activies, and please, for me, no matter what, don't eat anyone. Okay?
 
 It's called "Things You Suck At" 
 
 
 Katherine has the cure. 
 What do you mean, she fed? I specifically told her, No Feeding. The sire bond should make her listen.
 That's not possible.
 All I wanted was to break that damn bond. You're telling me now this whole time all she had to do was turn it off? What happens if she turns it back on?
 I'm at a truck stop in the boonies looking for a dead vampire that might lead to Katherine and the cure. 
 You. I thought you were still vacationing on Numbskull Island.
 Guess you won't turn into a real girl after all. 
 
 
 
 Stefan said the Mystic Falls Hospital had its entire blood bank raided, too.
 No. The guy's dying of a werewolf bite. He wouldn't have time to steal from both hospitals. This is someone else.
 That's another problem. But on the plus side, if our guy did by chance come here, he's got nothing, which means he's nearby and he's hungry.
 I want to find Katherine as much as you do.
 You have to take pride in your work. 
 I've been on the other side of a wolf bite. First you get really sick. Then you get really hungry. Since the sun's gone down, I'm imagining he's gonna be looking for his last supper. I just laid out a 3-course, 115-pound meal for him.
 Will?
 
 He was too far gone. I put him out of his misery.
 
 
 Do you really want the cure? I mean really? 
 Life sucks when you're ordinary. And what makes you exactly not like them? You're a vampire. You take that cure, become human, well, you're no one, nothing. Trust me. Losing this cure is the best damn thing that ever happened to you.
 
 Well, I'm not big on goal-setting, but let's just imagine a time when you don't wanna kill your best friend.
 
 You don't want to be like this.
 Hey.
 Out for a drive. I needed some space. It's not me, it's you.
 Okay, so...
 You know, I'm really not in the mood to scooby-doo our way through the case of the stolen blood supply, so why don't you hold the fort down until I get back, and I'll be in touch, brother.
 Yeah, well, emotions are overrated.
 
 
 No, I dragged you to New York because in a matter of three days, you managed to piss off everyone in Mystic Falls. A little more difficult to do in a city of millions.
 You were reckless.
 Look, all that matters is that when I lived here, I fed like crazy and had a blast and went undetected for years.
 There's no catch. Look, you wanted out, I got you out. You wanted to feed, I brought you to a city-sized, all-you-can-eat buffet. That's the beauty of New York  there's so much life that a little death goes unnoticed. 
 And that tone is the reason I didn't pick up the phone the first twenty times you called.
 Out exploring. Maybe she's eating a hot dog...vendor.
 Relax, man. This little joyride is actually a cure hunt. 
 That's why I didn't tell her.
 I'm aware of that, Stefan. What I'm hoping is that she's gonna be so wasted on booze and blood that she won't even think about it.
 If I can handle you when you flipped your switch, I can handle her. Trust me.
 Just be a good brother and keep Mystic Falls afloat for me and let me do my thing. 
 Looks about right.
 Well, it's early. Hedonism isn't a big fan of the sunlight.
 Easy, judgy. Not everybody got a hot new haircut today. 
 Because I spent most of the seventies here. The Factory was too clean, CBGB's was too high-profile, but Billy's  Billy's was the underground of the underground.
 There you go.
 That's the third five-foot-seven brunette I've gotten for you, Billy boy. Is it that same client?
 I kill people and give you their IDs, you let me feed in your club. Discretion was never part of the deal. 
 Lexi.
 
 Yes, and as I was explaining to Elena, before we were so rudely interrupted, that my history in this city has a particular resonance to her current situation. 
 Ugh. Would you mind? I can't even hear my prey over your constant babbling.
 So Stefan sent you? Hmm. I thought we were on the 'off' part of our endless on-again, off-again, eternity-of-misery cycle.
 "Leave It To Beaver." The fifties bored me.
 I'll take my chances.
 
 She had a Mother Teresa complex.
 You read the last page of the book first, too? I'm gonna go get a drink. Many drinks.
 Lexi thought the only way I would turn my emotions back on was if I started enjoying my life again.
 No. Wrong decade. 
 Pick.
 Your turn.
 Ugh. Packrat. Thanks, Will.
 So Silas is appearing as Professor Shane. Wouldn't be my first choice.
 You need me to come home?
 Eh, not great. I mean, it's no massacre in the making, but Rebekah trailed us here. Then in addition to my buddy being a brilliant identity thief, he's also a hoarder.
 Will had a repeat customer, 5' 7" brunette. Said she was a runner.
 Turns out I was helping her run from me. Ironic. Problem is I'm pretty sure that this filing system goes by birthdate, but I can't for the life of me remember Katherine's.
 And that, brother, is why you are the better boyfriend. 
 Yeah, tomorrow morning. Gotta keep up the ruse for the terrible twosome outside, pretend like I'm having a good time.
 
 Jealous mainly. He's having acid flashbacks of me and Lexi in the seventies in New York. I'll tell you about it over a drink. Come on.
 
 No.
 Every night.
 Every night. 
 I don't wanna remember. I mean, why do you care so much?
 Talking about Katherine's not gonna help me.
 Because she's not the person I care about.
 Because I barely felt it at first, but every night, it's gotten stronger. It worked. 
 On the bar, on the stage, on the roof. It was a very long night.
 Where you going?
 
 I thought you hated emotions.
 You're not missing much.
 
 
 
 Oh, for the last six months of my life, for the nagging, for the self-righteous platitudes. I'm paying you back for six months of you.
 Never was.
 A joke! A big fat lie. 
 Enjoy the day. I hear it's gonna be a scorcher.
 I was willing to do whatever it took. Sound familiar?
 Not my feelings. I'm looking out for you because one day, you will flip that switch back on, and all the bad stuff that you did is gonna come rushing back, and it is going to suck.
 She became a walking, talking reminder of all the awful things I'd done. And I managed to avoid her for decades, and then she just shows up in Mystic Falls to wish my baby bro a happy birthday, and boom  rush of memories, rush of guilt.
 Out of sight, out of mind. Every day that you're like this is the day that you might do the one thing that you can't take back.
 Maybe they were. Maybe hatred was the first one I got back. All the more reason to cure you. That way, we get the normal Elena back without all the ugly stages in between.
 Yes, you are, even if I have to break your neck or tie you up in chains until we find it.
 Where are you?
 You're in my car?!
 Let's just say it involves a 5' 7" brunette and her blonde accomplice.
 Wrong fantasy, brother. Unless you're into betrayal and snapped necks. The lead I had on Katherine, Elena stole. 
 
 If they so much as even scratched the paint on my car...
 Remind me to send her some mini-muffins. Do we really need ten gallons of gas, or are you making me just lug this around as punishment?
 Yeah, well I don't remember that name from the list of places I got from New York.
 
 Ooh, silver lining  if Rebekah takes the cure, then she's mortal and we can just kill her right then and there.
 Believe me, I learned my lesson. Elena without humanity is a stone-cold bitch, and I won't trust her until we get the old Elena back.
 Look at that.
 Something's not right. Katherine Pierce does not hole up in Hickstown, P-A.
 Points to them for their choice of vehicles.
 We do whatever we have to do. I don't care if we have to throw Rebekah under a school bus and wrap Elena up in a burlap sack. We do whatever we have to do.
 I am, too. I don't care what Elena wants right now. She's this close to going off the rails for good and that ain't happening. She's a pain enough as it is.
 That guy got his neck snapped in New York and this guy is royally pissed off.
 I see you got Katherine already. 
 
 Elijah's here?
 You're gonna broker a deal with Klaus?
 Nope.
 No sudden moves. No tricks either. No Katherine-ing.
 Wow. A quilt and a fish aquarium. Who the hell are you?
 
 Yeah, it doesn't look like the Katherine I know.
 Did it ever occur to you that you're not that deep? This whole small-town girl thing, we all know it's an act.
 Whoa, whoa. Hang on. We need her alive. The cure's not here. You check upstairs. I'll check down. I got this.
 So if I was a paranoid, distrustful sociopath, where would I keep my most prized possession?
 
 Aah! Gah! Vervain water. Looks like we have a winner.
 
 Let's just talk about this, like the two rational vampires that we are. Rebekah?
 Don't do anything stupid.
 You forgot the part where I was bobbing for boxes in vervain water.
 Sorry. It's Rebekah. I didn't have a pony to distract her, Stefan.
 Slight problem with being alive-I can kill you know.
 
 All right, you're right. I let Rebekah take the cure. 
 My point is, I'm sorry, okay? I had a moment of weakness, Stefan. It's my thing. It's like you and I falling for the same girl. It's our thing.
 What are you talking about?
 
 It's a chance I'm willing to take, Stefan.
 What's up with the silent treatment? You're the one that texted us and wanted to meet up.
 Yeah...no.
 Oh!
 Still ready to ride off into the sunset?
 So how long's it been? Eight, nine days?
 If we lost count of the consecutive days in which Elena Gilbert has not killed anyone, I'd say that's progress, brother.
 She doesn't want the cure. She's gonna start killing people if she knows we're still trying to get it for her.
 Yeah, how're you gonna make an emotionless vampire want anything?
 So what are we gonna do? Pull a Lexi and bombard her with emotions till one of them sticks?
 And what happens when she gets slammed with every emotion she's repressed since Jeremy died?
 Right. 'Cause you don't wanna keep reliving history, and when this is all over you're just gonna get out of her life.
 All right. How do you wanna do this?
 Yep. We're just here to make sure you hold up your end of the deal. Don't eat the prom queen.
 May I?
 Wow, would you look at that. Aw. Beautiful dress.
 Where's the disco ball?
 You are underage.
 Oh, come on. What badass senior's complete without a prom date that's slightly too old for high school?
 Oh, I'm sorry. Your...boyfriend. 
 You're not gonna deny that I'm your boyfriend, now, are you?
 Yeah, well, hindsight is almost a bigger bitch than you.
 Really? Then why tell me you're in love with me? Why tell me it's the most real thing you've ever felt in your life?
 I'm taking a little breather.
 Yeah, because you all crazy and brainwashed is just not a good look.
 What? no. She's safer here in public around all these people. There's no way Silas can make everyone see the same thing all at once.
 What happened to you being over it?
 Well, I mean, for a guy who's ready to move on, you seemed pretty convincing as a boyfriend out on the dance floor.
 Like her feelings for you?
 Hm.
 Ugh! Silas. Where's my brother, you psychic freak?
 Stefan?
 Let me guess  an extremely handsome man came up to you claiming to be me?
 Yeah.
 Damn it, Bonnie.
 
 She might not feel much, but she's gonna feel that in the morning.
 When Bonnie was whaling on her tonight, I could see it in her eyes. Elena thought she was gonna die. She was scared.
 Last time I checked, one of those pesky human emotions.
 You care to talk about our other problem? You know, the one that can be anyone, anywhere, anytime.
 I wouldn't underestimate his talents. He fooled the hell out of both of us.
 What did he say to you anyway?
 Hm.
 
 You coming?
 She's the calmest desiccating vampire I've ever seen. I remember when you starved me down there for three days. I would've wept at your feet for an orange peel.
 How hungry does she have to be before we can torture some feelings back into her?
 So what are we supposed to do in the meantime?
 Wow, look who went and got bold. Last time I checked, Klaus was plotting your eternal demise.
 You look terrible.
 But I do. That's the whole point. I do care, you don't care. It's about time for that to change.
 How does that make you feel? Hurt because I'd betray you? Angry because I'd cause you pain? Or scared, because you know it's gonna get a lot worse?
 What is wrong with you? Don't you wanna be with your friends? Graduation parties, caps, gowns, you know the drill.
 Relax. I just wanted to show you all of the things that you've been missing out on since you took the giant leap over the cuckoo's nest.
 Let me guess  prom? Beautiful dress, gorgeous hair, you trying to murder Bonnie? It's a good thing I was there to take care of you.
 Yeah, well, we had to keep you weak so I could bring you here. See, the way I figure it is, if I can make you nostalgic, then you're already halfway to getting your humanity back.
 Well, there are other ways to provoke an emotional response.
 How you doing in there?
 Come on.
 Is the old you ready to come out and play?
 Okay. Back you go.
 
 Good, you're awake. Thought you could use a little sunshine.
 Looking for this?
 Oh, you know the rules  bad girls don't get nice jewelry.
 No. I kinda like you in the hot seat. Whenever you're ready, brother.
 You don't think so?
 Tsk. Worth the risk.
 Bet that feels better, huh? How about a little gratitude, or any human emotion whatsoever, and we can stop this?
 I didn't quite catch that.
 Bingo! See? There's a little rage. I should've figured that'd be the first emotion that came out of you. I tend to pull that out of people.
 Wow. That was downright vindictive. See? I think now we're breaking through that tough candy shell and getting into the ooey-gooey rich center of your humanity. This is good. 
 You're gonna thank me for this. After you turn it back on, you'll realize life with no emotions blew.
 Every other vampire turns it on, no problem. You kill, you feed, you do all the awful things that a vampire does, and then when you're done you turn it back on. Why is she being so stubborn?
 No, she wants to come back. Scaring the hell out of her should've worked. She's smart. She knows we're not gonna hurt her.
 Who?
 Katherine?
 So we call her and then what, beg her to help us out of the kindness of her own heart? Are you kidding me?
 Seriously? You can't knock?
 You got a better idea, prom king? Unless you want me to lock you up in there with her, I suggest you shut up. Let the adults handle this.
 It didn't have anything to do with the fact that Elena called you out on your recent boy trouble, could it? Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear.
 Are you trying to get a rise out of me? 'Cause my emotions are fine. I love Elena. I despise you.
 What?
 Donovan, you're coming with me.
 Because Elena's hungry and missing. For once, his life might actually have purpose.
 Enough! You are acting like a little spoiled brat, you know that? You think that we can't punish you. Maybe not. But I can sure punish him.
 Shut up! I'm done playing nice. Turn your emotions back on right now, Elena, or so help me god, I will give you something to be sad about. I will kill him right here in front of you.
 Don't "Damon" me. She doesn't love anyone? Fine. Prove it. And if I'm wrong, what difference does it make? One less busboy.
 How about now? You feel anything now? You angry I just turned your buddy into roadkill? Or are you sad that the guy that everybody loves is just a bag of bones? Remember when he was a little kid, huh? Warm heart, big goofy smile, his whole life ahead of him. I guess it was a good idea that he was wearing this.
 You feel that weight lifting off your chest? That's joy, because your friend isn't dead. That's emotion, Elena. That's humanity.
 You're gonna be okay.
 Look at me.
 Elena.
 Hey, it's okay.
 You okay?
 Hey. Here you go. How you feeling?
 Whoa, hey. What are you talking about?
 I don't think that's what he meant...
 You just missed the doughnuts.
 Help, yes. Prolong the inevitable? Waste of my time.
 I'm not avoiding. Elena's only goal is to end Katherine's life, and that's not gonna just magically disappear with pilates and a juice cleanse.
 Why were we invited?
 Whoa.
 Or a doctor with some very questionable bedside manners.
 Silas wants Bonnie to do a spell to drop the veil from the Other Side.
 It's an invisible wall that separates our plane from the plane of all dead supernatural creatures. Now, Silas wants that to go away so he can take the cure, die, and not have to spend an eternity in a supernatural purgatory.
 Next full moon. Tomorrow night.
 So much for needing a full moon.
 Looks like Bonnie Bennett has a new doppelgänger friend.
 And where exactly might that be?
 Someone's an eager beaver.
 Now I get it. The one brother shoots you down, you ask the other one. Great.
 Do you not notice all of the end-of-the-world crap going on right now?
 Elena, we don't need to list all the reasons that I hate Katherine. What we need to do is find Bonnie. Come on.
 They're together, okay? So maybe you should do a little less threatening and a little more looking. Come on.
 If I remember correctly, I think there's an entrance in the basement.
 You hear that?
 You're gonna have to stay here.
 We really need to stop Bonnie from doing the spell, and if you get all murderous and screw it up 
 As self-righteous as Stefan is, he has a point. Behind your rage, there is a tidal wave of feelings - all of your guilt, all your grief, every emotion you've ever put off, and killing Katherine's gonna let it all in. And if you can't handle it, then we're back to square one.
 She's strong, and crafty, and you'll die.
 So this is either really good, or really bad.
 I'd say the feeling is mutual, except a lot of people aren't exactly who they say they are around here.
 See, now this puts us in a bit of a pickle, because that is exactly what Silas would say.
 Ah, hang on. If I can see you...
 Well, where is everybody? I figured with the veil down, it'd be like Ghost-a-palooza.
 I'm more worried about the ones looking out for their enemies.
 Perfect.
 You got any good news for me, Donovan?
 Call Stefan and tell him about Caroline. Tell him to keep an eye on Elena. God knows he'll do a better job than me.
 Who knows. I know she was sired to me. I know her emotions were off. I know she's so full of rage, she wants to rip Katherine's head off.
 Call Stefan.
 Bonnie? Bonnie?
 Yep.
 No, you're not. I've spent more time in these tunnels than I care to admit, and there's no way you just came from the school. Your mind games don't work on me, Silas.
 What the hell is happening?
 Who exactly might his true self be?
 Well, there's a slight problem, Medusa. Even though you turned him into stone, if he gets one more drop of blood he's back to his old mind tricks.
 It'll never be enough time.
 Stop. The most important thing right now is Jeremy, and saying goodbye.
 Calcified Silas is one heavy son-of-a-bitch.
 Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have some place better to be?
 I thought you were cutting back.
 You heard that? Well, that's not creepy.
 What the hell am I supposed to do with this?
 Lexi, back from the dead. Goody.
 
 Yeah. Got ya.
 So if you and Ric and little Gilbert are all flesh-like and real-seeming, that means something went horribly wrong when Bonnie tried to put that veil up. And here you two are, having dance party USA.
 Are you drunk?
 Well, I guess that's one way to celebrate our supernatural apocalypse. 
 Vaughn?
 Come on, man. I didn't kill you.
 Hey.
 Yes, we do. But first– 
 Sure you can. Looks like it might be cherry-flavored.
 Elena– 
 Well, I guess that answers the sire bond question. 
 How is it even when you're dead, you're the bane of my existence?
 Come on, we don't need the cure for Silas – he's a calcified statue.
 Nothing.
 Elena, there are children present.
 Because the bullet was laced with werewolf venom, okay? The hunters are dicks.
 Klaus would rather see me die. Plus, Klaus is a thousand miles away sipping Hurricanes on Bourbon Street.
 And here I was, so moved by your speech to save mankind. 
 Here.
 Digging up Silas. 
 Here we are.
 It's where I dumped Silas. Closed off to hikers, no food for animals, endlessly deep water.
 Well, um...well, let me see. So I dragged his stone ass through here, I flung him in that general direction, then he tumbled down into those weeds...I kind of lost him in the rocks. The thing about physics...wait, what is it? It's, ah, distance equals velocity times time? Guess I should've told you to bring some scuba gear, huh?
 
 
 Ding-ding-ding. Not as dumb as you sound.
 
 Yes. Yes, that.
 Hi.
 Yeah.
 Fresh as a daisy.
 I wanted to apologize...
 Let me finish. I said I wanted to. And then I realized, I'm not sorry.
 I didn't say you were supposed to be okay with it, I just said I'm not sorry. But you know what I really am? Selfish, because I make bad choices that hurt you. Yes, I would rather have died than be human. I'd rather die right now than spend a handful of years with you, only to lose you when I'm too old and sick and miserable and you're still you. I'd rather die right now than spend my last final years remembering how good I had it and how happy I was, because that's who I am, Elena, and I'm not gonna change. And there's no apology in the world that encompasses all the reasons that I'm wrong for you.
 Stefan?
 Yeah, I don't think anyone's gonna stumble on him there.
 You want me to, ah–
 
 Yeah?
 Thanks, brother.
 Yeah.
 She's trying to find Bonnie and Jeremy. She's worried about the time.
 What?
 
 Well, with you looking over my shoulder, how can I?
 You okay?
 Well, it is. You're leaving tomorrow. You're trading all this for communal showers and a meal plan.
 I'd rather ply you with champagne and spend the night convincing you to stay.
 Caroline just pulled up.
 You're leaving. You're going to college. You're gonna drink cheap beer and you're gonna protest things you don't care about. And I am gonna take care of your little brother. Trust me, 
 Well, I personally plan on forgetting about you the second you walk out the door.
 I love you.
 All right. Off you go.
 Yeah, no, we're not doing this. Go to school.
 What? Wait a minute, how'd that happen?
 Compulsion – it's the unwanted roommate repellent.
 Right, so then just compel her ass out the door.
 Look at you, giving it the old college try.
 Yup. Showered, groomed, even cut the crusts off of his PB&J myself.
 Exactly. Listen, I got to, uh...go.
 Katherine.
 You're miserable.
 You're a liar. Your hair's messed up, your nails are chipped. You're a sad and miserable human being and you want me to turn you. So, here.
 Go ahead, drink up. I'll kill you, you'll bite the mailman, you'll be a vampire again. Go ahead, come on.
 And that would be tragic.
 What are you doing here, Katherine?
 When I get back here, you're gone.
 Then run. Run far away.
 Wish I could say it gets better.
 Why? So you can keep dying and coming back to life? You've felt nothing but sheer agony for three months. You hallucinate conversations with me to have something to do. Just turn off that pesky humanity switch.
 Yeah, but it'll turn off your misery. Your fear, your hopelessness.
 One day. One day where you don't screw it up.
 You're lucky you didn't put one of those idiots in ICU.
 Yes – in the privacy of your own home! Away from prying eyes, unlike you who went all hunter in the middle of a hallway. You got expelled, genius.
 I compelled Principal Weber into a very genereous three-day suspension. Elena does not need to know about this. Finish eating, meet me outside.
 Stefan. Welcome home.
 Look, I get why you haven't called me back all summer. I wouldn't call me back either.
 How do you know that?
 Right.
 Great.
 What are you talking about?
 Silas is gone. Bonnie turned him into a big piece of rock, remember?
 That's impossible.
 I just watched him walk through a crowd of people that saw Stefan. There's no way he could fool that many people at once. I mean, he's psychic, but no one's that psychic.
 Get her out of here. Don't tell me where you're going.
 God, you're slow. Guess vamp-speed came with the upgrade.
 First, drop the Stefan look.
 What?
 If I have to hear the word 'doppelgänger' one more time, I think I'm gonna actually have to learn how to spell it.
 A  Get out of my head. B  I think I'd know if my little brother had an evil twin.
 Well, whatever you are, your plan didn't work. The cure's gone. Now, what do you want with Katherine?
 You're not getting her.
 Where's Stefan?
 How far'd you get?
 You pick now to listen to me?
 Good. Turn around, bring her back.
 Anyone ever tell you that's creepy?
 Jeremy! Gah!
 Open your eyes, Jer. You do not get to die on me, you hear me? I'm supposed to be taking care of you, you little punk! Wake up, or I'll kill you myself!
 I don't care.
 You're thinking about it. Flip the switch, brother. Put yourself out of this misery. Please.
 You don't deserve this, Stefan. You did the right thing – you walked away. You let us be happy, and this is what you get in return? How is that fair? Hey.
 Just turn it off. Turn it off.
 Hey, sorry it took so long to call you back. Car trouble.
 Oh, some idiot broke the window. Based on your voicemail, sounds like your day sucked worse than mine. You all right? You wanna come home?
 Yeah, it's probably for the best. It'll give me more bonding time with your brother.
 Goodnight.
 Nor did I tell her Stefan's missing, Katherine's in town, and you got expelled.
 No, I withheld a bit of the truth, so that Elena wouldn't drop everything and come running home to help. I'll figure all this out.
 "And I love you."
 "Katherine."
 "If I have to hear "doppelgänger" one more time, I'm gonna have to learn how to spell it."
 "Where's Stefan?"
 You okay?
 Well, it is. You're leaving tomorrow. You're trading all this for communal showers and a meal plan.
 I'd rather ply you a champagne and spend the night convincing you to stay.
 I'm aware of that. I mean, clearly that's why we wanted to dump Silas' body, here — because it's big and deep and no one would find him. Now, say I'm Silas, and I wanna take over my doppelgänger's life. Why wouldn't I dump him in a place that's big and deep, where no one would find him?
 But it's a place to start. And if Stefan's down there, that means he's been drowning over and over again all summer, while I've been happily playing house with Elena. Do I need to further elaborate the source of my urgency?
 Thank you, Liz.
 Please tell me you found her.
 Huh. How shockingly...useful.
 How exactly did the Gilbert-Donovan brain trust put all that together? Never mind, it doesn't matter. Just hide her. If Silas wants her bad enough to sic the whole town on her, that means we want her more. Stay out of sight. You were the last person who Silas saw her with.
 You want me to beat him up?
 Did you compel him?
 How about violence? Did you threaten him?
 Would you at least tell me you used torture?
 You do realize that you are dating a reformed serial killer, right?
 Pfft, that, I have no idea.
 I don't know. Probably mope at him.
 What?
 Elena, woah, that is not S—
 Caroline. No one cares, no. Hey, where's Elena?
 Silas is here. He's with Elena, pretending to be Stefan. Get dressed.
 Join the club. Get dressed.
 What?
 Just put some clothes on. Meet me out there. We have to find her.
 Where the hell's Elena?
 That's 'cause you haven't had sex with me.
 You expect me to believe you came all this way just to talk to her?
 Because he wants to hurt me.
 Gee, thanks, Caroline. Your hindsight is invaluable in this situation.
 Have you seen Elena Gilbert?
 Wrong answer.
 He turned the entire town square into a hunting party for Katherine. How am I supposed to calm down when every single person here could be working for Silas?
 All right, before you get mad—
 Mm. Wait. Wait.
 As much as I'd like to do this right now...
 Silas got into your head, didn't he? What did "Stefan" tell you to do?
 You're in some sort of Silas-trance, but I think you snapped out of it.
 Before you ask, no, he's not in the quarry. It's a common misconception. You talked to him today.
 Me? Yeah, I bet he had some choice things to say.
 Can we talk about this when you don't have that murdery look in your eyes?
 It must be Silas' mind-control. He's using your anger at me, like a trigger. You have to resist it.
 Elena, you have to resist it.
 I don't know. I've had more important things to worry about.
 Yeah, well so is protecting your brother, finding mine, and figuring out what the hell Silas wants with Katherine.
 You're getting angry at me again, Elena. Remember — trigger.
 Elena, that is the gas. Stop. You don't really wanna kill me, Elena. You have to realize this before you're gonna break Silas' compulsion.
 Well, you're gonna have to think about something stronger than your desire to kill me, or you're gonna kill us both.
 Stefan. Stefan. Think about Stefan. Caroline told me you've been worried about him, that you had a pit in your stomach. Describe it, tell me about it.
 Think about him. Think about the feelings you're getting. Describe it to me.
 We will. I swear.
 Well, I guess that's how a hero would do it. Honesty — who'd've thunk it? Aren't you the least bit curious about the whole Nancy Drew and the creepster-professor thing?
 Yeah, well...
 Snagged it from Silas yesterday. And, for the record, I am secure enough in our relationship that you having psychic dreams about your ex-boyfriend does not bother me...but it still sucks.
 Yeah?
 Well, you were right. He was hungry. I bet he still is.
 Stefan's been drowning over and over again all summer while I've been playing house with Elena.
 You did the right thing, Stefan. You let us be happy, and this what is what you get. How is that fair?
 Stefan's been drowning over and over again all summer while I've been playing house with Elena.
 Silas wants you bad enough to the whole town on you, but we want him more.
 What?
 Uhnn...You must have restless sleep syndrome or something. It's like sleeping with a tornado.
 Hey. We were up all night. You're exhausted. Come back to sleep.
 Oh.
 I know I said it didn't bother me that you have some psychic connection to your ex-boyfriend, but I don't need a play-by-play, Elena.
 Fine. Tell me. I'm sure whatever's in my imagination is ten times worse than what's going on in your subconscious.
 Well, should I go check in the attic, see if there's a crystal ball? Maybe you can conjure up an address.
 So I've found 9 bars along Route 29, and none of them are called "Joe's".
 It doesn't sound crazy—it is crazy. But I'm open-minded.
 Trust me, I have no interest in Katherine's well-being, but for some reason Silas wants her real bad, and if Silas wants her, I want her more.
 All right, play nice, or I'm gonna revisit the deep dark well idea.
 Okay, train's leaving the station. Choo-choo!
 You sure you know what you're looking for? Last bar had a red awning and a neon sign.
 Didn't ask you.
 Ignore her. As soon as the vervain's out of her system, we'll compel her and we'll put her on mute.
 The only time she shuts up is when she's sleeping, and I didn't want to disturb our peace and quiet.
 I thought you said this was the one.
 Yeah. It's a lot of freaky. Let's go see if Stefan's inside.
 Yeah, sure. 
 
 Did you know this woman?
 Hmm. I could. Thank you.
 
 Who the hell are you?
 Wonderful. Now we've got a vampire bounty hunter to deal with. Let me guess  Euro-bitch was not part of the dream?
 Yeah. Well, whoever she was, she wants Katherine, which means she's probably a Silas spy.
 Wait, what? No. She almost killed you.
 Wait. No. Stop. Just wait. Any sign of trouble, you let her go, do you understand me? I don't care how bad Silas wants Katherine. She's not worth the hair on your head. You got me? Okay? Kiss me. Go.
 Stefan. You couldn't call a brother?
 What the hell is going on here?
 Qetsi-whatever?
 Well, I guess the rumors are true. You are a ray of sunshine. Question—why is my brother wearing your compost pile?
 Well, that's a great idea, force the cure down his throat. The cure is gone, done, it's ingested.
 We have a lot to catch up on, Stefan. Wait a minute. What do you mean supposed to be with me? Did you plant those dreams? What is it, some kind of, like, witch party trick?
 We ran into a little snag.
 Okay, well, thanks for the hospitality, but we should really get going if we want to beat traffic.
 You realize you're not the only one with a bad side, right?
 What are you doing to my brother?
 All right. We're done here.
 Stefan. Stefan! Stef. Damn it. Whatever you did to him, undo it.
 Spying on us from the Other Side?
 Oh, yeah? What was that, realizing that your plan totally sucked?
 Look here, Miss Crazy, why don't we just dial down the destiny talk a notch, okay?
 If you're trying to downplay your reputation as being a psychopath, you might not want to say you're spokesperson for the universe.
 So, what are you suggesting, I leave him here with you while I run off and live happily ever after with Elena?
 You have a bad track record with men.
 No one would have to know?
 Or you could just go back to hell.
 Well, he's got his daylight ring back. We're all set for a picnic.
 Hmm.
 She told me that we don't stand a chance.
 Well, she told me a very interesting little story about the history of doppelgängers, how they're fated to fall in love with each other. Basically, the universe programmed you to fall in love with Stefan, not me, which means...We're a lost cause no matter what we do. I'm paraphrasing.
 Her words, not mine.
 Maybe. Maybe she's not.
 What, you think I am? I mean, no one tells me how I live my life, no one tells me who I love, especially not some vindictive prehistoric witch, and definitely not the universe. And I'm not gonna let someone else's idea of destiny stop me from loving you or being with you or building a future with you, because you are my life.
 Welcome back, brother.
 "I feel alive again."
 Nada?
 Brutal.
 Well, yes, and no. Technically, yeah, because you're a vampire.
 Realistically no, because you're, you know, you.
 And we're only in the 1920s, baby.
 You're a vampire, not a cave man.
 You're a man of principle, Stefan, who had his memories erased by a two thousand-year-old witch.
 Do you trust me?
 Nope.
 
 Yeah!
 Well, in the theme of morbid town tradition, you go back to the 1820s when everyone was so paranoid about the cholera thing that they would occasionally bury a body a wee bit before its time.
 Well, they were so paranoid that they would actually request to be buried with a string attached to a bell above ground, and then the whole family would hang around the grave for 24 hours in hopes of hearing the bell and that their loved one would come back, but now it's just really—it's really a kick-ass excuse to get hammered.
 Hello.
 Uh, hey, darling? We'd love another round, please.
 That, my brother, was you jonesing for something a little stronger than a blood bag.
 Well, unfortunately, Stefan, there are two types of vampires in the world, okay? There are those that can handle moderation, and then there's you.
 Right.
 Let's not try it out, okay?
 Two hundred years is a long time.
 Hey. I never said I know what I'm doing.
 Who are you calling?
 I'm on top of it sister. I've called her about ten times. She hasn't called me back. 
 You take one philosophy class, now you're the queen of nature versus nurture?
 You don't see that cute, little waitress anywhere, do you?
 Today, I'm the safe brother.
 Shh. You're kind of the one that killed her.
 Hindsight being 20/20, way too much temptation at the bar, so if this Ripper gene is biological, then we need to minimize human contact until we get your brain all witchy-wooed back to normal, so here it is.
 Mmhmm.
 Well, we've covered our father, who art in hell. 
 Ooh.
 I got to go see a man about a witch. Party on without me. Brother—for you. 
 Jeremy Gilbert picks up. Wow. It's a Remembrance Day miracle. Now tell me you found Bonnie because I have a hungry vampire who forgot that he's the hero of the story.
 And I need you to be less vague and less weird.
 Okay. Where is she? Call her. Get her here.
 I don't speak "crazy-person," Jer. You're gonna have to translate that for me.
 Yes, exactly. The beauty of Bonnie magic, which is what we need right now.
 No.
 Don't say it, Jeremy. Don't you dare.
 You say it, and everything in Elena's life goes to crap, do you understand me? Everything changes.
 Don't.
 Damn it, Jeremy! You realize what you just did?! 
 I'm at home. Look. I really need to talk to you about something.
 What? What happened?
 Okay. I'm on my way.
 What you doing there, brother?
 You sure you want to do that?
 I think we just got dumped.
 Elena, Bonnie can't help us.
 Bonnie's dead, Elena.
 She's dead. I'm sorry.
 Hey.
 I know.
 I'm so sorry. 
 Busted!
 Hey, Miss Avoiding-Me-For-Three-Days.
 Texting. One time. "Want to be my plus one at a costume ball?" Winky face.
 Definitely will maybe consider thinking about it.
 Where you going?
 So, as we know, in a psychotic lapse of judgment, Bonnie brought you back to life and died in the process. May she rest in peace.
 Whatever. Look. 
 Something Elena doesn't need to know about until it works.
 Same reason you answered. You need help, and I'm gonna help you.
 From the beginning, Silas' whole bad-guy plan was to kill himself, pass on to wherever he was gonna pass on to, and reunite with his dead girlfriend, Amara. I want to use his death to bring Bonnie back to life.
 Well, for starters, you're still here, as in, why do you suck so badly at killing yourself?
 To die, he has to be mortal. If he's mortal, then he's a witch, and if he dies as a witch then he's stuck on the Other Side forever.
 She knows I can't hear her, right?
 Really?
 I thought you said you lost all of your psychic powers.
 Back to my original question. Let's say Silas destroys the Other Side, cures himself, becomes a witch. Is it supernaturally possible that he can do a spell that swaps her life for his life once he pfft kills himself?
 What'd she say? Tell me?
 So, we have a deal.
 Well, you've yet to tell me what you want.
 Lady Anne Boleyn. Now, who in their right mind would cut off a head so gorgeous?
 Well, maybe I can dance my way out of this doghouse.
 Ooh, or maybe you can tell me what's going on with you. Come on.
 Ah, guilt. Don't know it, but I've heard it can be a real bitch.
 Elena, you are allowed to be happy once in a blue moon. Besides, Jeremy was lying to us all summer.
 Who the hell is that?
 More like an "I'm sorry" keg.
 Trust me, last guy to hit on her is still paying for it.
 Well...
 So you want to explain to me why I just killed my brother?
 And this severed the link?
 Sold.
 Isn't Tess going to be slightly suspicious when the man whose brain she just fried is all of a sudden showing interest in her?
 Yeah.
 Oh, the new you sucks.
 He'd know it wasn't about him.
 I'm gonna get her best friend back, okay?
 You awake? Stefan? 
 That ain't Stefan.
 Looks like Tessa had her way with him.
 So, Professor Blondie knows about vampires?
 Ugh, that's not good. 
 Yeah. Well, neither is a desiccated Silas in our living room.
 Yep.
 Now, who could that be? 
 Thrilling. 
 He needs the cure to become a witch.
 Good bye, Katherine.
 
 Takes a licking, keeps on ticking.
 
 But it is our life, which probably means that somebody's going to walk through that door and shatter it.
 
 Six...five...
 One...
 What's with the home invasion, Silas?
 Alright. Skip the mushy parts. Look. My girl here is just trying to have a good day, and there are promises that she's expecting you to keep.
 She's trying to have a good day. Just tell her how it's going to go down.
 New Jersey? The supernatural other-world is bound by an object in Snooki's backyard?
 AKA, put the damn crossbow down, Pocahontas.
 No, he's not serious.
 That makes no sense.
 Hey! 
 Look. Who knows? Amnesia Stef's a fickle little 
 Silas needed his psychic juju to get into Tessa's head and the only way to temporarily reactivate his abilities was to break Stefan's neck...
 No. Just let Stefan have his space. It's like you said, he's already mad enough.
 Well, who?
 Thank God.
 It's called being secure. I'm assuming you know a little bit about that by the way you wear your hair. Please don't tell me you believe in this doppelgänger prophecy crap.
 You do realize that by destroying the Other Side, that you are personally moving Heaven and Earth to be together. That's not fate, you idiot. That's you being a crazy person.
 What do you mean you have no idea?
 Wait. You don't know where it is or what it looks like?
 Why are they so interested in this anchor?
 You know, you might be an all powerful witch, is that what you call it?
 But I will happily kill you if you keep that up.
 Well. Isn't this a pleasant surprise.
 Gladly, but he's such a control freak, he wants to off himself himself.
 Yeah. I'm not following.
 Stop! Stop it. 
 Whoa. Wait!
 Yeah. Well Tessa wants to do it now. Something tells me patience isn't her strong suit.
 You don't think I'm aware of that? But if Tessa kills Elena, guess who's not going to make it to Bonnie's welcome home party? The plan's off Jeremy. Bonnie's not coming back. Sorry.
 I've met a lot of witches in my day. Never quite heard that one before.
 Let me guess. Travelers.
 Why do you witches always go for the daylight ring?
 I was about to do you little euro-tribe a favor. I wanna kill Silas too.
 Well, that's not gonna work for me.
 
 
 For what?
 But they're not immortal, so who do they want it for?
 What? His favorite childhood sled?
 No way.
 Not possible. Tessa may be insane, but she's a bona fide genius.
 two thousand years old, immortal, indestructible. The anchor isn't a thing. It's a person.
 She never killed Amara.
 Are you?
 Stefan Salvatore sleeps in his own bed tonight. Does that mean he stopped hating us or did the power of the doppelgänger universe push him into the car with you?
 Victory in a day otherwise marred by failure.
 What?
 Well, Silas is M.I.A. 
 Elena, meet Crazy Pants. Crazy Pants, meet Elena.
 October 1852.
 But not on purpose. 
 So Tessa just gave you back your memories, no strings attached.
 Whoa! Easy there, buddy.
 Uh, well that is...
 Of the doppelgänger variety.
 No, nope, not Katherine.
 Tessa turned her into a block of rock, left her in a box for two thousand years, probably went a little stir crazy like those deserted island guys who talk to volleyballs.
 Yep. She's the anchor.
 As long as she's alive, the other side exists, and we can keep trying to get Bonnie from over there.
 You'd think, except last night she stuck a hole in Silas' neck, sucked the cure right out of him, so now she's not only nuts, she's mortal, which means we have to keep her ordinary little human heart beating until we get Bonnie back.
 Silas made a pinky promise that he'd do a spell to bring her back. Unfortunately, he's taking his sweet time coming back to Mystic Falls.
 Ah! Amara, stop.
 
 Well, look who decided to pick up his phone. Is your secretary out sick?
 You're taking a bus? Not to sound like a dick, man, but we're in a little bit of a rush over here.
 This is not a time to have an every-man crisis. We need you back here to resurrect Bonnie before your nutter butter soul mate offs herself and destroys the Other Side.
 Pardon me?
 Not till you bring Bonnie back, remember? Promises made, metaphorical hand shook.
 Silas is a witch. He's a living, breathing, GPS tracking device. He'll track her wherever we take her.
 Then she's not crazy crazy, she's just talking to dead supernatural beings roaming around in our basement.
 Oh, please don't say who I think you're gonna say.
 I was hoping we could talk.
 You remember Amara,right, brunette, brown eyes, I'm surprisingly not in love with her?
 Well, she took the cure, she wants to die, and we have her.
 For now. Silas is literally on his way to kill her. He's completely obsessed with destroying the Other Side so that he and Amara can live happily ever after in the great beyond. Man, you were right about these doppelgängers. They do always end up together. So how does it feel to say, "I told you so"?
 See? That's what I thought. So, how would you feel about us making a deal?
 So, here's my pitch. In order to keep the Other Side in place, you need something to anchor the spell, right, something powerful, like an immortal being powerful. Now, Amara was obviously a great choice until she downed the cure.
 So, would you consider someone who's dead but stuck on the Other Side a viable candidate?
 Because I've got a volunteer.
 So what's the problem?
 Fine. Name your poison.
 Think hard. I have a girlfriend at home who misses her best friend and a wacky stowaway on suicide watch. It's ridiculous.
 You want doppelgänger blood? I got doppelgängers coming out of my ears. How many do you want?
 This way.
 Electricity's out in the whole house. What happened.
 Well, Silas owes me a fuse box. Hang on. I only count two doppelgängers. Where's crazy pants?
 Stefan and Amara are not inside.
 No. He's luring Silas away so he can finish this. It's typical Stefan. He'll be fine.
 Okay.
 No! Amara. No. Amara, Amara. 
 No, no, no. Okay. 
 What's another five minutes, huh? Hey!
 No! Amara! Come on. Please.
 Amara. Amara! Please. Amara!
 Anytime you start with "This is gonna sound lame," guess what? It is!
 Well, that was an embarrassingly close call. Maybe I should be there so you don't spill all of our secrets and make out with a moody mystery guy.
 Speaking of moody, or making out? Either way, he'll never show. His memory is back, and he remembers he hates us.
 Well, I'll be sure to relay the message.
 Stefan? 
 What I want is to be drinking copious quantities of booze and making out with my girlfriend, but unfortunately, I can't do that until I get a bunch of answers out of you. 
 These? 
 That explains it. I know a lot of people like you. Science over medicine, right? Let me guess. You use these 
 Not in the mood to talk? Fair enough.
 We're going to play a little game, where I inject you with whatever the hell "necrotizing fasciitis" is.
 Gross. So, I'm going to do that and I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions, and if you answer me correctly, I'm going to give you some of my delicious vampire blood and we'll heal you on up. If you don't answer me correctly, we're just gonna have to see how much flesh these little guys can eat.
 Turning a kid into a vampire so you can experiment on him? Harsh. What is it about this place that turns people into mad scientists?
 Yeah, but don't people usually volunteer or sign waivers? Maybe get some dough for tuition?
 I'm not the greatest guy in the world, but sounds like some Mengele-level crap that you're spouting out. So I gotta ask, what is your greater good?
 Well, rabies was a bust. 
 Well, that's awfully ambitious of you. 
 Ebola. 
 I'm not buying the good doctor bit. 
 Well, what exactly does he really crave?
 That's what Doogie said, and apparently once he starts, he can't stop.
 As of now.
 Okay, okay, okay. I won't kill him. Bye. 
 Easy there, killer.
 In case Professor Forbes forgot to tell you in your training, sweetie, I'm a lot older than you, and that means I'm a lot stronger than you.
 What the hell did they do to you?
 Aah!
 
 She didn't have a choice, all right? Once he had the taste of vampire blood, there was nothing stopping him. Go ask Dr. Frankenstein. I'll go deal with him. 
 Actually I'm gonna wait until I can compel all this out of your head.
 What the hell's that? Why does this say 12144?
 Because I was 21051.
 Augustine. I haven't heard that name in decades. Vampire lab rats, coded subject names. I thought you guys shut down 60 years ago.
 You know how I said I wasn't gonna kill you? I lied.
 Hey. I'm looking for Joseph Salvatore.
 Love what you've done with the place. If this whole boarding house thing doesn't pan out, you can always turn it into a high class brothel.
 Well, he doesn't call, he doesn't write. Of course, neither do I. In all fairness, I am the one that abandoned him on a train platform in the middle of World War II.
 Eh, not sure I got one of those in me.
 
 
 What the hell are you doing to me?
 Wes? Why am I here?
 
 
 As much as I would like a free checkup, 
 
 What the hell are you talking about?
 Listen. How I got this amazing body has nothing to do with science, so running  aah! 
 So you Augustine freaks are still at it, eye exams and that sort of thing?
 
 Hey.
 I'm fine. Wes injected you with vervain. Maybe when it wears off, we'll be able to  
 Wes is carrying out the grand Augustine tradition. Getting his kicks off vampire torture.
 He didn't have to. I've been here before.
 
 Kept me in this very cell, and don't think I haven't appreciated the irony.
 Five years, give or take.
 Believe it or not, I made a friend.
 
 Dr. Whitmore was working in a battlefield hospital when he discovered Enzo was a vampire, so he drugged him, locked him in a coffin to ship him overseas.
 
 What future?
 I can see it.
 People are full of surprises. 
 
 
 
 Well, the girl I was trying to impress was more of 
 Never met another one like her.
 
 Where'd you meet her?
 Charming?
 
 Ah.
 
 Well, you know, 
 Why are you doing this to us?!
 Points for optimism. But unfortunately, Stefan doesn't even know this place exists.
 Yeah, and in the first year, I'd thought he'd rescue me. He didn't. Once I escaped, there was no point in giving him more to feel guilty about, so I never told him what happened here. I never told anyone.
 They let us out of the basement once a year.
 
 
 
 But on the plus side, that's how Enzo came up with his plan.
 Are you sure that will work?
 Paper covers rock.
 
 
 It doesn't matter, Elena. I got strong, I got out. It wasn't pretty. All you need to know.
 You don't want to know, Elena.
 
 
 Now you see it.
 Vervain!
 
 So I chose to save myself.
 I'm sorry, Enzo.
 And I knew if I was going to save myself, that I had to stop caring about Enzo. So I turned off my emotions.
 
 
 
 Great. Mini-Wes.
 Slick hands, cowboy.
 And you thought it was Elena?
 Calm down.
 Not the one that killed your parents. That was all me.
 
 Yes. I can see it. 
 
 And that's exactly what I did.
 Since 1958? I lost count.
 A few months ago. Her name was Sara. Had to go all the way to Charleston to find her. It was a weekend trip. You didn't know.
 Starting the summer of our lives.
 
 Oh...
 
 
 Ditto. Elena's not here by any chance, is she?
 
 
 I'm gonna barf.
 
 Aw, you know, being held against my will, shot in the head, now I can't find Elena. 
 I mean, she's not picking up her phone, she's not in her dorm, she's nowhere in this house, which leads me to believe that Dr. Creepy Ken-doll has her somewhere.
 Yeah, the one that operated on vampires during business hours, yeah, that one. Put your hero hair on, Stefan. Let's go get Elena. 
 
 Pop quiz. 
 That's my brother Stefan, but I'd watch your tone with him because he's kind of in the midst of a psychotic break.
 Oh, come on. You don't think I know about you and Katherine?
 More like disturbed. 
 
 We're gonna call Wes, and you're gonna tell him that if he doesn't give us Elena the next experiment that he conducts it's gonna be sewing your arms back on.
 Aaron is Aaron Whitmore, and he comes from a very long line of vampire-probing, blood-testing, organ-removing freaks called Augustine.
 Because I was their test subject in the '50s.
 Meaning I donated my body to science except I was alive and it was against my will.
 Don't get all guilt-ridden, Stefan, on me. We were on the outs back then, and by the time it was over, you know, it was over.
 I don't remember anything.
 Which one is it?
 
 It's been a while, mate.
 
 
 What part of "he doesn't care" are you not registering?
 It was the 1950s. I'm supposed to remember every moment of my life? 
 
 That's a timely revelation.
 
 
 No.
 What do you want? You want me to feel guilty? I couldn't save you. Now, where's Elena?
 What's wrong with you?
 
 Look at me. If you go back, we go back together. We finish this for good. Come on.
 
 I want to find my girlfriend.
 Enzo, look at me.
 Where is he? Where's Elena? Tell me where she is!
 Enzo, look at me. Hey! Enzo! Where is she? Where is she?
 Oh. Never mind.
 Well, I injected you with a bunch of these that say "antidote" and apparently, one of them worked.
 I don't care about amends, mate. My girlfriend's safe, so technically, I'm not suffering, and it'd really suck if you desiccated in vain...
 ...and I'm gonna tell you my side of the story. You asked me if I thought about you after I escaped, and answer is no, and I sure as hell don't feel guilty about leaving you because in order for me to save myself and leave you, I had to shut off my humanity, damn it, so I flipped the switch, and then I felt nothing, no remorse, no regret, no pain.
 We're even, Enzo. 
 Sure you want to give yourself nightmares reading that thing? 
 A hundred pages of horrific torture, and you find the one happy passage.
 Yeah. And dissected vampires along the way. News flash, Elena. You are a vampire. I mean, do you honestly think that he would sit here and see you as anything more?
 
 
 Well, now I'm choosing, and I'm choosing to let you go.
 I am choosing to not have to think about how you must feel every time some ghost from my past comes into our life. I'm choosing to relieve you of having to defend me for every awful thing I've ever done.
 I won't change who I am. I can't...But I refuse to change you.
 I can hear you, you dumbass.
 Rule number one  Name the worst thing Katherine Pierce has ever done. Rule number two  Toast to the glory of her impending death. Rule number three  If you come across something that's worse, which you will, repeat rules one and two. She pretended to be buried in a tomb for 145 years, while I waited for her lying ass.
 Wait...Does that beat pretending to be Elena and kissing me on the front porch of your old house?
 I don't think so either. Damn.
 Quarterback, go.
 Think on that.
 Little Gilbert.
 Doozy.
 Double doozy. Drink.
 Yes she is...Because I wouldn't have even been in town to turn Vicki into a murderous vampire if I wasn't trying to get Katherine out of a tomb she wasn't in.
 Group shot!
 And Alaric.
 Rumor has it, she burnt down the entire city of Atlanta once.
 Come on, Stefan. Don't let the sight of a frail, human Elena-look-alike cloud your memories of the manipulative psycho that she is.
 Exactly. Bottoms up.
 Please. One night of hot sex with her and you're brainwashed?
 That's why you never send a busboy to do a man's job.
 Nadia...the devil's spawn. Caroline, did you remember to tell Elena that?
 Uh-uh. No way. Even my biased brother knows I will kick his ass from here to Kentucky if he helps Katherine Pierce live one more day on this Earth. No volunteers.
 What a mess.
 Okay. I'll say it. 
 Sword in the daddy...nice touch.
 So tell me how this slaughter went down again? Oh, that's right. Klaus was going to kill you in a blood sacrafice and you, being you, ran for the hills. Only to come back to find your entire family had been massacred. So, if I'm adding this up right, your family's entire death was all your fault.
 Liz...
 Every awful thing i've ever done is linked to her. She taught me how to kill. I don't enjoy it. She ruined me and I can't take any of that back.
 We're not on a speaking basis.
 Poor Aunt Jenna. I had to compel her to think she walked into that knife. She was so confused!
 I'm sorry, did you actually think that that was real? Nope. No one's coming to say goodbye, Katherine. Because no one cares.
 Ouch.
 In a shocking twist, Katherine's daughter is a psycopath. Whew. She's all yours. I've had fun messing with her mind all day.
 I know, Stefan. I know. It's been a rough couple of days. I needed an outlet, okay?
 And Katherine pulled you out of it. Irony abounds.
 You think I don't know that? I can't live without her, but when you think about it, I'm no better than Katherine. Elena will be happier without me.
 What? I'm being selfless. Don't give me that look.
 Katherine-fricking-Pierce has a selfless moment, I'm not allowed to? Fine...fine...When I get Elena back, and the whole universe freaks out because the fated doppelgängers are torn apart, just remember you...you're the one who pep-talked me out of doing the right thing for the universe and all mankind.
 You do that.
 Rick's here?
 He's talking about me, isn't he?
 Cheers, buddy.
 Ding dong. Does that mean the witch is dead?
 Just out.
 One who hovers and sticks his nose in other people's business. Oh! Sorry.. I defining 'annoying.'
 Katherine's rotting corpse was stinking up the house. I got rid of it.
 Why is that?
 You're out of luck.. you ain't getting it.
 and nothing gives me greater joy than denying her dying wish.
 That bitch ruined our lives. Nadia has known her what, 5 minutes?
 The nicest thing that Katherine Pierce will ever do is feeding the maggots that feast on her flesh. Give it up. You're not giving her back.
 Come on. Katherine is exactly where she always belonged. I'm not giving the body back. Quit giving me that damn pouty face.
 It's your fault for telling me to get her back.
 You're enjoying this a little bit too much.
 Who invited you? Scram.
 You? You hate me! You once told me that calling me Satan was an insult to Satan.
 Mmhm. So this is what it's come to? You bring me love advice from Prudy Trudy?
 What's going on here? Are you guys babysitting me?
 I don't need this. And I don't need your help.
 Enzo...
 You missed a spot.
 Didn't we already do this? You tried to make me feel guilty, I saved your life. We're even.
 Well you know me... I like to keep my promises.
 You brought me Aaron Whitmore
 Alive....
 I'm just curious, but do you ask all of your friends to prove their loyalty by killing someone over drinks?
 Would you believe he's a friend of a friend?
 Hmm.
 I hate that line.
 I can't kill you. Long story.
 Go back to college, pack up your entire life. There's one road that heads out of town. Take it north until you hit ice. Don't ever come back.
 Donovan, are you in here?
 What's wrong?
 What's wrong? Say something... please.
 Yeah. I want to talk too. The message thingies on your phone... that was all me, in case you deleted them and didn't listen to them.
 So you know how bad I screwed up? I wussed out, Elena. I bailed because I was convinced I'd ruin you.
 I know. Just hear me out... just hear me out. You are literally the best person I've ever known and for me to think I could change you gives me way too much credit; and you... not nearly enough. You are the best influence on me. I need you. You are the good.. And I need a little good in my life. Because without it, there's an awful lot of darkness.
 I know, Elena, but...
 Yeah. Okay.
 What are you talking about?
 How is this about Katherine?
 Come on. Deep down, you gotta be enjoying this a little bit.
 I did. I tried.
 She's the reason that I'm here! No, scratch that, I'm the reason I'm here.
 I want the same thing you want, Aaron. Go back in time, fix the past, get someone back I've lost.
 Either way, I did it. I tore them apart. I liked the sounds they made because I realized they deserved it. Like you...
 I use to think that. Yeah. I had to be better to deserve her love, or she had to be worse to accept mine... I'd lay in the middle of the road, looking up at the stars and having conversations with people like you, trying to convince myself that killing them was a bad instinct and that sparing their lives was the right thing to do.
 It doesn't matter. The point is, I was conflicted. Right now, in this very, very moment, I am crystal clear. You see, Elena thinks I'm a monster. You know what? She's right.
 Hey. Sorry about the mess. I had some company and things got a little out of hand. (He tries to sit up.)
 Ah. I let Enzo drive last night. He's a little out of practice. Almost ended up in the damn foyer.
 Oh. You mean Aaron.
 Yeah. Well, last night, we hunted him down, and I ripped his throat out. Yeah. I just figured it's time to shove the last branch of the Whitmore family tree into the... wood chipper. (He drinks from a bottle.)
 Oh, you know how it goes. I mean, I left him for dead, he tried to kill me, we worked things out. You spend 5 years with someone in a dungeon, you have a pretty unbreakable bond. (He gives Enzo the bottle over Stefan's shoulder.)
 I happen to like my old sadistic self, Stefan. In fact, I miss that guy. That guy was dumb enough to try and change himself to get a girl.
 So, get another hobby, brother, because I'm not in the mood to be saved.
 Scrapbooking.
 On the contrary, brother. I'm better 'like' this.
 I'm not thinking that far ahead. Rise and shine, Dianne! How's our favorite head of Whitmore security?
 Now, Dianne, tell the truth. Did you cover up a vampire attack on campus by forging a suicide note or two?
 Now I want you to tell me exactly where I can find Dr. Wes Maxfield.
 Well, that's a shame, Dianne, because that makes you a dead end.
 Onto the next.
 It's like driving past a car crash except you 'want' to look away.
 I tutor some kids in calculus. You know, I like giving back, be a good role model. Kidding! I'm here to kidnap your boyfriend.
 You're not going anywhere, buddy.
 Or what? You'll glare at me to death? You don't have your little magic wand to back you up anymore, Bon-Bon.
 Ooh!
 Relax. I'm here for you, not her, you idiot. Keep up. Anyway, I have this hit list, and I can't find my last target so basically, I need a witch.
 Grams ran occult studies. I'm sure we could throw a rock and hit a witch around here. So listen. Take this  this is Wes' blood. My buddy Enzo kept this as a souvenir. Now this should jump-start a locator spell. Tick-tock.
 Elena would what? Hurt me, dump me? Been there, done that, wrote the country song.
 Cool. And then me and all her doppelgängers could start a baseball team on the Other Side.
 Well, I'm feeling lucky.
 Oh, don't worry. I'm not her date. We're not going to break any Bitter Ball rules.
 Well, Bonnie is going to find me a witch to do a locator spell on the elusive Dr. Wes Maxfield. She's going to find him, I'm going to kill him. Bon-Bon, should I tell them?
 How long is this going to take?
 Is that a good sign?
 Witchy hotline. How may I help you? Damon speaking.
 They seem to have lost motivation. Maybe you can inspire them.
 Thank you.
 Just so you know, cooperation's not optional.
 The spell worked. Wes is in Richmond.
 I wasn't planning on it.
 Nah. He's all yours.
 I was there for Elena. We're done. No reason to go back.
 You saw his face. I know that look. He's done with me, too.
 You've gotta be kidding me.
 Close. Travelers.
 I don't know.
 What I can tell you, if he stuck me with that cannibal vampire poison, we might have a little problem.
 Wes has this sick little scheme to destroy vampires by making them feed on each other.
 Do you hear that?
 Psst.
 I'm going to go ahead and say 'karma.' Karma is happening to me.
 Probably. Then she became one. So he drank himself into oblivion   she cheated with the pastor.
 There's no love in there. Look at that picture, it's old! The milk maid's no where to be found   it's just pathetic old farmer John.
 I doubt he'll mind!
 Are you timing me?
 Or, you can just leave.
 Good boy.
 Pastor? Pastor?
 Well, my brother likes to make a big show  set them up, put their heads back on and pretend like it didn't happen. I, on the other hand, couldn't give a crap.
 Crowded.
 It's the obnoxious theme song of the travelers.
 Ahhh. No!
 Funny you should ask, I was just craving a blond.
 The spell can't last forever.
 You're pretty zen about all this.
 Always the soldier.
 My brother told me to leave and not come back. I'm not calling him.
 They won't come
 I'm not going to feed on you. I'll find another way.
 They're not gonna to let us out of here until I kill you, or you kill me.
 There's no cure, Enzo. Not for this.
 Because when I stay, I destroy things.
 What the hell are you doing?
 I thought I told you not to call them!
 Or they'll come and I'll feed on them.
 Go Enzo! I tried to kill you, I'll do it again.
 GO ,ENZO!
  Elena. Don't. Do not.
 I said don't!
 If you come in here, you ain't coming out.
 I wanted revenge. I got stuck with a vampire virus.. almost killed my last friend.. Typical Damon.
 You can't help me! I feed on vampires now. You're both vampires. Do yourselves a favor and leave.
  Stay back!
  No. No No.
 You gotta get out
 What the hell is wrong with you!
 Elena!
 Get away from me, Elena.
 Ahh. I know you can't help yourself, but if you bring home a rabid animal, you're gonna get bit. Ahg.
 I'm going to kill you, Stefan. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but at some point, I'm going to rip open your throat and you're going to die.
 and let me guess, it would bring you no greater pleasure than to teach me.
 She has.
 Mhmm.
 Do you remember the vampire ripper, Jesse? When he attacked me, Elena had to kill him, but if there was the slightest chance that there was another way to stop him, she would've taken it.
 She knew it would be impossible for me to resist her blood and then she just kicked you a stake and essentially told you to kill me.
 You gotta another excuse?
 That's what I thought.
 She is brilliant.
 Yep.
 Mhmm.
 I'm trying figure out why you decided to tell a starving, bloodthirsty, vampire-feeding Ripper that his nemesis is still walking around, alive and well, while I'm stuck in this cell and can't do anything about it.
 I would love to hear this.
 What are you doing?
 
 That was nothing!
 Caroline?
 Manage me?
 I'll deal with my own crisis. Listen, you just let me out of here, I'll find Wes, I'll get the antidote.
 Who you calling there, buddy?
 
 Oh you know, strung up, hungry, same old same old.
 Okay. Sure. Why don't you just come to the house and we'll just talk about it here?
 Okay, bye.
 Unless...
 She was testing me. 
 Nothing a little locator spell can't fix...
 
 Or, you can give me a couple of sips of your hybrid juice, I can be on my way, and take my Ripper situation to Wes!
 Can I ask you a question? Without you getting all wolf-man on me?
 Why are you still here?
 Oh no, here-here. In-Mystic-Falls-here. Your family is all dead, and I don't see you getting a job at the Grill. And, I don't see you in a Whitmore hoodie, either. Something tells me that there is a little masochistic voice in your head thats trying to convince you that you and Caroline still have a fighting chance in hell.
 Hmm, you're proabably right.
 There's just one small difference between you and me. You wanna hear it?
 You see, even after all the terrible things that I do, Elena still chose me, because she's fighting for me. Caroline, on the other hand, chose the nuclear option. You know, that big red button that nukes your relationship once and for all. Well, sleeping with the guy that killed your mom was kind of her way of slamming her hand down.
 I plan on it. How's New Orleans this time of year?
 Says the guy pinning for the girl that slept with Klaus
 I know how to get you in this cell.
 
 I called my friend Enzo and asked him about the little adventure he had with you. Gotta say, long way off the tenure track, huh? I take it the Augeutine Society hit a bit of a rough streak?
 Well then, I guess you're my guy! Because, you see, I have this long road ahead of me to win my ex-girlfriend back. But, I dont have a chance in hell if I'm lusting over her blood, you follow?
 Look at me! You did this to me
 It's my turn to play doctor.
 
 We've already done that, Kitty Kat. I've said all I needed to say.
 I'll see you in hell, Katherine.
 Why is she not waking up?
 Relax. Thanks to Tyler's friendly donation I'll be fine for a couple of hours.
 Tell her everything I did.
 I don't wanna be another Katherine Pierce. Katherine spent her whole life running from her problems only to die here. All alone.
 Elena?
 Are you...you?
 Hilarious.
 Give me the damn cup.
 Wipe that smile off your face.
 Quit crying! You're still around.
 No, she doesn't because I'm going to be the one to tell her. If either of one of you clowns beat me to it, I'll rip your tongue out.
 Don't you even think about it!
 I killed you once before, Gilbert. I'll kill you again.
 Hey you.
 So... eaten anyone yet?
 Ahhh. Yeah. It sucks. You're going to be craving carbs constantly, but hey, you know what? There's a plus side. You get to keep your girl's figure.
 Well, how retro of you! Does that mean you memorized my phone number?
 Ahhhhh! That would explain all those crazy instagram pics you've been uploading lately.
 Kidding! Kidding!
 I know.. I'm sorry. Well, what'd you want to know? I'll tell you..
 How did she do what?
 Oh... that.. I don't know. It's not like it has been playing on a loop in my head over-and-over again.. So, I don't really remember.
 Well, it was all downhill from there.
 Elena.. The second we are cured of this and don't want to rip each other's heads off, I am going to hunt you down and give you the most mind-blowing night of your life.
 Can we talk about the irony of Katherine Pierce sitting through a college lecture.
 No way! If anything, there's some sucker probably compelled to spend his entire spring break doing your homework.
 Aaron? What the hell does he have to do with anything?
 Well.. uh, you probably won't find him.
 No reason...
 Stefan, Stefan, Stefan.. "I have grease on my shirt. I need to wash up?" Come on, man! That's the oldest trick in the book.
 I wasn't the one making out with her!
 What do you mean, werewolf venom?
 I should come over there.
 Oh yeah? Well.. never mind. That would be awful.
 Alright. What are you wearing?
 Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see.. Umm.. It's been unseasonably cold; Jeremy bought a bunch of new x-box games that are ridiculously loud and obnoxious; Tyler had a party.. It was lame.. OH!  OH! OH! Have you heard the gossip?
 Caroline and an original hybrid.. sitting in a tree.
 Yep!
 Mhmm.
 Yep. And guess who told him?
 That she is.
 Are you okay?
 Uh. That might be easier said than done. Wes is dead
 I killed him. And please don't act like he didn't deserve it!
 I know. Look, you're sick. So just try to relax.
 Stefan will be there really soon.
 What?
 Listen Elena, I will tell you everything, but right now is not the time.
 Elena... woah, woah, woah. Calm down. Listen to my voice. You will get through this. I will help you.
 Elena, calm down! Please?!
 Donovan! Get your ass in here.
 My phone's dead. Charge it for me.
 How about you never say that again?
 I need to see your sister. Undo my chains, or I'll kill him.
 She's going to hurt herself, Jeremy. She's totally unravelling.
 Stop being an idiot, Jeremy. Trust me. She needs me. I  would never hurt her, Jeremy.
 Elena.. Hey, it's Damon. You're hallucinating.
 Here. Drink this It's Stefan blood. Drink this.
 Don't say that.
 I'm here. It's okay
 No.
 Waitl! Look at me.
 Look at me. You did not kill Aaron Whitmore. I did.
 It was before I was infected. Listen, if you want the specifics, it was the night that I thought you broke up with me, Elena. I killed him to convince myself that you were right. That I was the type of person that can kill in cold blood and I was never going to change. That's why.
 I need you to say something..  Please?
 She speaks. Care to share anything else churning around in that beautiful head of yours?
 What?
 You don't think I know that?
 Katherine didn't do this. I did! I thought you broke my heart, so I ripped open Aaron's neck  THAT is how much control you have over me.
 Listen to us! This is toxic! We are in a toxic relationship, Elena! I just killed your friend and you find someone else to blame!
 Thank you!
 Then stop loving me!
 Well, that's the problem! We don't work!
 Then we agree? This has to end.
 Good morning, sunshine!
 No, I've been up for three hours.
 Neither did you.
 Maybe we should keep making mistakes? Big ones..
 Your loss. I make one hell of a naked breakfast.
 You know, that is so incredibly insightful, Donovan. You're really street smart, for someone working behind that bar, for what is it, 3 years now?
 Tyler Lockwood's now a life coach, despite running his own life into the ground. Perfect.
 Because it's diffcult to explain to your brother that you just broke up with the former love of his life, and then broke the bed.
 Besides, I've got you two idiots.
 Mystic Falls amateur therapists.
 Less and less by the second. Anyway, Stefan's not an option. He's off doing some research project with Caroline. Don't worry wolf boy, I'm sure they're just friends.
 Well, pull up a chair girl, tell the professionals your problems.. just talk slow and use small words.
 Well boys, I hate to cut the session short, but unlike you, I have other places to be today, but don't worry, I'll be back. I've got deep, dark, childhood trauma that I'm just itchin' to talk about.
 The clock's busted. What am I paying my PTA dues for? I am gonna file a complaint.
 You left me in charge of Jeremy when you went off to Whitmore. I've had this on my calendar for months.
 Why? Is there something else you want to talk about? Oh, come on. Don't pretend like you're not still tingling from this morning.
 Right, well, speaking of hypotheticals, if Jeremy was running around with another girl, would you wanna know about it?
 Bonnie's little witch trainee, Liv. I saw her and Jeremy sharing a top shelf bottle of inhibition killer at the grill this morning.
 Again, need I remind you that he once had an affair with a ghost. The only thing missing was a sappy love song and a pottery wheel.
 Ex-boyfriend – ex, right?
 Someone's in desperate need of a less judgy counselor
 You're making excuses for someone you love. That's what you do. The worse the behavior, the more you try to defend it.
 Yeah, because you keep trying to make it about anything else!
 Here's the thing, Elena, I don't know what to say, or do. or think. All I know is that right now...
 I want to rip your clothes off right here in the middle of this hall, and throw you into one of these classrooms and kiss every square inch of your body, while a bunch of people that drive minivans listen, wishing they were us. That's probably a bad idea, right?
 Right
 See you in class...
 Lucky us. First one's here.
 You okay?
 Elena. Elena? Earth to Elena.
 Little tip, if you're going to stop to kill someone, don't waste time feeling bad about it.
 Hardly. She was two seconds away from killing you and I wanna know why.  So, I'm going to rip this nasty rag out of your mouth and if I hear so much as one syllable of hocus pocus, one of us is going to break your neck. Spoiler alert  It's gonna be me.
 Talk.
 Alright
 You don't get to tell me what to do anymore. We broke up. Remember?
 Tempting, but not until you talk.
 If it's between you and this psychopath, Elena, you know what I have to do.
 Well, that's your choice. The only way you're going to get to make it is if you're alive. Please tell me YOU understand that!
 She tried to stake your sister, you idiot. She's going to do it again.
 How? You can't even get a passing grade in penmanship!
 Oh. Ugh. You can't be serious!
 Penny for your thoughts?
 The guidance counselor? And how would she know about the crap we're dealing with?
 Jeremy's whole life is bad for Jeremy. You wanna fix Jeremy? Put him on a plane and get him out of town. We did what he wanted, remember? Against my better judgement, I might add.
 The man of the hour. Where are you going, little Gilbert?
 Put the bags down, we'll talk about this in the morning.
 Something tells me you're not packing for our honeymoon.
 You realize that you leaving doesn't solve anything, right? I mean, especially now that Jeremy's free and clear of our horrible influence.
 I'll drive you to Whitmore.
 Shh.
 Travel safe.
 Jeremy was having some trouble at school.
 I'm fine. We're just taking some time apart.
 Does your mysteriously missing girlfriend know how insufferable you are? Maybe that's why you haven't found her. She doesn't want to be found.
 Right. Now you're here annoying me.
 You know, bringing up her name defeats the purpose of me trying to forget about her.
 Whatever. Speak of the devil.
 Damon one, temptation zero.
 What?
 Yeah.
 What's happening?
 Tom?
 Wait. What kind of visions?
 I don't need to know that. Where's Stefan?
 Find a witch, get her over here. Let's figure out what the hell's going on.
 Hi.
 Yeah. I figured pool was a good outlet to put this pent-up energy that I seem to now have.
 Yeah.
 Drink?
 Well, wouldn't want that.
 We're not doing anything. I think that's part of the problem. We're just standing clothed, just standing, doing nothing.
 Oh.
 So having sex dreams about my brother.
 Well, I just thought I'd skip the uncomfortable parts.
 I'm gonna regret this, but... By any chance are fantasy Elena and fantasy Stefan really, really, really happy?
 Right. Well, as your friend, let me state the obvious that the prophecy says that you two are fated to be together. You're supposed to be together.
 We're all good on bibles, thanks.
 Liv has a twin? Is it possible for there just to be one of someone around here?
 Come on in.
 What do you mean you can't stop their visions?
 Then why are you are in my house?
 From where? Chant camp?
 And let me guess  the witches don't know where Markos is.
 Well, this just keeps getting better and better.
 Aw, you know, looking at the stars, listening to the universe laugh at me.
 We were doomed from the beginning, Elena. We were always gonna end up here.
 And then what? We're friends? Can't wait.
 Elena.
 Hey.
 Yep.
 Huh. Clear.
 I'm gonna staple your tongue to your chin.
 Markos I take it. Well, I'm not Stefan, and this is not Elena.
 I was about to ask you the same question. Plus, what do you want, and why are the doppelgängers having visions of each other?
 You?
 You mind telling me what the hell is going on?
 As in there is no prophecy?
 Oh, yeah. Picket fences, block parties, uncannily high death rate.
 I'm sorry. Are we walking so I don't fall asleep?
 And thus began the war between the Travelers and the witches, and it's still rages on and on. Sorry. I just nodded off.
 Let me guess  the doppelgängers can fix this. So you found them. Now what?
 Passengers. So how many of you are there?
 I think we need some rules here because if I'm not allowed to drive you home, then I definitely don't think you're allowed to ambush me in my bedroom.
 Oh. Well, I'm sorry to tear you away from paradise.
 I told you I don't want to know.
 Well, we can always ask Markos to put it back.
 And really bad for each other. Did you forget that part?
 As friends, right? Right. No, Elena. I can't be your friend. It's too damn hard.
 No. I'm serious, Elena. I can't see you anymore. I don't want to hear your voice, I don't want to talk to you, I don't even want to look at you, and I sure as hell don't want to be your friend.
 That's what I want.
 Dingdong! Invite me in.
 Oh, I'm so sorry I interrupted whatever weird ritual you two were doing, but I just want to de-passenger the great citizens of Mystic Falls using your magical Traveler knife, so hand it over.
 Five words that make want to vamp-toss my keys into your chest cavity. Little Gilbert, help me in the fight against my dark side and elaborate, please.
 As in you lost it?
 You're right. Don't invite me in because I will kill both of you.
 And when was the last time you heard from Tyler?
 You don't happen to know where I can find a Traveler, do you?
 I've got two brain-dead teenagers who didn't realize two plus two equals one hijacked hybrid.
 Well, what do you say  field trip? I mean, I'm sure there's some salvage yard we haven't toured yet. I think it's a little too dangerous to let tweedledee and tweedledumber out of the house. Last thing we need's another Traveler possession in our midst.
 How is it Travelers are everywhere until you actually need to find one?
 That's what I get for working with the Hardy Boys.
 Stefan burned his journals a while ago. He was in a mood. Why?
 How'd you hear that? Are you with them right now?
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, Enzo. You have your murder voice on. I need you to speak very slowly and calmly and tell me what the hell the problem is.
 Sixties? Stefan wasn't even 
 Blondie, now is not the time to be screening my calls. You're the only one unaccounted for, and I don't know where Elena and Stefan are. At least call your mother.
 You know when your brother kills your only friend's girl and you're stuck in the middle?
 Well, then don't ask.
 No, no, no. It has to be the eighth. He was very specific about the eighth.
 Ooh. Stefan was right. He didn't kill Enzo's girl.
 Because I did.
 Well, this is depressing. Stadium seating really necessary? These people are starting to creep me out.
 Oh, I'm sorry. Was that veiled? Release the damn hostages.
 There are sides now?
 Enzo, I get it. The prospect of seeing Maggie again was your safety line to the outside world, the one thing that kept you from shutting it off. There's probably a chapter in Elena's psych book about it. What, are you two study buddies now?
 The thing is I didn't know she was your Maggie.
 She didn't tell me her name when we met.
 November 8, 1960.
 Oh, yeah? What are you thinking  "Life" magazine?
 Whitmore. I spent a lot of time there.
 Vividly. It was incredibly hot, very loud, lots of screaming. So I heard.
 Sensitive readership. Got you. See, I have this switch in my brain. Feel something I don't want to feel... Click, it's gone. Easy as pie.
 I'm not a fan of needles.
 Oh. An Augustine. How refreshing of you to find me. I usually have to hunt you people down.
 Maggie was the hope Enzo clung to. You were mine, and when you didn't notice that I was missing for five years, let's just say I held a grudge.
 I didn't even bat an eye. My switch was off, Enzo. But I didn't do it to make your life miserable from every angle. I did it because I didn't care. Just do whatever it is you got to do. You want to kill me, you want to hate me, do it. This is between us.
 Don't you dare! Hey, Enzo!
 Yep. Emotion-free. Bye-bye humanity.
 What do you say we get out of here? Where was it that you wanted to go  cape town?
 Even better.
 No. Bastard. He took Elena. Let's go.
 You deal with her. I'll find Enzo.
 I can handle him.
 I said I could handle him.
 The witch is dying.
 Enzo, I need you to come find me, ok, and I will give you a first-class ticket to Cape wherever it is. Hell, I'll even come with you. I mean, let's face it. No one's gonna miss me here, but don't hurt Elena, ok? You leave her alone, I swear I'll never ask you for anything again.
 Elena! Elena. Agh!
 You're okay.
 I know. I know what you're thinking. I screwed up. I'm the reason Enzo's in our lives, I'm the reason he wants us dead. It's all my fault, and I'll fix it, ok? He was there for me when I was at my worst. I'll find a way to be there for him. I'll get him back. I'll fix it. Did I leave anything out?
 Yeah, I know. I found her on campus. She was unconscious, I took her home, tucked her in.
 I think I'm past trying to earn points for good behavior, Stefan.
 That's very noble of you, brother. We both know it's not the truth.
 I can't.
 What, you're the only one that gets to play hero? Or you just don't think I can do it?
 You don't know what you're talking about, Stefan.
 Yeah, because you know what you never knew? The whole time I was in that cell, every time I'd say something terrible about you or blame you for not coming to rescue me, Enzo would bring me back from the edge.
 Enzo reminded me that at least I got to grow up with a family, at least I had family still out there, which was more than he could say for himself. Said he envied me for having a brother.
 Even a crappy one like you. He defended you, Stefan, even though he didn't know you. Said it was good that we had people on the outside, people just living their lives free and clear of our Augustine hell, people worth holding on to our humanity for because we loved them. And all that time as a prisoner, every time I wanted to give up on you, Enzo stopped me from hating you. That's why I have to help him. And I owe him for that. And so do you.
 Well, you've been failing now for an hour, Wonder-Twin, so at this point, I can't imagine it's hurting.
 I don't think this guy's the best anything if his locator spell skills are any indication. Yo! Where's your sister?
 He flipped his humanity switch. There should have been a body count all the way to the airport.
 Gee. I don't know, Stefan. Vampire with no humanity who wants me dead for killing his girl. Hmm.
 He cured her?
 No one cares. Wait. Keep going.
 Markos said they can't settle anywhere without evoking earthquakes or hell-fire, but they break that curse, and they just move right on into Mystic Falls.
 Oh, well. Markos had a good week or two in the land of the living. Now where is he so can kill him?
 Well, good news. Our friend Luke here is an alleged genius at locator spells.
 Well, what about one of those locator spell blocker deals? Is that simple enough for you?
 Perfect. You avoid the entire Czech language, figure out how to find Markos.
 Well, you have a Traveler inside of you. I mean, I have probably-misplaced faith that you'll figure it out. Meanwhile, you and I and our ex-girlfriend are gonna go on a little secret trip.
 Cozy.
 Well, I hope that dickwad's spirit isn't floating around anywhere.
 I respect that he's dead. How about that?
 I'm supposed to be avoiding you.
 Yes. No. I don't know.
 You kicking me out?
 I'm really sorry Enzo came after you. That was my fault. He was hurt.
 It is a big deal. He almost killed you, Elena, so I'm gonna hunt his ass down, I'm gonna whip some sense to him, and I'm gonna make him apologize in person, ok? What?
 Hey, munchie. Those are not for you.
 "Area 51".
 "J.F.K. Assassination"? What the hell is that–
 What game?
 Well, Meryl Streep, I'd love to know how we're gonna act out Watergate.
 "A," you just implied that I was on your team. Two, you just gave me that judgy little hinty voice. So what am I missing?
 Speak.
 No. Clearly I don't.
 You know, now that you mention it, Elena got all cagey when I brought up Enzo.
 How much have you had to drink?
 Let the games begin.
 Ok. Let's play a game called "never have I ever", hmm?
 Come on. It'll be fun.
 Cheers to that one.
 Cheers.
 Tough but fair.
 Never have I ever lied about where Enzo is.
 I mean, clearly you know the rules of the game, right, brother? If you lied, you drink.
 Well, I could certainly use another round.
 Elena!
 Come here. Come on. What happened?
 Who?
 Ok. I'd blame it on the spirit of Bill Forbes, but I don't think you're his type. Besides, why would a ghost be targeting you? Hey. Elena?
 Enter the complication. Enzo's dead. You killed him. Elena told me.
 Nope.
 Yep.
 By all means, brother. At your convenience.
 Enzo! You in here?
 Because knock it off!
 Drowning Elena was just a distraction. He figured out a way to kill us all in one fell swoop.
 Crap.
 Who knows? We better find him before the Travelers find us.
 Nope, I don't.
 Let's just cut to the chase, Stefan, because I'm not in a hash-out-our-differences kind of mood. Yes, I'm pissed that you killed Enzo. I'm even more pissed that you two lied to me about it. You know what, Stefan? If it was me and I was in your shoes, I would have done it, too, except I would have done it months ago. The fact that you took this long 
 Yes, Stefan, he was my friend, which is why I, above anyone else, should have known that he was dead. Let's just find the stupid witch.
 What'd you think I was gonna do?
 When I found out Enzo was dead? Did you think I was gonna go on a rampage, slaughter a bunch of innocent people, go bowling with human heads? What'd you think I was gonna do?
 You hear that?
 Why the hell would Enzo dump him here?
 Smell that?
 Grab him. Let's go.
 Dick move, Enzo.
 If only this wasn't totally avoidable.
 This isn't gonna stop, Stefan. I killed his girl, you killed him. This is not gonna stop.
 You listening to me, Enzo?
 Is that a yes or a no? Because I can bring you back. Bonnie came back, Markos came back. I'll find a way, but this has to stop. How do you think you're able to do all this stuff, huh? The other side's falling apart, Enzo, so you can either help me, or you can blink out of existence. It's your choice.
 Go on, Stefan. Get Luke out of here. He's the only one that can hide you and Elena.
 Stefan! Go now!
 Bought what?
 Markos found his way back. It's not impossible unless you want him terrorizing us for the rest of eternity.
 Uh-uh.
 Had to do that for Enzo. That's the last time you'll hear about it from me.
 Hey. We're leaving. Pack your stuff.
 I'm in a hurry. You should be, too. The Travelers can find us.
 What's there to talk about?
 I don't care that you lied really.
 Because you were right, Elena. You wanted to protect me so I wouldn't spiral because if I spiraled then it would prove that we shouldn't be together, but but I didn't spiral. Despite every nerve in my body wanting to break something or hurt someone or do all the wrong things for all the right reasons, I'm holding it together the best I can, for you.
 Of course I'm still mad at you because being around you drives me nuts, and not being around you drives me nuts.
 Because I've had a really crappy day, and I needed it.
 Wakey wakey. Mr...
 Sikes.. Head of corporate accounts.
 Oops. Sorry about that! Yeah. Can't have you mumbling any of those annoying traveler ditties. It's a sure migraine. So, here's the deal. My brother and my girl have both been kidnapped by travelers and I can't seem to find them anywhere. I mean, like, POOF, gone. Right. So besides a completely clueless hybrid in my basement and a cave full of sleeping travelers, I've got nothing to go on except you. So I'm going to need you to tell me where I can find your leader, Markos.
 You know him?
 Well, unfortunately, Mr. Sikes here is occupied by some low-life traveler. I saw him and his buddies chanting in the town's square last week. I also know that Markos and your traveler comrades are planning some big, flashy spell to undo some super-boring, ancient, witch curse. And where that sucks for us; it just happens to undo all witch magic, i.e. kill, me and my sexy blonde frenemy here.
 Yep. Sorry. You're going to have to speak up.
 Hmmm. Nope. Didn't quite catch that either.
 Come on, sweetie pie.
 Seriously? Collect calls are still a thing?
 Four days.
 Woah! Woah! Woah! I've been searching 24/7, okay? Maybe if you would've been a little more perceptive, you wouldn't have gotten yourselves doppelnapped.
 What the hell was that?
 You have Elena participating in squirrel slaughter?
 Mhmm. She'll shoot your eye out.
 Don't psychoanalyze me, Stefan. Where are you? I'll come get you.
 Yeah. I know.. Find Markos; kill Markos; save Mystic Falls from becoming traveler home. It's going to be a busy day for me, Stefan. Time to strap on the hero hair.
 Get both yourselves home safely, brother. I'd hate to have to kick her ass for losing you.
 Hello! Still here. And I know what I said.
 Hey! I'm sorry. I've got two missing doppelgängers; I've got a traveler that wants to rid our town of magic; and I've got the friendly banker, Mr Sikes, in the coat closet. So your escape from the netherworld is going to have to wait till tomorrow.
 Then you bring him back.
 Liv is cooking up a spell to pull you back from the other side before it goes "kaboom." So whatever you're doing, just include Enzo in it.
 You hear me, Enzo? Just hitch a ride with her. Okay. See? There. Delegating. I feel better.
 You.. I need you and your x-box buddy to run an errand for me. Come on, let's go.
 Ahh! Great. I'm going to add carrying to the list of things you can't do well, but that's okay. You can repay me with your salary from the grill... if you want to work a couple thousand years.
 Just put her on the pool table.
 Traveler husks They've passengered themselves into the beautiful citizens of Mystic Falls, like your buddy Mr. Sikes.
 You two make yourselves useful. Patrol the town; call me if you see anything weirder than usual.
 Well, Markos put them in a cave. I'm hoping he wants them back.
 It's the only idea!  Unless your body snatched ex-boyfriend in the basement can help us.
 There's no shame in giving up. I mean, aren't we all a little sick of Tyler?
 Spare me the unsolicited relationship advice.
 Hey! You found my note! Now listen, don't be offended, but I can't just give them to anyone. So, what do they look like?
 You just described homeless people, aging hipsters, and Matt Donovan.
 I know the concept of a home is new to you, but it is polite to knock.
 I think you read the flyer wrong. See, the bodies are the only thing on the bargaining table... And in the attic... and in the garage.
 And in the kitchen...
 Funny! Here I thought you didn't have a sense of humor!
 Oh! If you're wondering about the smell, I have your salvation army doused in gasoline and I'm just itching to light a match.
 You want a promised land? I get it. Okay, but look  off the record, I mean, Mystic Falls is kind of a dump... bad schools, terrible traffic.. and forget about ever getting a decent cup of coffee.
 Very poetic! No idea what it means.
 I think I've heard about enough.
 I'd invite you to stay for dinner, but I'm not very familiar with traveler cuisine. Although I'm sure it involves a lot of trail mix and gruel.
 Well, all I can ask is that you leave me with a couple good bottles of wine. You know, I spent half my life shop-lifting stuff. I assume you want to see the wine cellar?
 That's a good question. Why don't we find out?
 After you.
 Well, Stefan isn't picking up, so. He might just be out of cell phone minutes.
 It took you long enough!
 What?
 Woah.
 We have a problem
 Little Gilbert. I have never been so happy to see you.
 What was that for?
 Well I guess today is your lucky day.
 I'll call you in a few hours, Jer.
 We'll bring him back. Come on. Let's get away from prying eyes.
 You said you had a plan, Bonnie.
 And you lost her!
 Then find another one!
 You need motivation because if the Other Side goes away, everyone we know there, including you, goes away with it.
 My brother is over there.
 So is Alaric, and so is your grams.
 Well, if it's not Mr. Butterfingers himself. How'd it feel to have your only hope of coming back literally slip through your fingers?
 Well, then get on it!
 Class is in session. First assignment—Anti-magic perimeter. Gilbert, whataya got?
 Meaning what, your biceps shrunk, and your brain got smaller?
 The cemetery's outside of the no-magic perimeter, a couple of un-populated areas other than that.
 Donovan, you had one job.
 Nope. You should not be. You are on witch duty because without crazy locks, no one's rising from the dead. So next order of business, mass murder. Quarterback?
 Thank you. OK. We got these from the Sheriff. Apparently there was some truth to her evacuation story. There's a major gas line that runs underneath the town. Now if it did leak, it could be deadly, as in massive explosion kind of deadly.
 Says one of the only people left in this group who can actually live there.
 And that's where your mama comes in. She will convince them to gather somewhere inside. Meanwhile, these two geniuses at 7 00 will turn on the gas, let it leak. We'll have about 10 minutes before anyone can smell it. You clear out. Boom! Travelers gone, resurrection spell starts, loved ones return. Good? Good? Class dismissed.
 Operation Massacre... assuming Donovan knows the difference between a water-main and a gas-main.. yeah, I'm good.
 Listen.. I wanted to spare you the gory details, and then I figured, well, I'll be lying, and then the whole point of saving the universe would be moot because you'd be pissed. So here it is; Project Kaboom needs someone to trigger the explosion, so-to-speak.
 Elena, I've seen it since the second I laid my eyes on you.
 Listen... technically, it's only half a suicide mission because we're going to be bringing people back from the other side and I'm going to be with them.
 Alright... not to relive old fights, but this is my choice. I need you to respect it.
 I will make it back to you, I promise.
 I promise you.
 What the hell are you doing?
 Woah. No. No. That's not how this works, Elena. The second we cross the border, you're going to feel everything... You're going to drown all over again. It's going to take you back to the night you died as a human.
 I know...
 Okay.
 Liz! No. No. No. No.
 Where's Elena?
 Okay.
 Well, would you look at that...
 Even if I wanted to apologize, you couldn't hear me... so I won't.
 I don't have a choice, baby. You are, by far, the greatest thing that ever happened to me in my 173 years on this Earth. I get to die knowing I was loved—not just by anyone—by you, Elena Gilbert. It's the epitome of a fulfilled life. It’s never gonna get any better than this. I peaked.
 I love you, Elena
 Bye.
 This place is going down, isn't it?
 I don't kn—
 Can we go back to the part where Rick came back to live to be a college professor?
 Well, the fact that you can say that with a straight face is one more reason that I love you. (smiles)
 Can I ask why there is not a Bennett witch in the back? I mean, can't Luke whip up a batch of herbs in Bonnie flavor?
 Or you just know that Bonnie would agree with Luke. The last thing you need to do is conjure up someone who's gonna tell you the truth.
 About what? The fact that I'm dead? Because I am.
 Good point. Now I'm just gone.
 And this conversation is pretty much the smart, level-headed you talking to the irrational possible drug addict you. Which is clear evidence of your insanity.
 What are you looking for?
 Easy. This is when you wipe her slate and let her go.
 You're gonna kill her, just like you nearly killed the last one and the one before that and the one before that.
 One call from my brother and you're gonna throw all this away?
 So, why am I here? Do you want to move on? Move on.
 For what?
 Elena...
 You're still holding on.
 I don't blame you. You know what's waiting for you. How long before you go running back to Luke?
 An eternity of torment, agony, and grief. And you feel it all.
 You'll feel it forever.
 And every day I do it anyway. Bon appetit.
 Huh. That got awkward fast.
 Where are you going? Hey.
 Well, I feel a fang. I'm still a vampire. Either I'm a dead vampire or Mystic Falls is no longer magic free.
 I definitely blew that up about an hour ago.
 Where the hell are we? And I don't mean geographically.
 Katherine.
 I'm Damon.)
 Well, that's not true. You want what everybody wants.
 Yeah, they're all 20 years old or more and yet they look brand new.
 And that is Elena's not-so-burnt-to-a-crisp house.
 Look.
 I don't think we should be asking where we are, I think we should be asking when we are.
 No, you know what? If I'm going to feel guilty about something, I'm going to feel guilty about this.
 Where is any booze in this empty retroville?
 Alright, talk me through it.
 The part where you actually have a theory.
 Rude.
 Well, did she happen to whisper a safe word in her last breaths. A clue, maybe? Witchy path out of here?
 And that frown that's not upside down is telling me what?
 Still can't do magic.
 Perfect.
 I don't. How'd you sleep? Me... not good. My 1994 mattress was very lumpy. Whatcha got there?
 Yeah, well I found this. Drank it last year when Ric died. (He removes the CD that was playing.)
 For better, or for worse?
 You know, I am acutely aware that we are in some otherworldly time dimension. However, do you ever think for one second that maybe it's you being negative reacting to my natural self negative-ly?
 Nope, I'm consistent. Eat your pancakes. Oh, and (He grabs the newspaper from the counter and drops it in front of her.) you can do a crossword puzzle.
 You've got to be kidding me. Bonnie, look at the date on that paper.
 Well that proves it, we're in hell. Our own personal, custom-built hell. And you're in it with me. Bottoms up. (He drinks.)
 That joke got old six weeks ago.
 And failing. Further evidence, we're in hell. Not only am I stuck with you, I'm stuck with the useless version of you.
 Maybe it's the sound of existential despair. I hear that's what hell sounds like.
 Look who got 27 across. (He sounds impressed.)
 It's an old tongue twister Eddie turned top 40, Eddie Vedder, pearl jam. Yellow Ledbetter.
 Are you messing with me?
 Well, neither did I.
 I got it - (Damon said stubbornly.)
 Mmhmm.
 I know it's been awhile, but you couldn't do magic as an anchor, so I'm curious what momentary lapse reason makes you think you can do it now?
 First of all. Don't nickname, that's my thing (He points to himself and strolls over to Bonnie with the cart, he snatches another pair of glasses from her) And this proof -(Damon sets the blue glasses on his face, so now they both are wearing it.) This mysteriously filled in crossword, could very easily have been you.
 No. You don't know you filled it in. You also don't know that you talk in your sleep. Eggs.
 What am I doing?
 Not on the list and eww.
 It's gotta be a short, faulty wiring, something.
 You know i'm a little confused with all this misplaced hope. All right, Let's just say there's some one here. How do you know we're gonna get out?
 That's a hell of a logic knot you've tied for yourself.
 She wouldn't shut up. She just kept talking.I mean, it's a wonder I made it as long as I did, but here's the thing, I think it's better this way because she didn't have magic, and she was pretty much useless.
 What??
 That's my car. That's my car.
 Vrrrmm, vrrrmm!
 Shh, shh, shh, shh. This sound is the opposite sound of your voice, and I so enjoy it.
 I don't know, Bonnie. It was 18 years ago. Had a lot going on that day.
 Very unlikely.
 Someone may have put it here, Bonnie. Yes , i admit that.
 I know. (Elena puts her hand over Damon's)
 I'm gonna tell Elena how much I love her. And then I'm gonna apologize for killing you.
 I did that time. Let's go meet our little friend.
 No. It was in the front.
 Yes. Absolutely I'm sure. It was right there.
 It was a tarp. We saw a tarp.And that... that is on a timer. That turned on by itself.
 I left it here in '94.
 You filled it out, Bonnie. Which means we're alone in my own hell with no Grams escape hatch. We're never getting out.
 What?
 That is gonna have to stop.
 So you've been following us.
 No, I do not.
 This has been a monumentally bad day in a sea of bad days, so I'm gonna need to know who you are, what you're doing here, and how it relates to me, or I'm gonna rip your throat out.
 You think my temper's bad with her? I like her. You not so much. (Damon superspeeds and holds him up by his collar)
 Answers now.
 Thanks.
 Aah!
 I'm gonna rip your head off.
 Sorry I called you the most annoying person in the world. I hadn't met him yet. (Bonnie smiles)
 You're awake. Good. Now for the Q&A portion of the evening.
 What? No, no, no. These are for me. You just get the poker.
 No?
 How the hell should I know? (He takes a sip of his bourbon.)
 Bonnie...
 Okay. Fine. How is this pile of crap going to get us out of here?
 What difference does it make!?
 Or I could just torture you until you say something useful.
 Stop trying to impress the new guy.
 Maybe because I don't want to talk about the worst thing I ever did, Bonnie.
 Ready for some bad news?
 Barely seen you in fifty years, Stefan. You could invite a brother in.
 Check your answering machine, I'm trying to turn over a new leaf.
 Well—Stefan  It's a little late, but I see you're trying to make amends. I just want to know why.
 Uh, well, I can tell you this, Stefan—I'm tired of tearing up New York City. And, maybe it's the partying, or maybe it's my conscious—Stefan  Well, I believe that would require one.
  and then, I had this moment of clarity, and I said. "Wouldn't it be great if I just woke up in my own bed and could have a fresh start?"
 Why are you always expecting the worst out of me, Stefan?
 Huh. Thanks. (He brushes past Stefan after tapping his shoulder)
 Hell yeah.
 Remind me not to kill him.
 Whose side are you on?
 Fine.
 On May 9, 1994, I was living here. I'd come home to walk the straight and narrow.
 Can I have a sip of that? I'm starving.
 Whew. (He unscrews the cap and takes a swig.)
 Hmm-mm. (He's holding the blood in his mouth even though it's disgusting, his lips contorted.)
 Ugh  (He looks relieved to be done with it)
 How's it going, Zach? What's up with all the grocery trips?
 You know, maybe I should run the Salvatore boarding house. Take over for Zach, get in good with Gail...
 Perfect. Our savior's insane and narcoleptic.
 Shut up, Kai. You weren't listening.
 The only reason that you're alive right now is because I thought you could get us out of here and you could help us. But you don't HAVE any answers! You're just a man-child  (he picks up an empty jam can and tosses it angrily)  with jam on your fingers!
 Think you can find our ticket out of here, Bon-Bon? (He says her nickname comfortably, as if it's her true name)
 Maybe you're just out of practice and you suck at magic now.
 Easy there, big brother! She doesn't know you. At least buy her a drink.
 May I call you Liz?
 Your daughter is so adorable
 Ah, it works.
 Looks like the jig is up. Hey, look at me. Go home. Forget you ever met us.
 Yeah, in her coffee. I swapped it out last week. Same for Zach.
 And they'll trust us both! Look, no feeding inside the house, right? Snatch, eat, erase. It's all completely functional, Stefan. I told you, it's a new start!
 Thanks for the mind games, jackass.
 Well, one, because I knew you'd be mad. Believe it or not, I like being here, Stefan.
 OW! Ahhh!
 Because I missed my brother. I want to have a connection to my humanity, Stefan. I wanted to feel something again. And when I decided to come back home, it all came rushing back, just like I hoped it would.
 Come on, man. Let's just hit the road, you and me, huh? I'll let you drive my car, I'll get you off this vegan diet, teach you how to feed again. It'll be great, Stef. Huh? What do you say? Come on! Trust me.
 Way to be an optimist, Stefan.
 I'm not trying to screw up your dumb new life.
 Guess that's a no on the road trip, huh?
 You're wandering around like a crazy man, why?
 You're just not used to guys hitting on you.
 Can we just have a few lasting seconds of peace while this idiot uses that thing to get the stars to align?
 Hey, what's up with the nature walk?
 Great. Let's do some magic and get the hell out of here.
 What?
 What about it?
 Mmhmm.
 Something tells me you're not speaking hypothetically.
 You're making us jump through hoops, and you're a witch?
 I don't care! I wanna get out of here.
 This eclipse party blows. I didn't see the sun at all when I crossed the yard! I forgot how much stronger we are when we drink human blood.
 I want my ring back, Stefan. Atta boy.
 No, you're not. 'Cause in 1912, I showed you who you were, Stefan. In 1942, I gave you your freedom, and in 1977 I almost killed your best friend because it should have been you there to help me, Stefan. You owe me, and it'll take you an eternity to pay me back.
 An eternity of misery, brother. Just like I promised.
 Stefan compelled Uncle Zach to forget about the girlfriend and the baby. But, he couldn't cover up all those murders. Founder's Council was restarted, and Stefan took off. Left Mystic Falls for about fifteen years. We both did. And when I saw Uncle Zach again, I couldn't look at him without remembering that I ruined everything. So it was a nice relief when I got to kill him. Okay, can we go back now?
 Look, Bonnie, I know this guy's not a model citizen, okay, but I gotta get back. Not just for Elena, but for my brother.
 We may be having a bit of an disagreement, but don't ever lay a hand on her.
 Shame-eating?
 That's what you remember?
 'Cause I'm bored.
 Look, we can still get outta here, Bonnie. We can steal that "Descendant" contraption, find out what Kai knows and we'll ditch him, because he doesn't have any powers anyway.
 You gotta stop doing that. It's creepy.
 Okay, we get it!
 I smell an ultimatum.
 Because I have a hot date with my girl tonight.
 I'm thinking dinner and a movie, you know what? Screw the dinner and a movie. Skip straight to the good part.
 Whatever happened to hope, Bon? 'Member when I was all like boo, grr (Bonnie looks over to him) (Damon uses a high-pitched tone to mimic Bonnie) And you were like "hooray, hooray. We're getting out of here!"?
 Me, I say, because I will kill Kai and anyone (Damon does a playful jumping stance with the stick) who comes in the way of me going home.
 Where are you going?
 Ha.
 Zima, grunge, every Alex Rodriguez rookie card known to man, and a pager. Really?
 These are the important supplies you needed to get?
 Are we literally not going anywhere?
 Bonnie?
 Doesn't look like that from here.
 Hey! Bonnie.
 Whoa, hey, guys. STOP.
 NO! No! BONNIE!
 Great work, Bonnie.
 Mmm.
 Mmm, mm, MM.
 On the bright side, this stuff's not so bad. It's fruity, and fizzy.
 On the not-so-bright side, is your intelligence, because you took the only chance of us getting out of here and turned him into a giant... douche-kebab.
 Is that a trick question? Or is this stuff actually starting to kick in...
 This is the face I make when I don't understand you.
 Whoa, where are you going?
 Alright. Let's get awkward.
 Like this?
 I'm sure there are about a billion people you'd rather be here with...
 Okay, I got ya.
 Bonnie... get...out of here.
 No!
 NO!
 So what? Gone a couple of months, you think it's okay to waste a perfectly good bottle of bourbon?
 Ahh.
 Yep. In the flesh.
 Because I'm not dead, Stefan. I mean, this stuff's good, but it's not "I see dead people" good. Heh.
 Heh. It's a hell of a long story, brother, but... I'm back. I'm back.
 Yeah.
 I'm back, Stefan...
 I missed you too, buddy.
 Well, you didn't think I was gone gone! I promised you an eternity of misery. Heh. '
 She sacrificed herself so I could come back. But, I don't want anyone to know. No sense making this harder than it already is.
 I know. If a bunch of witches were going to get together and create some space-time purgatory, you'd think they'd pick a better year than the one Kurt Cobain killed himself in. The whole thing was just very depressing (He takes a swig from the bottle of bourbon).
 Long story, big flash of light, two decades worth of jet lag. I will explain all of my adventures in that flannel hellscape, but first, there's someone I got to go see (He heads toward the door, grasping Stefan's shoulders affectionately as he does so).
 She did what?
 I just need to see her, Stefan! Our eyes will meet, fireworks will go off, and the balance of nature will be restored. She loves me!
 I just wanted to talk
 Look. I know why you did what you did. It's not real. You know what's real? The way you felt for me. You once told me it was the most real thing you ever felt in your life.
 Oh, come on, Elena. You've compelled enough people to know it's just a way of covering the truth. And, no matter how badly you want it done, it doesn't make it any less of a lie, you know. Just open the door, Elena, please? Or, at the very least, step aside, because I'm gonna kick this door in. (She unlocks the door, and Damon hears it click. He turns the knob hopefully, and she stands there for a moment as though she's finally ready to see him. However, when he begins to open the door, she loses her nerve and vamp-speeds out the window. When he finally enters the room, Elena is gone, and he looks around the empty room and notes the curtains blowing in the breeze of the open window as he sighs).
 Professor Saltzman. What, you couldn't compel yourself a Ph.D?
 I am... heh. (He slides the glass to Alaric)
 Well let's see Ric... I clawed my way out of some retro-pocket-universe, only to find that I needed to compel myself a new change of clothes because this anti-magic hamster-ball is keeping me from going home. And then, I find out that my best friend, rather than doing anything about it, decided that it was the best use of his time to compel my beautiful and lovely girlfriend to forget that she ever loved me... Heh. I'm great, Ric. Thanks for asking.
 I know she was a train-wreck without me, but a full mind-erase? Seriously?
 Well, I'm flattered, but I'm back So, let's get this un-compulsion on the books, huh?
 Chicken, egg.
 Sorry? She won't even see me, Ric.
 It's not like I don't want Elena to be happy. I just want her to be happy with me. Right.
 Well, somebody was thorough. It's kind of creepy, you just standing there all hulk-y and brooding.
 Technically, I'm lying in wait.
 Because she wasn't there. It was just me.
 Sounds good. I'll give it a call.
 Bonnie wasn't there with me, Jeremy, because she found peace. She's in a better place.
 So, you didn't forget my number. That's a good start.
 And what is happening?
 Yeah! Yeah I'll be here  there, I'll be there, absolutely, in a bit. See you in a little bit.
 Well, that was fast 
 Who are you?
 Ugh!
 Ugh...
 Enzo? Well, this brings back memories.
 Stefan could've told me there was a hunter in town.
 Why would he do that?
 Yeah that'll do it.
 Ric. He's up to something. Better be something good, bastard owes me.
 I came back for this?
 No, no. Get him! (Stefan uses the crow bar to get Enzo loose from the chains that are attached to the top of the van. He then gets Damon loose. Tripp comes out of the front of his vehicle, blood gushing from his head. Instead of facing off with the vampires he tried to kill, he runs away. Damon, Stefan and Enzo struggle to get out of the van despite their injuries. In the grass, Alaric is gasping and panting as he spits up blood while Jo tries to help him medically)
 I was this close. This close.
 (takes a drink of his bourbon, clearly annoyed)Oh, I got it. Everybody's sorry. You're sorry you gave up on me. Sorry you turned Enzo into that hunter guy. Ric's sorry for the compulsion. I'm sure if Elena could remember anything. she'd be sorry too.
 I am so tired of hearing how hard it was for her. It was hard for me as well.
 Guess I still am. Ric said she's happy without me since she's erased me. You know what? I don't want her to be happy. I want her to be miserable, just like I am.
 Yeah. I'm done.
 What if it doesn't work? What if what we had isn't strong enough to break the compulsion?
 Here goes everything.
 Okay, I'll start. I know Alaric eternal sunshined our relationship out of your brain but please, please tell me it's coming back.
 Or at least part of it, because...imagining this exact moment is what got me through the last few months.
 Easy, so easy.
 Just say, that you missed me as much as I missed you.
 Maybe you just need a little more time.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, w-
 Yeah, um-I'm
 Yeah
 Keep going. We are on a roll. All the terrible things I did to people that Elena cared about. Let's see. I turned Caroline into my own personal blood juice box, I turned Matt's sister into a vampire and threatened to kill Bon-Bon a couple times.
 Subjective. Sometimes, I was being funny.
 Unfortunate coincidence.
 On second thought, let's focus on all the charming, heroic things you obliterated from my girl's mind.
 I know. And listen. Despite the fact that my long list of dastardly deeds involves killing you, I'm glad you're alive.
 Yeah.
 Although had you actually died a vampire instead of becoming human again, your compulsion would have gone away, and Elena would be mine again.
 Now she's stuck with only evil me memories forever and ever.
 Just a heads-up, doc. You're gonna be in real high demand with a bunch of vampires who want to be human again if you could repeat that little healing trick that you did at the border with Ric last night.
 She's bossy.
 I like her.
 Or she has a witchy advantage. What, supposed to be a secret that she's a witch?
 Oh, don't be cynical. I'm here to spend some quality time with my once dead, now human best bud.
 Who's that?
 Did I say I liked you? I meant the opposite.
 Hi. Damon Salvatore, Elena's ex. Nice to meet you...
 Liam.
 Damon.
 It's a figure of speech. It's more kind of an emotional death. You know, it was a very messy breakup, but we're past that now, right? We're... we're in the friend stage.
 Yeah.
 So the ex meets the new guy. Heh. How freaked out are you right now?
 Confident. Pfft. Sexy.
 Focus. Go the bar, get her a Chardonnay.
 I know.
 I'll explain on the dance floor. May I?
 Why? Well, because I'm an incredible dancer, and it would be a shame not to share my talent with the world. Oh. Don't worry. I didn't see you smile.
 Miss Mystic Falls. First time we ever danced. Stefan stood you up... Bloodlust issues, surprise, surprise... So I stepped in.
 I stepped in, sexy as hell, and saved you from complete and utter humiliation. Of course, you were just worried about Stefan, but there was this moment, this one moment, where everyone else fell away, and it was just the two of us.
 Come unannounced? What are you talking about? I literally went through time and space to be with you.
 I do, and no matter how much I missed you or how much pain I was in, I never would have erased everything we ever had. Even if I was drowning in grief, I'd rather hang on to every moment that I ever held you or every laugh that I ever heard, every shred of happiness that we ever had. I would rather spend every moment in agony than erase the memory of you.
 Well, you're a day late and a dollar short, honey?
 Yeah. How are you supposed to do that?
 Yeah. Sure. Tell me what you want me to do.
 Ok. What do you remember? How are you rewired?
 Yeah.
 There's just one little part of that story that you're missing. You got in the car with me.
 I was all ready to go, and the door opens, and you jump in the car and say, "we're in this together," and you weren't taking no for an answer. That was the moment I realized you were the perfect girl for me because you were just as crazy as I was.
 Ok. Happy. Well, there is a motel ice machine in Denver that's got some stories.
 Well, can't forget the night of your graduation.
 Shame. Probably one of your best speeches. You in your very passionate and adorable way told me you were in love with me, and hell if you were gonna apologize for it. My favorite memory of us, oh, one that I've relived a million times over the last 4 months is this summer night that we had before you went off to college. You wanted to show me this meteor shower, so we drove out in the middle of nowhere, and the moment those shooting stars started to fall, rain, lots of rain. You were so sure it would clear, and it was just easier to believe you, and I took your hand...
 Hey. Maybe you just need to try a little harder.
 What? What do you feel like?
 Hey. There are things you can't erase, and you know that. Hey.
 Sorry.
 Where are you going? Elena! Hey!
 Elena!
 Elena!
 Hey! What the hell are you doing? Ninety more seconds, you'd be dead. Hey.
 No, no, no, no. Hey. Listen. I would give anything for you to remember, but I'm not gonna risk your life. It's the last thing I would ever do... Even if you don't remember that. Let's get you home.
 When you became a vampire, part of me was thrilled because suddenly there was this possibility I could have you in my life forever, but then the other part of me was devastated because I realized you'd lost the life that you wanted to have.
 And since I've been gone, you've gotten part of that life back. You're thriving, you're happy. Yeah, sure. Maybe you'd be happy if we gave it another chance, but the truth is is... You're better off without me.
 I died. You started over. I need you to live your life. Be happy. I love you, Elena. Enough to let you go.
 It got cold and muddy. You were miserable, so we got in the car and... We drove home.
 One for you, one for me. Cheers, Horatio Fell.
 Come on. It's time to abandon ship.
 I promise.
 To optimism.
 Bonnie. You're still alive.
 Of course. Caroline demanded I bring string beans.
 Why? Were you not invited?
 Ooh, boy. You messed with the wrong girl's feelings. Heh heh.
 Why wouldn't I consult you in a decision that might permanently change your life? Hmm. I wonder.
 Ascendant.
 See what you did? Now we're pulling your weight. I really hope you figure this out before Christmas.
 Why don't you just date her, put us all out of our misery?
 Who would make a great girlfriend. Look. One, she's hot – objectively.
 Big plus. Three, very, very well organized.
 There are no drawbacks to this woman, Stefan.
 See? Another plus.
 Not unlike Caroline's feelings for Stefan.
 Oh, no. Is Stefan feeling sensitive about ruining his friendship with Caroline? She really liked him, and he broke her heart.
 I saw that from a mile away, and my brain's made of cotton.
 Ms. Cuddles, one – invisible creepy mansion, zero.
 He said without laughing.
 To keep Kai from using her to get out.
 It's all yours, brother.
 Hold, please. Rewind. That's Kai from planet 1994.
 Either that, or they both have a thing for Cosby sweaters.
 Met him? Watched him die, watched him come back to life. Why? You know him?
 Damon Salvatore.
 What's wrong with you guys?
 Ohh! No!
 Funny way of showing it, buddy.
 Ohh. Strangest months of my life. That whole repeating the same day thing, phew, disconcerting.
 Yeah he is, with my friend Bonnie, which leads me to why I'm here.
 Look. I'll tell you everything you want to know, but first, I need something from you. It's round, about yea big, a bunch of little gears and wheels and things. It's a lot harder to describe than I thought.
 Yeah. You know it. Where is it?
 Because I'll say please?
 So when you say merge, you don't actually mean merge, do you?
 Which is now moot thanks to Blond and Blonder, thank goodness. Look. Let's talk about this Ascendant.
 All right. I wasn't gonna say anything because you're his dad and all, but if he gets out, I'll just kill him. It's that simple.
 What the hell are you doing?
 You're just gonna take out Jo?
 Yeah. Hey. Anybody hear from Jo?
 All right. So let's just get this straight. We went to the airport, we took off all our clothes for security just so I can come out here, have my brain scrambled by papa Kai, who by the way can disappear into thin air... Poof... only to find Jo's rusty knife full of magic.
 Genius. Great. Then we go home. Shotgun. Come on.
 Girlfriend? You've been on, like, 3 dates.
 What? I'm just saying he barely knows her, and her literal evil twin is over there with Bonnie right now.
 OK. Get the Ascendant from Jo. Do whatever you got to do to get it, you understand?
 What? You got a better idea?
 Well, Ric had more frequent flyer miles, and Ric didn't deliberately forget our entire relationship.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.
 Bicker, mostly. Cooked, ate. We went through a Tetris phase, but I beat it, and she got mad. We talked. A lot. Apparently there are a lot of words in the English language, and Bonnie knows just about all of them.
 She sacrificed herself so I could come back. Hmm. Wow. Because when she wasn't talking, she was listening. She listened for hours and hours and hours, so when the opportunity presented itself for me to come back, she made sure I took it.
 What do you think?
 Dr. Future-Humanitarian-Award wasn't good enough? What went wrong?
 Well, Robert Frost, what's it gonna be?
 Sure.
 No. I compelled him to do whatever it takes, and considering the Ascendant is the key to her psycho brother's weird prison world, I'm sure it's gonna take her a few to open up about it.
 My relationship to ruin, thank you. I didn't complain when you ruined yours with Caroline.
 Yeah. I'm sure she's fine. She's on vacation with her mom, eating ice cream out of the carton, convincing herself she never liked you in the first place.
 Careful, Stefan. I know it may seem easy to be the big bad Salvatore, but soon, you'll find yourself lying in the middle of the road, pouring your heart out to a stranger, having an existential crisis.
 Assuming everything went well, it's already happened, which means...
 Thanks, buddy.
 There you go. Go home to Jo, be a good boyfriend, forget this ever happened.
 I don't know. It's Matt. Food, money, new social class. Whatever it is, it better distract Stefan from his sizeable screw-up with Caroline. Did you know about that, how she felt about him?
 Even if she compels away all the things she likes about him?
 Yep. Blood from a Bennett  Lucy to be exact  and an Ascendant from whatever the hell your last name is.
 Yup.
 Well, good old Jo  heh heh helping us out. Can we do this, please?
 What is that?
 Mmm. Bitter. Wonder why. Shall we?
 Hey.
 This is where your parents are buried.
 Yeah. So is Bonnie. So let's go get her. Just keep your eyes peeled. There's a pork rind-munching freak somewhere around here. Ok?
 Come on.
 Nothing. You?
 Look. Let's not jump to depressing conclusions yet, ok?
 And we're jumping.
 If Kai has Bonnie, we need to talk.
 I'm gonna page him actually.
 Sorry. Forgot you were two in 1994.Pagers are an ancient form of telecommunication.
 We dial jackass's number 555-HIYA-KAI...
 We leave our number... And then we hang up.
 And now we sit by the phone like a 13-year-old girl and wait.
 Whoa!
 Uh, it's my audition tape for "Real World  London." Fingers crossed. I think I'm finally gonna make it.
 What? No. Journals are lame, especially video ones.
 Well, I mean, because I was stuck here with Bonnie. What could be worse than that?
 Kai, if you so much as hurt one hair on her annoying little witch head, I will kill you and 
 Well, Muncie's about 6 1/2 hours away, give or take a knuckle.
 If you don't stop to use the little witches' room anymore 
 If he's got Bonnie's blood and the Ascendant, he's got everything he needs to get out. 
 Bon appetit.
 Nothing. Let's eat.
 6 letters, illiterate witch, B.
 Yep. Kai's greatest hits staring us in the face every day.
 Well, if I have my Gemini rules down, actually, he's going to merge with her, which will most likely result in her death, which I guess is 6 of 1 
 Um... Because I asked her very nicely? You want some music maybe? I'm gonna turn on some music.
 We have Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, Boyz II Men Stefan's.
 Fine. She didn't give it to me. Alaric stole it from her.
 After I compelled him.
 What? Elena, stop.
 Hey. I'm trying to get Bonnie back!
 May 10, 1994, I had a day. I was mad at Stefan for something. I don't even remember what it was, and in typical Damon fashion, I acted out. People died. A lot of them, and believe it or not, ever since that day, I've felt horribly guilty. So I thought that this was my hell, Elena... But you know who didn't? Bonnie. She had hope for both of us. She's the reason I survived, the reason I made it out. Who knew? Turns out you spend time with someone and don't kill them, you actually become friends. I'm doing this for Bonnie, Elena, not for you. And that's it.
 Pfft. Don't make this any weirder than it needs to be.
 If she's not lost. She has a terrible sense of direction.
 It did. I fixed it. Bonnie and I came here every day. It was the closest thing I had to a picture of you, and I needed every reminder I could get.
 You want to go inside?
 We'll make new ones.
 Oh, no.
 Elena, you're over the border.
 Until the next comet, or full moon, or eclipse. As long as we have that, we can go back as many times as we need until we get her back.
 I am gonna enjoy the hell out of this.
 You ok?
 Look, Ric.
 We had to get Bonnie back.
 Yeah, I know.
 He's out, but it's not our fa 
 I left Bonnie a note at the house. I told her we would be on your front porch.
 She'd probably be there now with about a half an hour to spare.
 She sacrificed everything for us over and over again, and then we were supposed to be there for her.
 She's all alone.
 Are you watching me sleep?
 I don't drool.
 Hmm. Ohh. What time is it?
 Well, we haven't looked hard enough. Let's get to it.
 Find anything yet?
 Still staring.
 She'd do it for us.
 Why?
 Not to give you boyfriend lessons or anything, but if you knew Jo's whackjob brother was out on the loose and after her, don't you think that keeping an eye on her would have been a smart move?
 Plan's easy. Find Kai, fftt, kill Kai. Mmhmm.
 Just think sociopathic Ryan Reynolds.
 Grunge vibe, annoying as hell.
 Well, if he has half a brain, he will be hiding where vampires can't find him. So in between levels of Mario Kart, can you and little baby Gilbert maybe keep an eye out?
 Well, Bevis and Butthead are on the lookout. Anyone else brimming with confidence?
 What could possibly not make sense about magical twins absorbing into one another?
 Jo doesn't have magic because it's stuffed in a knife that was stolen and hidden by yours truly. Kai won't find it.
 It's impossible.
 Kai finds it. Great. Love it.
 Because if Kai goes for the knife, I will kill him because the knife is right here where I hid it. Tada!
 Bet you think you're pretty clever, don't you?
 Well, you weren't in your dorm room, and your pouty little goth friend wasn't in hers.
 Let me guess. You 3 idiots figured that Kai merging with Jo benefits you and Liv. Now I'm not sure exactly how Luke fits into that yet, but I'll use my imagination.
 We both knew that wasn't gonna work. Where's Jo?
 Is that what you people think of me, that I just instantly resort to violence? I just have a question. I mean, look. I get why you don't want to merge with Liv, ok, because no one wants to see that face with her hair. I get it, but what makes you think Kai merging with Jo is any smarter? I mean, I heard he killed 4 of your siblings, and that was without magic. Eh, it'll be fine. I'm sure when Kai gets all that power he's just gonna mellow right on out. Heh.
 That's it? We're gonna kill bad guys together, and you're not gonna talk to me?
 All right. Look. I agree that maybe compelling you to betray your lady friend was an irrational decision stemming from untreated control issues.
 What?
 I'm sorry, Ric.
 Yeah.
 Cemetery, really?
 Thank you. Kill him.
 She's lightheaded and confused. I'll give her some of my blood, ok? Kill him.
 Who cares? Kill him.
 We're moved truly. Kill him now.
 Ric.
 How's this? I kill you, and when you're in hell, you can ask a bar full of dead travelers, who cast the damn spell.
 I'm working on my knuckleball.
 Can I ask why we continuously compromise logic for some girl you just met?
 Bonnie's stuck over there because of him. She's over there, and I'm over here, and I hate myself for it.
 You should probably go change that tire.
 Hey. Where are you? I can't hear you.
 Hey. Elena!
 He stopped talking. He never stops talking.
 What happened to his chains?
 You little magic sucker. Sucked up all that magic from the traveler spell.
 Gah! I really, really hate that move.
 Ric! Hey. Come on. Take my damn hand, Ric. Come on.
 Ahh. Just walked through the front door, which I should probably start locking now that Kai's supercharged and on the prowl.
 I'm listening.
 Come over. I'll cook you dinner, and we'll talk about our crappy days.
 That's not possible.
 What? This was gone. I blew this up.
 Ha!
 Ha ha ha! Thank you.
 Deal. Deal. Ha! Yeah.
 Well, we're home.
 You sticking around?
 Hello. Anybody there?
 Well, you clearly underestimate the number of women who'd die to spend a night with me.
 Oh, I got words. Plural. I got, "Something came up at the dorm, had to bail, can we raincheck?" and an emoticon of a cold shower.
 Well, baby steps. Step one  allow him to turn my house into Hogwarts. Step two  call in a favor from the Sheriff. Ask her to put out an APB on a super-charged serial killer named Kai Parker.
 What the hell is he doing?
 So you can literally smother her?
 Well, I think that would require you having my support, Caroline.
 For 170-odd years, I've never known an instance where our blood cured cancer. But hey, sheriff, if you want to be a guinea pig in an experimental study involving weird, unpredictable magic...Far be it from me to stop you.
 See? Ahh, mommy knows best. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to make sure those witches aren't destroying my house. Feel better. (winks at Liz)
 Magic camp. How may I help you?
 Whoa. Elena?
 Cry me a river. Just do this stupid cloaking spell so I can go grab Elena and you can get back to wrecking my mansion.
 What are you doing? The back door's right here.
 What?
 Whatever. Hope you cloak better than you teach. 'Cause from the looks of my living room, Jo's not learning very much.
 Liv? Liv? Hey! Liv!
 What the hell are you doing here?
 No!
 So, Liv's gone. I need a Plan B.
 Her wonder twin took her and I can't just go blazing in there; Kai will kill Elena to spite me. I need a witch.
 Let me guess, Jeremy's holding a crossbow.
 Anyone have any other ideas?
 I can hear Kai yammering.
 He said it's a shame you don't have vamp-hearing.
 It's not awkward, it's annoying.
 Yes. At the expense of logic and reason.
 Shh.
 Hey.
 Jo's invisibility spell. If you can see us, that means you joined the party.
 What?
 Good call. Boiler room. Stat. Come on.
 You good?
 Woah. Why is your nose bleeding?
 Don't sweat it. I want him to see me while I kick his ass. Now, get out of here, okay?
 Where's Elena?
 Okay, okay. (Elena gasps in pain as Damon pulls out a last splinter)
 What? What's wrong? Didn't I get it? What?
 What? No. No, no, no, no. Hey, look at me. I'll get it.
 What? I'll find it, Elena.
 Come on. No. Seriously?
 Perfect timing.
 Ooh, you know, I don't know. I mean, every time we try and go on a date, we get kidnapped, I get sent to a prison world, or your feelings get compelled away. I just I don't know if it's gonna 
 Well, I guess we'll find out tomorrow.
 Jo's not strong enough, Ric.
 No, no, no. I don't think she's lying about it. He absorbed a spell the size of Mystic Falls, Ric. He changed the game.
 What if she can't?
 Well, all right then. Here's to women who make crazy, screwed up decisions and loving them more for it. (they cheers, take a drink)
 Hey.
 Sandwich?
 Ok. Ooh. That's new. (motions to Elena's ring)
 Depends. Does it work?
 Yeah, inside in the shade.
 Speaking of killing people. Still counting sheep or whatever the hell you psychopaths dream of?
 Fine.
 You're so cute when you're all doctorly. Ohh. Hey. You forgot this. You're not free tonight by any chance, are you? Because I know this little Italian joint that has eggplant so good you actually think you're eating people.
 Perfect.
 And I'm thinking maybe after that, go the Arthouse Theater. They're playing some pretentious French flick.
 Well, not to see the movie, silly. To hide in the back and throw popcorn at the hipsters.
 Cheating? Cheating is erasing all of our epic memories. That's cheating.
 I understand. Where would you like to start?
 Fine.
 Great.
 Good.
 Bye (door slams; Damon waves)
 Well, I'm no doctor but that guy is screwed.
 Hey, no offense, but could someone tell me why I was called down here to listen to the story of Colin the Cancer Vamp?
 Please, sound less confident, Doc.
 Well, then you're uniquely qualified. Witch-doctor and all.
 Hey, the blood transfusions are stopping the cancer from eating her alive? Or hey, is there a sheriff-sized space available in the family crypt?
 I don't know if you remember this, but Liz and I are pretty close.
 I mean, as far as humans go, she's...tolerable.
 Yeah.
 He made a wish, I granted it.
 The blood transfusion didn't work. So you didn't just kill him, Blondie.
 Bad timing, Lockwood. I'm in a mood. What the hell are you doing?
 I'll make it easier on you. I'll give you multiple choice  A) I'm being an idiot. B) I have anger issues and I'm a puny human now and I have to pick on people while they sleep. C) A and B are both correct.
 Really?
 Oh, so you just thought you'd come and grab Kai as a failsafe in case Papa Parker says no to Liv and Luke. You just turn him loose and he merges with Jo anyway, huh? While I appreciate your efforts, he's a psycho freak magic siphon. I'm not gonna just let you walk out with him. I could kiss you right now, you beautiful moron.
 Yep, that stuff works really well. Nighty-night. That should keep you down for an hour.
 Well, I'm sorry to hear that Twinderella. Big pitch going south, is it?
 Well, the good news is, your boyfriend and I, I think, have come up with a solution. Now it's a bit of a Hail Mary, but I think everybody gets what they need. I just have to ask Papa Parker one question, so do you mind putting him on?
 He's, uh, out at the moment.
 Hello, sir. Damon Salvatore here. We had Thanksgiving together. Anyway, I've been sitting here Googling celestial events happening today and I was just curious  Would a Mercury-Venus conjunction give you enough juice to do a little Gemini merge party?
 I'm gonna take that evasive answer as a yes. So, here's the situation  I'm gonna need you to use that planet party to merge your set of blonde twins ASAP. Because, well, unfortunately, your formerly comatose son is gonna be on the loose and Hell-bent on beating you to the punch.
 Rise and shine, you little weasel.
 Oohh, trying to pop a blood vessel in my brain? Sorry. Not gonna work. Looks like all that magic you sucked up drained away while you were asleep, which is good for me. Don't worry, I know where you can get more.
 No. And I'm not gonna trust you. I just happen to need a magic siphon and you're the only game in town.
 What she said. So do your stupid little magic-suction trick and suck the magic out of her. Right now.
 Is it working?
 Yeah.
 Hey, shh. Listen. You told me Liz was gonna die in eight hours if the magic kept doing it's thing. He steals magic. You made it through med school, I figured you knew where I was going with this.
 He wants to merge. Tonight.
 You almost burned my house down. Don't you think I know that? Luckily for you, it's all be taken care of.
 Elena, hey. What happened?
 Okay, no offense Elena, but I think we need to get a real doctor.
 What's the mean? Dead?
 Uh-uh. Hey, I compelled you to save her. Unless you want me to gouge your eyes out, I suggest you keep working. Here.
 Get out of here. Forget you're a total failure.
 Hey, she's gone.
 Where you going?
 I thought you wanted to start over. Because, FYI, this is exactly where we left off.
 Good. You're still alive. That's gonna save me a huge blowout with Ric when he gets back. I am definitely coming into something late.
 Huh. So I guess adding the words 'twin merge' to my vocabulary was pointless, 'cause they ain't twins.
 Well, uh, let me give him some of my blood.
 (looks at the cupcakes and
 Hi.
 I think Caroline might fry us

 Was this the talk?

 You mean the year that his parents died?
 Extracurricular activities, health and fitness, that sort of thing. I mean, did you see how scrawny he used to be?
 Funny thing about that, he actually didn't fake it. We went to this island off the coast of Canada in search of this cure for vampirism, and Jeremy...
 Yeah.
 So can we try this my way now?
 He will. He just won't earn it. Ok. Um... This small-town atmosphere doesn't nurture a creative spirit like Jeremy Gilbert, and it's of your opinion that it's high time for him to get the hell out of Mystic Falls.
 Oh! Look who graduated. Oh! Ha!
 Sure. I mean, practically flunking, missed 100 days of school, and you can barely spell the word "cat," but sure. He was fine with you graduating early.
 She will be. We all will. Somehow, we'll all find a way to move on without you, Jeremy. Oh, hey, just did. Oh, look under the cap. I jacked a little going-away present from Ric's girlfriend's stash. Put it away, you idiot. Tell your sister, I'll kill you... again.
 Not to be blunt, but I think dying gets you a ticket out of work. Just saying. How you feeling?
 Well, let me see if I can help you close a couple of them. Uhh! Yeah. This one was me. Me. Also me. Ooh, this one was Stefan's. Oh, wait. No. Me. Yeah.
 Elena's parents. Didn't know there was an open investigation.
 What, that I was involved? Liz, no. No, I promise you.
 I'll be damned. Looks like you got a good, old-fashioned, sheriffy whodunit on your hands.
 Right. You know, this would be a lot more fun if I had some...
 Well, look at that. This is why you are a terrible sheriff.
 Ah, suit yourself.
 Yeah. Stefan, always a one-upper.
 Well, believe it or not, Liz, I once had a mommy, too. She died around that day. In the years that my emotions were "on," I would stop by and leave flowers at her grave.
 Not much to say. She died, old-timey disease... Consumption.
 Tell you what. Why don't we use your investigative instincts to solve this? Come here. Check this out. All right. So why were the Gilberts taking Wickery bridge when old Miller road was clearly 10 minutes faster, and why are there no skid marks at the scene of the accident, and why was the trunk full of luggage as if they were going out of town?
 What about the voicemail?
 Wait. You cook?
 Hey... Oh... You ok?
 Yeah?
 Ok.
 That makes sense. Yeah. I'll let her know. So the message was a joke. Miranda wanted you to bust Jeremy for smoking pot.
 There was a storm the day before. Jeremy's dad was planning a secret trip to their lake house, and the storm rained them out.
 Slick roads, no skid marks.
 Absolutely. I'll go get the car.
 Ok. Get in there. Ohh... Nice PJs situation. You look hot.
 You wanted more today, didn't you, about the accident?
 No. You wanted someone to blame.
 I know. Sometimes really terrible things happen to amazing people. 
 Yeah. She will. You tell her yourself. Come on. Lay down on this bed.
 For what?
 You know, I didn't get a chance to spend much time with my mom before she died. I volunteered to write the eulogy, and then when she actually died, I didn't even go to the funeral.
 Hmm?
 No promises.
 Yeah? I'll be right back. Want rocks, or you want neat? Liz?
 Caroline.
 She fell asleep. 
 Oh, she's stable, but, you know.
 Not long. The hospital says she has a DNR, so... 
 Help yourself.
 You believe your mother entrusted me to eulogize her?
 I think she's trying to teach me a lesson about my own mom. Was supposed to do the eulogy at her funeral, and I just-
 Right.
 None taken.
 Hey, blondie. Today isn't the worst day of your life. Today and tomorrow, it's a cakewalk. And there will be people day in and day out like they're afraid to leave you alone. The worst day? That's next week when there's nothing but quiet. Just a heads-up.
 Sure. Anytime.
 What are you doing?
 He will skin you alive. Take mine. Okay.
 Not quite.
 I will finish it, Stefan.
 That is because father is incapable of human emotion. You are ten. You can cry if you feel like it.
 Why's that?
 When was this?
 I must have missed it. There. Be on your way. (Pats Stefan on the head, who leaves the room.
 It's percolating.
 Oh, this sounds promising.
 Ooh! Finally!
 Oh. Pull the ripcord.
 Well, she's not the one. If she was, you wouldn't have to ask.
 You've been in love twice in your life, Stefan. Setting aside that it was technically the same face, does this feel like that? Not all love is true love, brother. Caroline wants the real deal, and if you don't, pull the ripcord before you make things worse. Just not today. Let her have today.
 No, I'm not done, and I will never be done. I am not a nice person and should not have to stand in front of the whole town and pretend to be a nice person. This is Liz having a last laugh from the great beyond.
 Not helping.
 I know.
 I did not know what to say.
 Liz Forbes was my friend. In her last moments, she asked me to pass along a message to her daughter, but I cut her off before she could say too much. I told her she could tell Caroline herself, but she didn't get that chance. Your mom wanted you to know how proud of you she was, and she should be. You're a beautiful, strong woman, a generous friend, and a bright light in a sea of dark. She said you were extraordinary, and you are, and so was she. Liz was a hero to this town. She was a hero to all of you. And she was a hero to me. Goodbye, Sheriff. You will be missed.
 Thanks.
 I just needed to be reminded that the goodbye wasn't about me. I failed you by not doing the eulogy at our mother's funeral. I didn't want to fail anyone today.
 Well then, brother, stop wasting your time sitting here with me. I think she could use a piece of news like that today.
 Where'd you go, Elena? Call me back.
 Bonnie?
 Oh, you made it!
 I don't get it. So you were in my house in a 1903 prison world.
 Congratulations. You shot some walls.
 Who is this?
 Oh, my God.
 That's my mother.
 
 
 
 I don't know. A ghost? Maybe she has an evil Gemini twin.
 If my mother was imprisoned in 1903, she'd be in her 70's.
 
 
 Well, even if she does... 
 Not your fault, Stefan. By the time you figured out how you felt about her, it was too late. She made her choice.
 Will do, brother. 
 I'll tell him as soon as I know the truth.
 Which is why you're still here. Your sister sent me and Elena back to 1994. You can send me back to 1903.
 Oh. As the newly elected president of the Gemini freaks, I assume you know where to get it. 
 
 Uh-Oh! Caroline go off the rails? If so, I called it.
 
 You don't have to pretend, Bon. I'm like a fever you can't shake.
 
 Oh, you mean the one where my brother was an auto mechanic, and my girlfriend forgot she loved me? Yep.
 So... Teensy favor. I don't know if you know this, but when Kai merged with Luke, he went through a... metamorphosis. He went from a sociopathic caterpillar to a slightly less evil butterfly.
 
 Don't worry about it. I'll figure it out on my own. Happy raving!
 Bonnie. She doesn't want to do it. 
 
 What are you talking about?
 
 
 Hey.
 Don't freak out, but, um...
 
 
 Hey. Calm down. It's just me. He's not here. Bonnie, this is about my mom. Kai knows a lot of stuff about my mom 
 I know but Bonnie 
 He just wanted to talk 
 I get that he hurt you...
 Ugh!
 Ow!
 
 Aagh!
 
 I'm not in the mood for the preamble  just tell me why my mom's stuck in 1903.
 That's odd. 
 
 
 And I'm telling you, as a vampire who eats people, you really don't want to piss me off.
 Tell me how to get her back!
 
 
 
 Anything I should know, or anything you'd like to talk about, bro-to-bro?
 Pardon?
 Not a good time for a humanity flip, brother.
 Looking for a... healthy outlet for my rage. I haven't found it yet. Stefan without his humanity is one artery away from Stefan the Ripper, and every day that goes by is one year of guilt waiting for him on the other side.
 Well, take it away from me. Because I'm seconds away from using it on this.
 This... is Lillian Salvatore.
 Yep. Turns out she's been in a prison world snapshot of 1903 for over a century.
 Oh, yeah. Alive and well. Not in the pine box that I thought I buried her in in 1858. And apparently, she's a vampire and not just any kind of vampire either-
 She's a Ripper, Elena. Makes perfect sense. Stefan was always such a mama's boy.
 He would have hanged himself with mother's apron strings if it meant her approval. We both would. We loved her. She was our world.
 What? No. No way.
 Elena, this woman killed so many people that an entire coven of witches built her a permanent timeout! You don't fix one Ripper problem by unleashing another Ripper.
 I might know a few witches that could help.
 Ow.
 Yeah, and then I real-apologized for being a dick.
 Bonnie, we need Kai to get to 1903, and we need Bennett blood to do the damn spell. Listen. We go in, we grab my mom, she flips Stefan's switch, he triggers Caroline, emotional dominoes, heyy! Everybody wins.
 Probably, although I think you're gonna want to join us. Stick with me, Bonnie Bennett. I might just have the answer to all your prayers.
 Whoa. Who said you're coming?
 Fine. Let's go get Mama.
 Well, isn't this a picturesque slice of hell?
 Page 10 on the world-jumping rule-book. Shall we?
 Aww, thanks! We're not here to socialize. We get the Ascendant, we find my mother, and after she flips Stefan's switch, we figure out what the hell we're going to do with her.
 Chance to what? Disarray another literal boatload of people?
 And where was Lily from 1858 to 1903? She was blood-binge-ing through Europe while Stefan and I carried the loss. Not exactly maternal, Elena. Far as I'm concerned, my mother died when we buried her empty coffin. What we're looking for is just a tool to get my brother back.
 Hello, mother.
 My bad.
 And you never thought to stop by and clear things up?
 Mrs. Salvatore?
 It's called "prison." You must have pissed off a lot of people.
 You on a diet?
 Mmhmm.
 He was! And then, Stefan ripped his throat out.
 Oh, I know you did. So much so that you left your kids with him, faked your own death, and then went out to join the Ripper Coalition.
 So, you're gonna be an angel again. He doesn't need to how how screwed-up you really are.
 Pack your bags.
 You'll alert who, now?
 What traveling companions?
 These... poor souls... don't happen to have the same affinity for rolling heads, do they?
 Not only is she a Ripper  She's an insane Ripper!
 What, are you kidding me? Vampire dollhouse?
 Yeah.
 Because Bonnie isn't looking for the Ascendant, Elena.
 Your vampire-menagerie is going to have to take the next train out. We're down a witch.
 We'll come back for them. Promise. Let's go.
 Go. Start the damn spell. I'll go get her.
 I said, they're not coming.
 We'll see them after the reunion. Let's go.
 Too bad.
 Do you understand me?
 Whole world runs on those things. The sooner you learn 'em, the better.
 That's more Stefan's thing. But, he can give you a tutorial after you mother him back to sanity.
 I'll let you get some sleep.
 Yes?
 Oh.
 Soon! But, don't worry  your prison world's not going anywhere.
 You better check the inventory of the blood cooler before Lily wakes up.
 You brought that back?
 Give me that!
 Disappointed and disillusioned? You see that every day.
 She's just a means to get Stefan back.
 You're lucky you're so adorable, because your eternal optimism is super annoying.
 This woman left her kids to go be the den mother to a family of vampires  I think we're going to be looking for quite a while.
 Oh hey, Bon-Bon.
 This better be good.
 You know there's a crazy-lady up there who wants to open that prison world up more than anything, right?
 No! We're not!
 Well, I 
 That's not what I think it is... is it?
 The cure. The cure to vampirism.
 Why are you giving me this?
 What if I don't want it for her now?
 
 Yeah, or some baby she abducted from a nearby village.
 No, she is a tool to get Stefan's humanity back, because there is no doubt that he and Caroline are fangs-deep in bodies right now. So, the sooner we get our supernatural-born killers out of circulation, the better.
 
 
 
 The Ascendant.
 
 We'll have to do some digging, yeah. Be patient, they take time. They're very rare.
 
 And videos of cats riding robot vacuum cleaners.
 
 
 Here. Text Elena. Tell her we're headed to campus to check it out. 
 Mmhmm.
 No, no, no, no  short and sweet. Just "Headed to campus." 
 Exactly.
 Sure. I know how terribly concerned you are about that.
 Knock yourself out.
 Not that that's any of your business, but yes, I do. And she loves me. We're in the love.
 You spied on me?
 
 
 I don't even know if she wants the cure.
 Yeah? Well, we have to start somewhere. Elena said she treated some kid who was attacked coming out of modern European history. 
 
 You'll be fine. 
 Yeah. 1903. You found out we were vampires, you landed in New York Harbor after a forty-year romp in Europe, and you...
 Oh. You weren't coming to get us.
 You can do this. All we have to do is just try.
 Well, she was her overly-proper self, but yeah  that was the gist of it. But, hey, you know, I'm not planning on honoring my end of the plan by jail-breaking her friends, so... Tch, figure we're even.
 Nah, it's fine. 150 years is a long time to care.
 
 
 Stefan's also not a moron.
 Where the hell are you going?
 
 You won't fail.
 
 Why would I lie?
 
 Come on. Get him out of here. Here, take my car.
 
 
 
 On the list of things to be worrying about, she's not one of them. 
 Well, Matt lives to hate vampires another day, Stefan's on Caroline-duty, and I just introduced Mom to Uber. Taking bets on which one goes south first!
 
 Why not?
 ...Jealous?
 What if things could be different? What if you could change everything?
 
 This better be important.
 
 Tell me.
 
 Ah, look at that! Saint Stefan has a plan. Let me guess  whoever's holding the kitten gets to talk about their feelings?
 Sold!
 See? He'll be convincing.
 Oh, she'll want to see him.
 I mean, it's a bit of a tricky bet for you, isn't it, brother? She's gonna expect a lot.
 Do it? Yep!
 Okay. Sore subject. Understood. So, what do we do once you earn her trust?
 What is that?
 Sure. Unless she wants sexy-Stefan-time instead of an assault on Memory Lane.
 Towels!
 Sure you want to do this?
 Hello.
 Well, you know, I was just in the hood. I thought I might stop by and bring my friend a little morning pick-me-up.
 Uh, it's a mocha-latte-frappi-somethin'. I dont know  I guessed.
 Please don't tell me you said anything.
 Well, yeah. Look. I've been busy, you know? My mom's in town. I had to vampire-proof a B & B. Do you have any idea how many people I had to compel to make that happen?
 You ever hear of April Lyrids? Yeah, me neither. Anyway, it's a stupid comet that my mom thinks she's gonna use to pull her friends out of the 1903 prison world.
 Well, I may have reinforced that possibility... when I gave the Ascendant to her for safe-keepings.
 Come here.
 I think the PC term is "witchpire."
 But it doesn't matter, because she still needs you to do the spell to open up the door to 1903, Bonnie!
 So we stall her! Look, Lily's like a bill collector. You dodge her calls long enough, she'll leave you alone.
 Look. The fact that you suck at torturing people is nothing to be ashamed of. That's why you have me!
 They have a list?
 Do you have a list?
 I thought you liked this place?
 Well, excuse me, missy. I guess we've never played the "Let's-Pretend-We're-Human" fantasy game together. All right. Let's play. You're human. Five years from now, where are you?
 Boring. I'll need a zip code.
 You made me Matt Donovan in your fantasy?
 Of course you are. Kids?
 Hmm...You got it all figured out, don't you?
 Um.
 Sounds like the rats are restless.
 Bored yet?
 Brought you some real light reading from the "True Crime" section.
 Curious... Which one of you idiots attacked a stadium security guard and stuffed him in a laundry cart?
 Nice technique. Although, it's probably good that your mom's gone because that would have been a hell of a cover up.
 Because Stefan didn't snap a bar-back's clavicle in half. You know, it's really quite sad actually. I can see Liz right now  (Caroline rolls her eyes)  Calling the parents, breaking the news, wondering where she went wrong as a mother...
 Oh! Blame her. Healthy attitude, Caroline.
 You're a real bitch when you're hungry.
 Elena.
 But you do want to be human.
 Exactly. It wouldn't work. Human-you chose Stefan.
 Just admit what you really want, Elena.
 Oh, good. Mommy Dearest.
 What are you...My mother?
 Is what with me?
 Maybe you misplaced it.
 Well, I don't have it, so start pulling up pillow cushions.
 It's really not a priority on my list of problems right now, Mother.
 You wouldn't do that.
 You don't know what you're doing, Bonnie.
  Look. I'm all about girl power, but just give me the damn Ascendant, and I promise you, Kai will not get out.
 My mom has the cure, Bonnie.
 If I don't bring her that, she's gonna destroy it.
 Stop! (He vamp-speeds toward her, putting her in a choke hold, but she uses her magical strength to throw him off her before she magically puts the fire out. They both gasp for breath as Bonnie points at the Ascendant on the floor)
 You don't want to push me, Bon-Bon.
 I can't, because I don't.
 Oh, it will just be like old times. I screw up, and you punish me for it.
 Elena, I can explain.
 Not so subtle in hindsight, was it?
 That makes two of us. My mother threatened to destroy that today... And I didn't stop her.
 Because your fantasy of five-years-from-now scared the hell out of me. I panicked.
 All I see in five years from now is you. You see your entire future, and I want you to have that. I want you to live in a big city and be a surgeon and have a family.
 Because I'm an idiot and I'm selfish and I'm so in love with you and I don't want to lose you.
 ...Already tried to pawn it off.
 You're gonna take the cure, Elena.
 You're gonna take the cure, Elena, and I'm gonna take it with you.
 I don't want to face my future without you. I'll become human, too.
 I just... I was standing there, and it just sort of came out.
 It's easy  Elena guzzles it, goes back to her human self, I feed on her, and as long as no one sucks it out of me, then we grow old and die of the common cold.
 
 
 I want to be with Elena.
 
 
 Hmmm  to you.
 Where are you? And please tell me you're with a stripper.
 
 
 And here we thought she didn't have a maternal bone in her body.
 
 Nope! Just love to Mom. Heh. Kidding.
 
 
 
 
 
 Is that why you're walking around town, eating french fries? 
 Oh, I'm just clearing my head. Asked a girl a really big question last night. She just sort of left me hanging.
 That's all right. She's probably just doing some soul-searching.
 
 Soak it in while you can! And, load up on fries, because trans fat is no friend to humans.
 Honestly? A little of both.
 
 To be continued. I want to show you something.
 Well, down, for starters. Unless you want to wuss out and take the stairs?
 
 What's your favorite thing about being a vampire?
 
 I like all of it. The speed, the feed, everything so heightened... And, eternally looking great in a black leather jacket's not the worst thing. I'm forgetting something, though...
 Hmmm. Oh, I remember! Getting in people's heads is quite a bit of fun, too.
 You won't remember this, but this is the first place I ever kissed you. Another very happy memory Ric scrubbed from your brain.
 Isn't that the point? I mean, as epic as this life is, we'd be giving up so much more if we didn't do this. I've had so much fantasy in my life, Elena. Enough for 100 lifetimes. I'd give it all up for one life with you.
 
 I know you do. You've wanted this since the day you became a vampire.
 
 And madly in love with you forever! No matter how long that's gonna be. And taking this cure, Elena, won't change that. I'm ready for a little reality if you are.
 'Til dead do us part. 
 How do you feel?
 So, what looks good 
 Sorry. You first!
 
 
 I was thinking five-year-anniversary.
 Hang on! I'm gonna get you home. You're gonna be alright.
 
 What happened?
 
 
 
 Hang on. It's Stefan. 
 
 
 
 
 What do you think?
 I want to be with Elena, Stefan.
 Ugh, of course I know what it feels like. Why do you think I didn't tell you? Can we go find our mother?
 You okay?
 Good news from the front lines  Bonnie is okay, Jo is okay, and Lily has been laid down for a long winter's nap.
 
 That's a good thing, right?
 
 
 
 Hey! That was a long time ago.
 
 
 I don't care what Stefan thinks! I've made up my mind. I'm not gonna have him drown me in a fountain of guilt and have me change my mind.
 "Sure. I'll be your best man, Ric. But first, hang out with the worst man so that my brother can kidnap me on the day of your wedding."
 I hate little Stefan mind-games even more.
 So, anytime you want to clue me in as to where the hell we're going...
 Is Mr. Rogers expecting us?
 Yeah, you're gonna be joining him in make-believe if you don't get to the damn point.
 You don't think I thought this through?
 Yeah, It's nice. Brazilian hardwoods, open floor plan, updated kitchen. What kind of road-kill are you cooking in there?
 Oh yeah? What's this?
 Paperwork? That's your big move?
 Every idiot in the country does it. You think I'm gonna have trouble with this?
 Maybe. Then I would just come home and pop a beer from my beautiful stainless steel refrigerator.
 Well, that's not very brotherly of you.
 Well, that is where your are wrong, my brother. This will not be my life.
 This will be my life. See, Elena was pretty explicit about what she wanted. Now this isn't TriBeca. New York's a little too crowded for me, but it is above the bar that I own, next to a medical school. It's in the northwest somewhere. I mean, I'd tell you where it was, but you made it abundantly clear you didn't want to know. Heh, heh. I'm gonna check out upstairs.
 Well, I applaud you for your effort, Stefan, but I think it's time for the "This Is Your Life" tour to end. You get the address?
 Good.
 Ugh, what now? You gonna give me a lecture on laundry, oil changes, personal hygiene?
 What about them?
 You know, I'm not very big on labels, bro, but I think we're pretty good on that front.
 Watch it, Stefan.
 Not gonna happen.
 Rough night?
 Come sit, have a drink with me.
 Oh god! Elena has a job. Somebody help me.
 Hello.
 I sense judgment, which is odd. You're the one who wanted me to own a bar.
 Yeah, well that bar's a lot more affectionate then you.
 Well, I'm drinking my butt off building mine.
 And do what?
 Well, that's the thing, Elena. I can't do what I want to do because what I want to do is drink all night without getting drunk, drive my car like a psycho without fear of death. I want to tear someone's head off without getting arrested.
 Because of you. I can't because of you.
 This was a damn mistake.
 Get out of my head!
 I see what you're doing. This isn't about me being alone. This is about you being alone  without me, without Elena. Awfully selfish of you, brother.
 So you make us drift apart, break us up and then kill her? That's harsh, brother.
 Well that's funny, because the two people closest to me are the two most sadistic.
 What do you think I should do?
 Isn't a bridesmaid's dress supposed to make you look like a freak of nature?
 He did not go easy on me. Apparently that's your fault. His argument was pretty convincing. I'd made up my mind... But then...
 Well, you're lucky I didn't ruin your face! Go inside, get the car keys from your mommy. I'm going to a wedding.
 On second thought...
 I'm taking it. I've been a vampire for a long time, Elena. It's been a blast. I would give it up in a second to be your husband. Your partner, the father of your kids...
 That's what you and Stefan keep saying, but you're wrong. I can. I can take it for us. Okay? Because even if it doesn't work, even if it all goes to hell, even if I'm miserable and alone, the smallest chance of a perfect life with you is infinitely better than an immortal one without you. And I know this, Elena. I love you... and I will love you until I take my last breath on this earth.
 Um, I think it's starting.
 Well, you're the one who couldn't keep your paws off me.
 I am, I am.
 Actually...
 Okay.
 Looks like I'm joining the human club! It's a big night for both of us.
 You, too, buddy.
 Waiting for you.
 I'm feeling symbolic.
 I believe you owe me a dance, Miss Gilbert.
 Dance with me, please.
 Elena?
 Come on. Hey, wake up. Elena?
 Come on, just drink it.
 Stefan? STEFAN?
 She won't wake up.
 She won't wake up. I don't understand.
 Yeah.
 Ah. Bonnie Bennett. You have no idea how good it is to hear your voice right now.
 I know. I'm glad you're safe. I was worried Kai already got to you.
 That's not all. He was at the wedding. Jo's dead, he killed her.
 And Elena got knocked out, and she's not waking up. The doctors keep telling me that there's nothing physically wrong with her. I don't know what to do, Bon.
 Oh, you didn't happen to pet a fuzzy, four-legged vampire-killing machine, did you?
 Easy, there's a cure in New Orleans. I'll get it for you. Just tell me what you did to Elena.
 One thing you're not gonna do? You're not gonna mess with me. I am in a very volatile place right now, and I will start beheading people that I don't like, starting with you, if she doesn't wake up
 So, what did you do to my damn girlfriend?
 Fix her! I know it's a spell. She's in perfect health.
 Please tell me you didn't.
 Just dance with me. This was supposed to be our big night.
 You won't wake up until she dies.
 He won, Elena.
 Bonnie.
 Hey.
 You're okay.
 I'm so sorry, Bonnie.
 Heads it is!
 You think I was gonna leave you all alone, huh?
 No way. I'm not out of nicknames for you yet.
 Okay, let's do this. You two are up first.
 You think she'll be safe here?
 Bonnie will spell it shut. We're under strict orders not to open it for anyone.
 ...That means it's time for me to say good-bye.
 You could have just told me what to do.
 You knew that the evil, selfish Damon Salvatore would give up the love of his life to save her best friend?
 Things are gonna be awfully dull around here without you.
 I was thinking of doing the starvation diet, because desiccation makes the time go faster...
 Ready to spend the next sixty years of my life without you in it? Who's ever gonna be ready for that?
 I love you, too.
 No idea.
 Can you read German?
 
 Is that really necessary?
 
 
 Hey! Ride in the tram tracks, don't look both ways...
 
 This isn't about what you need, Ric. It's about what I need. Just keeping you from jumping off a cliff keeps my mind off of the fact that my girlfriend's magical coma is linked to a Bennett witch that has a knack for avoiding permanent death.
 Yup.
 What?
 
 
 
 Oh, it's for you.
 
 If Stefan says he's got it, he's got it.
 
 
 
 Ugh, I've had some janky-ass bourbon in my time, but this is...
 You're wearing terrible shoes for trailing someone, your eyes suck, and you're slow.
 
 
 
 
 
 How else am I supposed to feel, Bonnie? Every time I look at you, all I see is not Elena.
 
 Anything I should know about?
 Well, I'm back! Want to tell me who the hell's living in our house?
 
 
 
 Who convinced you to save a town full of people you don't give a crap about? Because it's not your idea, and Matt can't think his way out of a paper bag, so it must be Caroline's.
 
 
 
 The first second, I thought of how amazing it would feel to have Elena in my arms again. By second number two, I was kissing her...
 And by the third, I remember you're my best friend, and that if anything ever happened to you, I would lose my mind. So, yes, Bonnie, I do know how long three seconds are.
 And I will wait for her, and you're gonna help me. You're stuck with me, too.
 No, Bonnie  the Heretics are out because my mother's a lunatic and everyone's too scared to stop her.
 
 
 
 I guess she upped her game.
 
 
 Let's open some windows, too. It reeks of dog in here. Which is impressive, considering Tyler's been with Jeremy for months.
 Tyler? No. Jeremy? Once. But are we really bringing that up right now?
 Oh, did she want that back? I mean, I think I packed it somewhere, alright?
 
 
 
 Hello, Mother.
 Couple things  A) Who the hell is that?
 
 I think there's been a bit of a mix-up. See, last night, I was in the town square, minding my own business, when I tripped and accidentally ripped Malcolm's heart out.
 Okay, wait  I admit it. I killed him. I killed him in cold blood, just like that. Stef and Caroline had nothing to do with it, so if you'll just kindly let her go...
 
 Wait! Li-Lily, uh 
 That's odd. Why can't I walk into my own house?
 And I only hear righteous "I told you so's." Look, I offered myself  Lily declined.
 Ah, planning a little midnight raid through the tunnels? Might a little tiny problem with that.
 We no longer own the house  i.e. we can't get in.
 Have no fear! I have a call in with the registrar's office, and I will find out who, exactly does own the house in a matter of minutes, at which point we kill said person, storm the castle, and save your damsel.
 
 
 
 Oh, Bonnie Bennett, Destroyer of Dreams. So, I take it things didn't go well with Ric?
 
 
 
 Because I'm going to get her back, and I didn't want you to do the very thing that you're about to do.
 
 Listen to me  killing Malcolm is classic-Damon and has nothing to do with you. Everybody knows that.
 Because I need your head in the game, Bon. I have a mission for you. It involves the person who owns my house...
 
 
 I'm just saying, when a guy's willing to let another guy die so his girl can live, there's usually something  
 Yeah, well, you just did, brother. Seal's down. I'll take the front door. Enjoy the tunnels.
 Hello there, old friend.
 Actually, you can. I don't know if you know this, but last night, Lily kidnapped Caroline  not very cool. So, I know we've had our issues, but I also know that you're not like Lily's Crazy-tics, so I was thinking  help me get her back?
 Wow. You know, I never thought I'd see the day when you'd choose to be Lily's errand-boy over us, but...
 
 Yeah. One is a permanent blood tie, a name, a legacy.
 
 Hello? Anybody burying somebody nobody cared about?
 No...
 No. No...
 No, no, no, no...
 Where is she?
 
 
 
 
 
 I believe Lily's exact words were, "As far from Mystic Falls as humanly possible." Now, I'm no Google Maps, but I'm thinking that's pretty far away.
 She has Elena. She's making me leave town, dude. For good.
 If the roles were reversed, what would you have done?
 
 This is her plan. She's slowly taking away everything we care about. She wants us to be mad at each other.
 ...While her and her family of freaks live in our house, getting closer and closer.
 Or, we do. You complain to Lily about your worthless brother that left town... All the while, I'm doing a little fracturing of my own.
 There were four Heretics at the funeral. Dead Malcolm makes five. But, in 1903, there were six, which means there's one more. And I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna negotiate a trade.
 We're gonna get them both back.
 You seen my phone?
 Got it!
 
 Relax! It's just 'til we hunt down Lily's lone-wolf Heretic and swap him out for my girlfriend in a coma.
 Pretty soon, thanks to Donovan. A phrase no one has uttered... ever.
 He's checking Lily's cell phone records.
 Hi, Bon-Bon!
 Who wants to go to Myrtle Beach?
 Well, that's too bad, because Lily made a bunch of phone calls that bounced off a cell tower there, and something tells me she's not making plans for her spring break.
 Tell you what  you ask him yourself after he's safe in my car's trunk, hmmm? So, anyone up for an old-fashioned hostage-swap?
 I'll even give you shotgun!
 Okay  fair trade. One Heretic in good condition for the coffin housing Elena.
 
 B-Town stuns him with magic, you shoot him with vervain, I 
  Snap his neck.
 Any other suggestions of how we can rid Bonnie of this mysterious pain she's in, Ric?
 Room service! Free shrimp!
 
 Hey, all right...
 
 
 
 Let me translate for you  my friends were playing with some mystical tool they didn't quite understand, and now Bonnie's chasing her own white rabbit around the farm...
 Just think of it as one big magical toke!
 Siphon the damn visions, we don't tell Lily that we saw you avoiding whatever mission you were sent to do, and we'll call it a day.
 Good news? Your visions are gone. Bad news? So's Oscar.
 We need to find him right now.
 Aw, come on! I mean, yo  I  A litt 
 ...Kind of. Ric, tell her what happened.
 ...I live with the guy! Guys... know stuff.
 
 Wait! I'm not gonna be stuck in the middle of this. No, no  you sort this out. I'm gonna go find our bargaining chip.
 I lied. I do remember you. I was fighting for the South. It's not exactly a time I like to reminisce about in front of my friends.
 
 
 Let's just say I'd like to cash you in for something way better.
 Aw, my besties are buds again! Let's go make a deal.
 You should have come yourself.
 Gettysburg, 1863  if that had been you, it would have changed the entire course of my life.
 And I was supposed to be your son.
 Your prodigal Heretic was Fear and Loathing in the armpit of Myrtle Beach.
 Don't worry, Mommy  he's in the middle of a vervain detox. Give me Elena. Maybe I won't kill him.
 
 So did I. Why don't we end this mutual disdain once and for all? Give me Elena, you get your son back.
 
 Heh. You girls, too.
 Why so gloomy? Looks like you got everything you wanted.
 No, not yet. But, if you don't do exactly as I say, that could change real fast.
 So, you gonna invite me in?
 Mother, tell me you have Elena.
 No can do. I'm about to wake him up from his little vervain nap.
 
 Spare the lecture, Mommy.
 
 Oscar...
 
 I can smell the blood on you, buddy.
 Huh?
 You've gotta be kidding me!
 
 To get Elena back!
 
 We need to get rid of this body.
 Ugh!
 All right...
 Hello.
 Oh. Hello.
 
 
 Yeah.
 
 Oscar turned the tables, and he knocked me out, and he took off. I lost my one and only bargaining chip.
 
 
 Screw it. Let's just get this guy to the furnace.
 
 No!
 
 It's not for me, Ric! Why does everything have to be about me today?
 So, how goes the diversion?
 
 ...I think we're close.
 Pfff.
 Bonnie? You are officially the most terrifying person I know.
 Easy there, buddy.
 
 Well... We'll talk about it on the way. Smile for Mommy!
 Yeahhh. Okay.
 Are you sure you want to do this to Jo?
 No offense, Ric, but I was asking Bonnie.
 Trust me  you do not want to make Lily wait. I learned that the hard way.
 Here. This will take the edge off.
 Not 'til we get our story straight. We were in Myrtle Beach. We were wasted. You passed out.
 
 
 Not until you get one right! Multiple choice  You were in Myrtle Beach, A) Partying too much; B) 
 HEY!
 
 Damn! Don't shoot the one person who can solve this case for you, Detective Dumbass.
 Oscar's acid-trip went from bad to worse. I've been tracking him through the woods.
 Perfect. At least I know where he's going.
 
 Give me a break! I don't want to add your death to a long list of things that are already my fault.
 
 
 I'm moving back to Mystic Falls.
 
 I want one more thing.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Good morning, lovebirds!
 
 Mmm.
 Why such a Grumpy Gus? I thought you'd want to celebrate today. I finally got Elena tucked away safely. You're snuggled with Caroline in this tragically tiny bed, and Ric? Ric saved his lady from the great beyond! Everything is coming up Salvatore, so much so that I have decided to turn over a new leaf.
 Yeah. I am gonna be the man that does right by Elena, all on my own, by keeping her in my heart instead of keeping her underfoot.
 I'm gonna need a little help with the dirty work, so rise and shine, brother. We are going to interrogate a tall, beautiful Heretic with a terrible attitude.
 Rings a bell.
 Hmm. I'm missing something here.
 Hang on. Valerie as in v-card Valerie? "Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am," broke your heart and, uh...?
 
 That's a hefty fine, young lady!
 
 You did realize that by taking a deputy's SUV that every move you made would be tracked, right?
 That car? You bet I'll move that car. But first, I need to ask you why you killed your faux-brother Oscar and framed me for the murder.
 
 I'm gonna go to my car, get my phone. I'm gonna call Lily. See if she knows.
 
 AGH!
 Okay. I think I got it.
 You killed Oscar because he knew how to get to Julian, but you hate Julian because he's a sadistic, depraved, no-good monster that Lily desperately wants to bring home.
 
 Speaking of which, how did you two, um... meet?
 
 And then, you were supposed to meet after that, right? Like, under a bridge, or a tree, or a romantic park bench...
 You know, when you didn't show, this guy wrote ten pages in his journal about how the sun would never shine as bright, and the food would never taste as sweet...
 Yes. I read them. Your hiding places were always crap.
 You really crushed the guy.
 Ouch!
 No. Stefan's in. He's in! I'll watch.
 Don't worry, Care-Bear! I have issues a "No Hanky-Panky" zone. No former flames will reignite on my way! Uh-uh. No how.
 There's more gas in the tank, sassy-pants.
 
 What are you gonna do, charm him to death?
 Mmm!
 Hey, lovebirds! Quit your bickering. Let's get this campfire started.
 Huh. Casket Emporium. Clever.
 So, Lily's still carrying a torch for some moldy, old corpse, hmm?
 Phoenix Stone, huh? Never heard of it.
 
 Wait  what do you mean, whoever we brought back?
 How's everything with Professor Frankenstein and his rebooted bride?
 Oh, good. Glad to hear it. So, quick favor  I'm gonna need you to tell Ric that we made a tiny mistake, and that that's not his wife.
 Yeah... It turns out that the stone doesn't actually have any magic juice to bring back any old corpse. It's more like a supernatural holding cell for a bunch of lost vampire souls, one of which you accidentally shoved into Jo's body.
 
 Bad idea! Cut the conversation short. Call Ric from the car on the way home.
 
 ...I just don't think that she'd want me to crush his spirit like that. Let him down gently?
 
 
 Lot better-looking than our old man, I'll give Mom that.
 Should we, uh... get a match?
 
 Technically, she's been a bit vague on the details... I mean, mass-murderer, homicidal maniac, and typical, run-of-the-mill bad-guy stuff... But, before we just hand him over, you mind telling us what we're missing here? Who is this, really?
 A thing or two.
 Who?
 Is that true?
 Screw Julian! I'll kill you.
 GAH!
 Ohhh...
 
 
 
 Screw the new leaf! She stole Elena from me, and every ounce of happiness I've ever known! I'm not gonna let her just walk away from that!
 I'm fine. I'm okay.
 
 
 Burning that bastard's body would've been too good for Lily.
 I want to give her that man she's cherished and loved and missed for a hundred years.
 I want her to run into Julian's arms, and I want her to remember what it feels like to have him returned. I want her to taste true happiness...
 And then, I want to rip his head off right in front of her. I want to break her heart. I want to break her spirit. I want to destroy her.
 
 Well, glad to see you boarding this train to Crazytown, Bonnie Bennett! I was getting lonely all by myself.
 So, tell me  what thoughts go through a man's mind before he decides, "I think I'll take the ones with the roosters?"
 Hang on.
 Glitter.
 When's the last time you talked to your fiancée?
 What time was it, and what'd she say?
 Well, she's not answering her phone now.
 I don't care. Get her on the horn. Stefan's being hunted again, and it's only a matter of time before Caroline's the bait that's used to lure him out.
 Oh. Well, I guess the old ball and chain won't make it home for dinner, after all, will she?
 "Lily Salvatore requests your presence to celebrate our town's peaceful spirit and introduce a new friend. This evening, 5 00." Hmm. Looks like Mom raised her man-crush from the dead.
 Not just no tie  no going.
 To watch Lily bat her eyes at her zombie douche-brain boy-toy? Thanks, but I'd rather stay home and stub my toe repeatedly.
 
 Mom, who convinced Kai to link Elena's life with Bonnie's so I'd be miserable for the next six-plus decades.
 Julian makes her happy, Stefan. More time they spend together, the happier she gets, the more tragic it'll be in six months when I hand-deliver his heart to her.
 Yeah, you know, give or take. Let her get her hopes up. Let her start planning their entire eternity... and then 
  Squish, he's dead.
 What? No tie?
 I missed my stash!
 
 Can't let you do that.
 Because Lily just "rearranged the furniture," and she needs a little time to live in it, you know? Fall in love with the whole feng shui of it all.
 
 I'm Damon.
 
 Wait. Has he nev ?
 Have you never heard the story about the guy that tries to kill the vampire during a game of pool?
 Well, there's this guy. He's about Stefan's build, maybe a wee bit bigger... little more chiseled, less height on the hair.
 Right, so this vampire that he wants to kill is at least three hundred years older than him.
 And anyone and everyone with half a brain knew he was being an idiot, but he had this inexplicable obsession.
 So, he bets the vampire in a game of pool, and just as the vamp is setting up for his last shot...
 Never got a chance.
 Yeah. Another vampire comes out of nowhere and stops him. Like I said, he was being an idiot.
 Thanks.
 
 Here I thought she slept standing up like a horse...
 Do you know what this means?
 It means Mom's happy. Another couple months of this, and she'll have convinced herself it's forever, and that's when we strike, Stefan.
 You know something! Look at you  murdery, vengeful. It's very humanity-off Stefan, except your switch is intact, which means you know something. So, spit it out!
 Oh, really?
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on  does this bottle say "Default-Deputy?" No. No. It says, "Damon's good stuff. Do not touch."
 Ugh! Nnngh.
 Well, I see Stefan's plan went swimmingly. Probably explains why your fake-guests are leaving.
 Oh, well, we wouldn't want to wear out our welcome. Brother, let's hit the road.
 Okay...
 Knock it off!
 
 This is why there is a hard line between good and evil, Stefan! I don't cross over into your territory. Don't cross into mine!
 You know, I never thought I'd say this, Stefan, but I miss the days when you just let your big brother handle all the dirty work. Quite frankly, I can't figure out why you have such a big beef with this guy, unless V-card Valerie got under your skin.
 
 What?
 Oh...
 ...Why didn't you just tell me?
 
 Elena and I talked about starting a family. I mean, it was fantasy, but still. We secretly knew as long as she was a vampire, it's all it was. Then, she took the cure, and all of a sudden, having a real family was a possibility. Granted, it'd be dysfunctional as hell, but we'd have a real human family.
 
 What about you?
 
 If you want Julian dead, I'll help you. Tomorrow, tonight, now... I'm in.
 Just enough time for me to get in, take out little Miss Stabby-Pants, and grab Caroline.
 It's simple. It's classic. Come on!
 
 There's no way Stefan didn't see Caroline's broadcast. He'll be here in a minute. When he gets here, pump him full of vervain so he can't hero his way in there.
 She doesn't want Caroline. She wants him! If he goes in there, he's dead.
 
 
 Is that cornbread I smell?
 
 Whatever happened to taking out Julian? Remember him? Killed what would have been your firstborn? You know, I cleared out my entire schedule so we could make that guy count worms... Unless you're too busy baking.
 
 
 Did we, Stefan?
 What I think Stefan's trying to say is... you have really crappy taste.
 
 Best... Thanksgiving... ever!
 Well, you didn't think Dad was a monster at first. But, somewhere along the way, this little warning-light started blinking "Psycho! Psycho!" You just need that little light to blink again.
 1851. Hmmm. Jog my memory, brother  was that the year that Father took me out to the farm and made me behead my pet turkey?
 Oooh. That was a doozy.
 I cannot.
 
 Mother... please do not make me eat her.
 
 
 
 But pointless.
 Huh. Does that burn?
 
 Nope. Guess not.
 
 I have finished. May I be excused?
 
 
 No.
 He would tell the truth.
 I took it!
 AHHHHH!
 I didn't take Giuseppe's money. I only confessed because I was afraid of what he'd do to Stefan.
 And you did nothing?
 You did NOTHING?
 A little tip from a professional? Next time you want to kill a bazillion-year-old psycho, don't pick a sword from the junior section.
 Bastard links his life to my mom's and then engages in a duel? What is this, "Hamlet" community theater? Heh.
 He's using Lily as a human shield. Guess he'd forgotten about the part that half the people actually left in this town hate her guts.
 
 Ungh!
 ARGH!
 
 What?
 
 You're never gonna stop straining to find one tiny speck of redemption in Lily, and she's never gonna stop disappointing you.
 I don't want to know the whole story, Stefan! I don't want to know any more excuses, or lies, or anything that tells me anything other than the way I know it went down  our mother faked her death, left her sons behind, started a new family, and went out of her way to forget us forever! That is the only story that matter, Stefan.
 She tossed us aside without any concern what would happen to us. As far as I'm concerned, she deserves what she gets.
 She deserves what she gets.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah...
 Did you come back to get your dish?
 
 
 That's right. Dallas. The home of big hair and horrible presidents.
 Oh, so, the mystery guest makes an appearance. Why don't you do me a favor? Come a little closer so I can sort of see you.
 Mom? It's been a long time.
 What's the plan?
 
 But, hey, complicated plan "A" sounds like a happy compromise.
 
 Ah. Stefan-distraction machine. Please tell me you're not coming.
 
 
 Looks like someone's having fun.
 
 Plan's postponed till further notice.
 Fine. Julian dies tonight, but it's no skin off my back if you're still linked to the guy when I shove a stake through his heart.
 
 
 Hell of a party.
 It's an anniversary party! Guess we figured we'd come support the pretty one and her mean girlfriend. Hmm?
 
 It's pinball, and I have the high score. Did you break that link yet?
 All right, Nancy Grace, enough. Let the adults handle this.
 Ow!
 Okay, this vervain stings like a bitch, and your family drama makes the prospect of hell look like Disneyland. So please, one swift stab straight through the heart. Let's get this over with.
 You chose your Heretics over Stefan and me every chance you had. Why stop now?
 Kill me! Come on! Do it, Lily!
 You made your bed.
 
 Mom? Are you still here?
 Okay, Mom, listen... While you're still here, there's something that's been nagging at me for... a long time.
 I'm so sorry.
 
 Well, this it? This the whole funeral party?
 Where's your girlfriend?
 
 I'm sure he just couldn't find the right words to say.
 Heh. All right. Let's get her done.
 
 Next.
 Well?
 Good point, brother. How's this? Ahem.
 Lily, you were a terrible mother when you were alive, and you were a terrible mother when you were dead.
 You're right! It does feel good. Huh.
 It's a pub crawl, Stef! That's the whole point. Don't be such a Grinch, or you'll get coal in your stocking.
 So what's it gonna be... Uncle Stefan? Unkie Stefy?
 I got it! "Creepy Dude Who Hangs Out With Mom Who's Not Dad."
 
 So diplomatic. You're gonna make an amazing not-father. It's kind of your thing, isn't it, hmm?
 Just barely not being a father.
 You know what? You need me, little brother. Sucks for you, but Julian's almost 500 years old, and you ain't taking him alone 
  No matter how many vervain darts and stakes you have on you. Hmm?
 Sounds like you should have brought Beau then. I'm here to help. Trust me. I got more vervain syringes and grenades strapped to my body. One wrong step, and I'm vampire shrapnel. Relax!
 Eggnog?
 Just so we're clear, me helping you kill Julian is your Christmas present, so don't be expecting any socks or a TV or anything.
 We will. Bonnie did the locator spell, and she said Sunbury. We're in Sunbury, so...
 Oops. I'm dry. Pit stop.
 Merry Christmas, brother. Think we found him.
 Gonna be a lot of disappointed faces Christmas morning.
 
 I'm not trying to say anything.
 What I am saying is... maybe we should just take a little bit of a beat, you know? I mean, look around. Julian is clearly off the proverbial rails here.
 Hi. I'm level-headed Damon. I only come out when Stefan goes a little cuckoo, and since you're letting your mommy and could-have-been-daddy issues drive you right now...
 I do! 100%. But not if it means us dying. So, I think we should just stop and think about some backup.
 Don't be so dramatic, Stefan. I got this.
 Bon Bon, sorry to do this to you, but...
 Well, isn't it so great to feel loved and needed? So, Julian...
 Yes, yes, you did, which led us to this Santa-infested hell-hole. But is there, like, a way to do, like, a zoom-in spell, or something maybe a little more accurate? Like an address or...
 Right. Well, here's the deal, Bonnie. Stefan's here, and he's being kind of a crazy person. He's breathing down my neck, and I was just kind of hoping you might have some information for me, you know what I mean?
 Brilliant.
 Look at me, pulling my weight.
 
 What are you waiting for, Stefan? A breakdown? A teary, emotional, "I'm sorry. It's all my fault?" Well, you're gonna be waiting a long time, bro.
 
 
 Because, see, Stefan and I thought you had some really great maniacal plan, but it turns out you're just a drunk sorority girl who ruins everyone's night by losing her cell phone.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Well, I didn't want to lie to the woman.
 She didn't deserve my forgiveness.
 Giving her a hall pass, like always. Her little angel.
 Road trip's over, brother. You want to go back and risk it? Go for it. I'm going home.
 
 I'm not exactly sure who "she" is.
 Stefan kidnapped Mary Louise? Ballsy.
 Hmm.
 Look, Jules. You and I, we got no beef, okay? You didn't kill my baby, and I don't blame you for Lily's death. It was her own stupid fault.
 Let's just stick with "Lily." Mother's incidental.
 I needed space in my closet.
 No. It was nonexistent.
 She killed herself.
 
 Well, you could certainly try.
 Aah!
 Stefan!
 
 Henry!
 Come, Henry. We are getting you out of here.
 My brother.
 Colonel, sir?
 I would like to request two weeks leave to go home, sir.
 I fear my brother is in a very bad way, sir. I would not ask if I did not believe he truly needs me. I do not wish to shirk my duties. If there is something you need done, I shall do it.
 
 For a chance to see my brother, I will gladly accept it.
 Consider it done. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
 
 About what, Henry?
 It is true. I could give a damn about this war, Henry. To be honest, I only enlisted to please my father.
 It is not my fault they deserted, Henry. They made their beds. But now, they're our ticket home. Come.
 Hello, ma'am. Could you spare some dinner for two hungry soldiers?
 I do not need to remind you that quartering is your wartime duty, not to mention the law.
 Thank you, ma'am.
 Hello. We are your surprise dinner guests.
 
 Henry here's going to freshen up. Clean hands, clean mind.
 I'm sure you're not one of those families hiding munitions from the war effort, but orders being what they are, it is my duty to check.
 I'm glad to see someone takes the warning about the devil and idle hands seriously.
 I see that, ma'am.
 I do not want any trouble.
 See, that is the problem. I want to go home too.
 Wait here.
 Please, enough blood has been shed. Lay down your weapon. Please.
 
 You cannot be here. You died of consumption. We buried you in Mystic Falls.
 You died. I was there. This doesn't make any sense.
 This isn't real.
 In 1863. I got a letter from Stefan. He seemed hopeless. I just wanted to go home to him. Even though I had my doubts, I started to round up deserters. It all went so wrong so fast.
 What do you mean?
 How do you know that?
 Why? For what? They were deserters. They ambushed us. I didn't come here looking to kill anybody.
 
 
 
 Ohh.
 Like I just spent a day in the life of young Damon Salvatore.
 Nope.
 But, you don't look so good...
 Wow. It's not that I was expecting a parade, but where's my parade?
 Time stood still. I get it. No offense taken. Where's Stefan?
 Where is he, Bonnie?
 You're telling me my brother's still stuck in here and you brought me out first?
 Where is he, Bonnie?
 We have to get him out.
 
 You store him in the closet?
 Well, he's not now, Bonnie, which begs the question  how do you not see an unconscious vampire walk out the front door?
 
 No one's scorching anyone, not yet. Listen. Julian left a note. He's clearly luring us somewhere for a reason, guys.
 
 Think you have enough juice?
 
 I didn't think so.
 Can you find him?
 Drink?
 
 You know what I'm curious about?
 Why the Phoenix Stone made my mother a character in my hellscape when it had so many other options of torture to choose from.
 Well, why didn't she?
 What the hell's that supposed to mean?
 Blondie, you do not get to make this moment the only time you ever decided to shut up. Tell me. What am I missing?
 
 Well, you're just gonna have to settle for the ornery brother.
 What's that putrid smell?
 Are we really doing this?
 Gladly. As soon as Stefan's home and his soul sucked out of that rock, we can all sit and pop open a bottle of chardonnay, chat, and eat bonbons 'til the sun comes up.
 I had a slightly different experience. Overall, I give hell one star for horror and two very disappointed thumbs down for clever use of parable.
 
 
 No, Stefan! Stef...
 No...
 This isn't real.
 Closer to what? Closer to what?!
 Sir, w-what would you say if I asked for two weeks' leave to go see my brother?
 I thought so. What if I was willing to help you with your little deserter problem, for example?
 I'm on it. Just to get the rules clear, I bring these deserters back alive, I go home to see my brother?
 All right, then.
 Yes. No. I mean... I got to admit, things are a little fuzzy right now, Henry.
 Technically, yes, but I'm starting to think they stand for something much bigger now.
 That they are, Henry, but they're my ticket out of here, and I've got to bring them back alive.
 Good day, ma'am. Could you spare some dinner for two hungry soldiers? And before you say no, I'd like to remind you that quartering is the law in these parts. I also love pie.
 Thank you kindly.
 
 
 Granny, I'm gonna have to kindly ask you set that knife down and stand over here by the table, please. Please, ma'am. You, too, kid. I'm going to have to ask you all to stand here together by the table.
 Trust me. I got this.
 No need. We won't get to dinner.
 I know you've got two deserters in the basement. Now, no one has to get hurt. We are simply going to take these men to our camp, and that is that.
 No!
 No, no, no.
 Well, that didn't go well.
 Oh... Don't worry. I know who I am. I also know you're not real.
 You did it solo. Got it. Good news is I know where Julian's keeping Stefan's body, so you can sit back, relax, and not have to worry about that locator spell.
 Oh, right. Spoiler alert. When you were working on me, Julian stole Stefan's body. I'm gonna go get it back.
 You're not supposed to be here.
 Never even occurred to me. So is this the part where we compare notes, analyze the symbolism, convince each other that we're survivors?
 Cheers.
 It was just a gruesome Civil War saga. Confederate flags, carnage, lots of lives going kaput.
 Some rock's obsession with my personal accountability in a wartime tragedy? Not particularly.
 What?
 Of course. I felt a burning desire to get home to my sad-sack of a brother so I could help him get over a girl he just met.
 I knew it.
 You're not real.
 Sorry, brother. Got to hit the reset button.
 Ugh. Get your gun, Henry.
 Because I'm starting to see a pattern, and you and I are gonna solve this little puzzle.
 
 So, here's what I'm thinking  Why today? Out of all of Damon Salvatore's greatest-hits, this farmhouse kerfluffle was barely a B-side. And then I realized... This was the first time I ever had blood on my hands. I took that mission. I gave the order.
 I'm not sick! The point is, that the weeks after the farmhouse massacre, when I was crushed by guilt and self-loathing, do you know the one person in the world that I wanted to talk to?
 My brother. That has to be the solution to the hell-puzzle, too. We find a way to get to Stefan, we stop living this day over and over and over again. Does that make sense?
 
 Hello, beautiful. What a great smile you have. I'm gonna need you, your daughter, and grandma to come out here on the porch with Private Wattles. Soldier's orders. Come on out, ladies. That's right. Thank you. Right here, just right there on the porch. Very nice. Stay on the porch. It's a nice day.
 I know you're down there. I need you to toss out your weapons on the count of three, or I will kill your host family. One... Two...
 Three.
 That's good. Now, come out one at a time, arms raised.
 Let's try this again.
 Okay, I know you have a grenade. This time, I need you to gently slide the grenade out to me first. Next, I want your revolvers, and I want all this on the count of three, or I kill your host family. One...
 Two...
 Three.
 Now, come out one at a time, arms raised.
 I'm really starting to hate you three.
 Stefan  never write me again.
 MAIL!
 
 Damnit.
 
 You know what the shortest distance between Point A and Point B is, Henry?
 A straight line. To get out of this hell, I've got to see my brother, so I'm going straight to him. I'm deserting to Mystic Falls.
 You know how you always say I'm a hero, Henry?
 I'm no hero.
 No way...
 Well, this is different. Where the hell is everybody?
 
 
 Well, well. If it isn't the light at the end of the tunnel.
 I was trying to protect your fragile emotions, Stefan. You're the reason I took the mission to begin with.
 
 
 
 
 What are you talking about?
 
 
 
 
 I... I wanted... My mother.
 
 Ugh!
 Yes, he does.
 Because you tried to take Elena away from me.
 Because you took the one thing that made me happy. Because you weren't strong enough to leave your husband. Because you got sick and left us. Because you never came back!
 I hate you because you could've come back so many times, but you never did. I lost you the first time when Father sent you away with consumption, and then we brought you back from this prison world, and then I lost you again to your other family. And now, I'm losing you to death. Three times, I lost you. Three times, I had the chance to tell you everything I want to tell you, and three times I ruined it.
 
 No. No. No.
 No. No. No.
 No, we weren't done! I gotta get her back. I gotta get her back!
 
 Send me back. I know what to do now.
 
 
 Why am I still here? It wasn't real... This isn't real...
 No.
 
 
 Bon.
 
 I didn't know where I was. I didn't know I was out 
 Ohh.
 Oh, yup. I saw this coming.
 Stefan.
 Stefan.
 No vervain this time? We switching up the menu?
 Oh, I'm calm.
 No, no, no. You're gonna say to me. You're gonna say to me, I screwed up so bad. I nearly killed all of our friends because I thought I was stuck in a fake hell-world.
 Huh?
 Wait. You skipped a bunch of stuff. First, I'm supposed to say I see the error of my ways, and then you tell me that that's not good enough, and then you judge me harder. And then I say something mean, but true, that totally throws you off balance.
 Oh. That's pretty generous, considering I just stabbed your pregnant girlfriend in the chest...
 Yeah, Yeah it does. Well I'm here. And it's real. I'm ready for my bro hug.
 I'll wait until you've unchained me, brother.
 
 Tyler Lockwoof.
 Yeah, Stefan, I thought my allergies were acting up.
 Oh, you know. We had to evacuate. Scary Heretics. Fictional mining fires. You weren't CC'd on the memo?
 So what is he talking about? I know you didn't manage to screw the whole town up all over again while I was on my weekend trip to limbo.
 You delegated Deputy Doolittle to patrol the streets with his witchy ride-along? Are you sure Bonnie put the right soul back in your body? I mean, what happened to your hero-hair campaign to protect Mystic Falls?
 
 Alright, brother. You have a captive audience. What'd I miss?
 Hello, lovers. Miss me?
 So you got out of hell, you're on the up-and-up, and then you started hallucinating me as a waiter. I mean, I couldn't be a manager or something?
 
 I'm not gonna have a psychotic break, brother. I promise.
 I'm 100% okay.
 Great.
 Yeah. All good.
 Oh, boy.
 Wah-psh!
 Lovely.
 
 Picture me as a soldier in gray being shot to death over and over and over again while the ghost of Mommie Dearest floated on her harpy wings, saying, "I told you so, Damon."
 Well, I think that was the point. I just realized all I had to do was cry some big-boy tears and tell Mommy I was sorry.
 It did the trick, because right after that, I went toward the red light in the sky....
 What about you? How'd you pass your existential dealio?
 Look who infested my town because he has nothing better to do with his eternity.
 You gonna take that, hmm?
 Yeah...
 One too many pieces of vampire trash.
 
 
 ...Very realistic head-trip.
 We should probably skip the check.
 
 Worse than you envisioning me as a waiter? Who was I next? A busboy? A valet?
 You're lucky you have her to hold onto, brother.
 Yeah, get out of here, Caroline! Before I rip those babies right out of your belly.
 Where's Mom when you need her? 'Cause fat chance you're winning this showdown.
 I'm a piece of the stone puzzle. If you figure it out, I'll leave you alone. Until then...
 So? Pins and needles over here, brother. What did you do?
 Well, that explains why I smelled like gas when I woke up.
 Mind giving me a hand?
 
 What's your name?
 
 And be honest, now.
 I killed the love of my life. Burned her alive while she was asleep.
 I also beat one of her best friends 'til he was unconscious and left him for dead, if we're keeping score...
 Actually, I can use a ride.
 I thought Elena had changed me. I thought she made me a better man, but... I was wrong. I was so wrong. It was always gonna end up this way. With me destroying her. That's what my whole tour-of-duty in the Phoenix Stone has taught me  is that I'm permanently damaged goods.
 You ever feel that way, Cooper?
 Well, you're lucky, Coop. I'm gonna kill you now.
 
 Honestly, I can't imagine caring about anyone ever again. Not a single, solitary soul...
 
 Hmm, I think...
 It was something about you gutting me and feeding my entrails to Stefan.
 
 "Last words?" Hmm. Whoa, that's a lot of pressure. I guess if I had to, I would phrase it as a question  What's the deal with the "X marks the spot" postcard, hmm? Who are you running from, Big J?
 It wouldn't happen to be a sword-wielding vixen that sent your ass straight to hell?
 Ooh! Ooh! I've hit a nerve. Hell-hottie afoot. The end times are near!
 I mean, I'm assuming she's hot, right? Hmm?
 
 Mmm?
 Elena.
 
 What else you got?
 No. I want to go again.
 Who's next? Huh? Who's next?
 You made a wrong turn, brother. This isn't some hell-survivor support group.
 I'm in.
 Then it should be a good fight.
 There's nothing to get through, Stefan. This is what I deserve.
 You don't back off, brother, I will destroy you like I've destroyed everything good I've ever touched.
 
 Godspeed, brother.
 Whoo!
 That makes sense. You were a lonely little tadpole.
 That's why you need to surround yourself with lowlife, degenerate bloodsuckers like these.
 
 Go ahead. Rip my heart out.
 Do it.
 Nowhere in particular, I don't have a destination.
 
 That's it.
 "Flip my switch?" I'm not gonna flip my switch, Stefan. I want to feel pain. I want to feel every miserable moment of this miserable life.
 I killed her. I killed Elena.
 It was all Henry's idea. He told me I needed to free my true self, so I kidnapped Tyler and made him take me to her coffin. And then I burned her to ashes.
 So go ahead. Stand by me. Tell me you'll never walk away. Go ahead, Stefan, come on. Do it. Do it!
 Hello. Again.
 
 More of a bourbon man, but... what do I got to lose?
 That's all the bourbon.
 You got to go.
 No, we are not. 
 I'll call you.
 That's an oldie but a goodie. Hope he has enough chairs to take out the rest of Julian's backup dancers.
 Um...
 Um...
 Krystal.
 Krystal.
 'With a "K."
 Go ahead, let it all out, Bonnie. I'm a vile cheater. I couldn't even wait a year.
 Hey, heard you got a thing for the grannies.
 Hold, please. 
 
 
 
 So here's the thing, Bon-Bon...
 I'm gonna need a... huge favor.
 Great, now we have the world's ugliest letter opener to give to Enzo.
 
 
 Be my guest.
 You're right, Bonnie. You are my best friend, which is why I can't tell you. So I'm asking you leave it alone! Thank you.
 Got your damn sword.
 This is the part where you say thank you...?
 Enzo? Remember Thanksgiving of '53? We were locked in neighboring cells, and I told you I was thankful for you through that little hole in the wall? I take that back.
 Not bad for an eighty-year-old corpse.
 Ooh, looks and manners! I am...
 Hey!
 You want your sword? Go fetch!
 
 Do you hear someone talking?
 It's about to get a lot worse. Hottie Huntress has the Sword and she's coming right for you.
 I'm working on that.
 I screwed up bad, Bonnie. I gotta make it right.
 Well... You know, you look a lot like my girlfriend and her three doppelgängers.
 You want to send me back to hell? Let me tell you something, lady. I'm already there.
 Stefan...
 It's tempting. The ropes make it easier to kill you.
 Really? You know what was on my list of things to do today? Buy more bourbon. That was it. That was the most stressful part of my day. And then you blackmailed me and screwed me into this scavenger hunt, and now my brother's paying the price!
 No choice?! That's an interesting notion.
 I'll tell you what. Why don't we let fate decide what happens? Heads, you live. Tails, you don't.
 No, sir, she's not. I watched her burn with my own eyes.
 Really?
 
 Take me to her.
 Good.
 Where are you?
 Elena's alive.
 
 As if ruining his life wasn't enough for me to worry about, now we get to wonder when you and Valerie exchanged numbers.
 Where the hell are we?
 The Armory... Never heard of it.
 You?
 And, for three easy payments of $19.99, we, too, can be members.
 How about we just cut to the part where they can save my brother? Where's the cavalry, man?
 Well, I'll have to discuss this with my counsel.
 Where's Stefan?
 You know he has a girlfriend, right? Blonde, sweet, cute as a button. You're not actually her.
 You don't want to do that. I have a way to take down Rayna, but it requires him to come to me.
 
 
 Yes, I did. As a matter of fact, I've said that word more times today than I have in my entire life.
 Why?
 
 Flag on the play. Like an idiot, Stefan didn't renew the minutes on his cell phone. We'll call you when we connect. Come on Bon, I want to beat traffic.
 Yeah, I do, Enzo. I also know that you allowed me to believe Elena was dead so I'd help you kill Rayna, who's already escaped your custody once. Then, you tricked me into saving your ass, which resulted in Rayna getting this stupid sword, and now I have Stefan's 1863 Siphon-crush telling me that you all are shady people. So, Bon-Bon here and I are gonna go cook up a Plan B. But, thanks anyway.
 Oh... Ohhhh...
 Lockwood?
 Why the hell is he here?
 ...That's why you have Elena.
 So, here we all are  in a cell. That's how you take care of people?
 
 Thanks. But you know I'm a sucker for the front row.
 
 Good news, tween wolf  you're about to get your sweet revenge on me.
 
 Because up until yesterday, I thought Elena was dead. Turns out, she's not.
 That should knock your ass out 'til the sun comes up.
 Good boy. Off to dream of squirrels and Milk Bones.
 Ohhh, that's not good.
 Easy, pal. Breeeeeathe. Good boy.
 They're slowing your transition. Pick up, Stefan!
 Feeling's mutual, brother. Listen, you wouldn't happen to be at that place Valerie sent you to, would you?
 There's a chance I'm gonna have to tango with a werewolf tonight, and it'd suck a lot less if I knew there was an antidote en route.
 
 
 
 You're a witch! Blink really hard.
 Enzo opened it up with the palm of his hand. You gotta get him down here right now.
 Why the hell not?
 Bonnie, Tyler is one loose vertebrae from making me his dinner, so figure this out. Please. No pressure.
 Easy, boy. I do not want to kill you.
 
 Bonnie should be here any second 
 Bonnie, wait! Don't!
 Bonnie, listen  if you open that door, Tyler will kill you, too.
 This is my mess. Go. Go!
 NOO!
 
 
 You're not healing. Why aren't you healing?
 Bonnie, hey! Bon!
 
 Fine. Be that way. Ignore me. By the way, once whatever crap Enzo gave you is out of your system and magic works on you again, I'm going to give you my blood and heal you, okay? But, in the meantime, there's something I want you to know. You are a terrible friend. You know that? Do you have any idea what I'd have to go through if you'd have died today? Huh? Years of guilt. Crippling, self-loathing guilt. Not to mention the resentment I'd feel if I was forced to break in a new drinking buddy...
 You're not supposed to die for me, Bon. Neither is my brother. But, no matter what I say, or how hard I try and drill it into your skulls, you're not going to stop trying. Which is why I have to take myself out of the equation. It all ends tomorrow. You'll never have to worry about me again.
 Oh, good! You're up. How's Bonica-magica?
 
 Well, I'm a man with a plan!
 
 
 
 
 Look around, Bonnie. I'm not here for the filmy hospital pudding. You almost died in that place, and I'll never let that happen again.
 Promise me you will stay out of this, Bon. No one needs to get hurt for me anymore. I can handle Rayna.
 Barking up the wrong vampire, there, sister. Stefan's antisocial. Not many friends. Actually, no friends at all. But, I hear he has a very handsome and charming brother. You might want to talk to him.
 I know, right? To be honest... I'm not that brave. However, I did have a shockingly effective ally tell me that you were here.
 Aw, you almost said "friend." How sweet!
 
 Get rid of this thing.
 Yeah  you know where I can get a buzz-saw?
 Ugh. Here we go.
 They're my girlfriend's. And, given the fact that you two look exactly alike, you should be able to fit into them.
 It wouldn't have to if it just stayed dead.
 Bit of a pickle here, Ray. I got big plans.
 Kind of, actually. But, I can't go on vacation until I do something about you. See, I can't relax and sip Mai Tais while you're out hunting my brother. And, every time I kill you, you just Phoenix back to life.
 It's a dill.
 Tempting. Truly. But, I kind of owe him.
 
 So... hunting vampires is your identity. Your fundamental "This is who I am" in a nutshell.
 You ever wonder if there's a way to change that?
 
 Because I changed. Temporarily, as it were, but it happened. Just took the right person.
 Well, I mean, have you ever even tried? Has there ever been a... Mr. Hunter? Huh?
 Ohh. There has been.
 
 Hmm. Never mind. Looks like I don't have to pretend I care.
 I'm not happy about you going against my wishes. But, I do suppose that me lecturing anyone on lecturing authority...
 In the woods, in a moderately shallow grave. You know, I got tired of digging, but it should do the trick.
 
 
 
 Here we go. Come on. Where the hell are you? Come one! Be alive. Be alive!
 Please be alive.
 Come on! Drink!
 No. Damnit!
 Breathe! Come on, Rayna! Breathe!
 Breathe! I said BREATHE!
 Thank God.
 
 You want to talk about Mr. Huntress now, huh? Turns out, I'm very interested in this particular moment.
 Well, what do you know! Vampire-human affairs are my specialty.
 
 On second thought...
 Well, if I could kill you, this would be a much fairer fight.
 
 
 
 I did. A number of times. As it turns out, she only has eight lives. The last one's the problem. Turns out that if she dies for good, everyone with that scar on your chest does, as well.
 No. But, the good news is, the Armory has her, and they're not gonna let her escape.
 
 Sorry to hear that, brother. But, I saw that coming.
 
 
 
 Nope. I'm gonna stay in one place. Desiccated, right next to her.
 
 Save a good bottle of that bourbon for me, brother. We're gonna need it to sort all this out in about sixty years.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Bon... listen to me...
 
 She's not gonna stop until you're dead.
 When's the last time you talked to your fiancée?
 Stefan's being hunted again, and it's only a matter of time before Caroline's the bait to lure him out.
 Twenty-three minutes. That's just enough time for me to get in, take out Little Miss Stabby-Pants 
 Oh, that's not good.
 Except it wasn't her idea.
 It was mine.
 It's a pretty big deal, you know? Me offering to take this scar from you? But, hey, I've been on the bench for quite a while, and you look pretty tired. So, let me tap in and give you a breather! Hashtag "you're welcome." Are hashtags still a thing? I don't know, it's been three years...
 
 Hallelujah, he's seen the light. Now, I'm just gonna loosen these love-knots a little bit, just to get his phone.
 Brother, I'm so full of werewolf toxin, I can't even feel my face. A little vervain's not gonna hurt me now.
 Don't worry about Stefan. I'm just giving him a head-start.
 Oh, you stayed to keep me company. How sweet.
 
 As soon as I charge this, I'll call him. Tell him to get his ass back here. We'll do the transfer spell.
 
 
 Oh... I'm coming...
 Hello, KQ... something, something... My vision's gone blurry. Oh...
 
 I was expecting a much cooler answer, but...
 Sorry, little fuzzy. You know, toxin fever and all.
 
 
 H-head back to the station. I'll find you a place to lead Rayna.
 
 Well, if "the great beyond" is in Dallas, then... yep.
 Me? Never better. Listen, are you still friends with those nutjobs at the Armory?
 I need to set up a meet. Stefan's got Rayna Cruz on his tail, and he needs to come in for a landing.
 I'm loving your James Bond vibe.
 There you are.
 Rayna.
 You gonna kick me in the face again?
 Now I know why Stefan digs you. You're a take-charge kind of gal.
 Oh, slightly domineering  also Stefan's type.
 Wow. Much better.
 Yeah, about that...
 
 I put a little spin on your plan.
 
 Not what I asked. How long have you known the answer? For example  my thinking was, "Hey, the transfer spell worked on Ric's babies. Maybe it'll work on the scar." Three years go by, and that little concept never crossed your mind? If I was a betting man  which I am  I would bet that you knew about the spell all along. And rather than sharing it with my brother, you lied to him.
 But you didn't tell him the truth either, did you? Because you didn't want to get rid of that scar. Because without his scar to keep him running, he could've gone back to Caroline. How insecure could you possibly be?
 By risking his life??
 I get it. You think I'm a piece of crap. And by the way, I was. Before. And then I met a girl, and she made me good. And that's why I need Elena in my life. And when I get her back in my life, I will be there for Stefan.
 Sounds more like he was everything to you. I'll take that.
 Hold tight, brother. This vintage beast only goes so fast.
 
 I needed you for backup. I didn't have time to argue. Shut up.
 We are still gonna save you. The calvary's coming to you, brother. We're gonna take down Rayna. You're gonna get your freedom, and I'm still gonna get my future.
 Relax! I have a good plan.
 Stefan, listen 
 I have a plan!
 
 
 No. No, we'll be there in ten minutes.
 I thought Stefan ran to save me from Rayna?
 
 
 Come on.
 
 Wait, why's it going away?
 
 No...
 Stefan, no! Hey. Stefan!
 Where's the damn sword? Where's the sword?
 No, this is all on me. I tried to have it all. Next time, it'll be different.
 Everything will be okay, Stefan. I'll get that stone, and we'll make this right.
 I'm gonna save you, little brother. I promise. I promise you.
 
 Hey! I'm trying to make it right, which is why we have to find Rayna and get Stefan's soul back in his body.
 We don't know that.
 I see it differently, okay? If Stefan's dead, then I'm responsible. Which means I'm going to spend the rest of eternity haunted and doing penance and seeing my own self-loathing reflected in everyone else's actual loathing. And, I'm not ready for any of those things  ergo, he's not dead. Try it my way. It's less depressing.
 You can keep being a Debbie Downer, or you can do a locator spell and help me find Rayna. What do you say?
 Where are you going?
 Really? Really?
 Valerie, I don't know why you took Stefan's body, but if anything happens to...
 ...My brother? Never mind.
 Remember anything?
 Here. Flip through that.
 It's your journal. See if anything jogs your memory.
 
 Look, the most important thing is, man  you're not in that Hell, all right? This is real.
 And look, man, the truth is, you have every right to be pissed at me, okay? I screwed up bad, and when you remember why, I do not blame you 
 Yeah?
 Okay, I think that's enough, Stefan.
 That's enough.
 Better go make a quick phone call.
 
 
 
 Work harder. I don't want to spend the rest of my life babysitting a cheap knockoff of my brother.
 
 Arkansas? What the hell's in Arkansas?
 Well, that depends on how cooperative my passenger's gonna be.
 All right, brother. Time to go.
 Yeah. Come on.
 
 I give you points for being a quick study.
 Well, fair warning, that hair requires a tremendous amount of maintenance.
 
 WAIT!
 
 And I have to rescue the real Stefan from a manhunt. You have a Heretic and a Huntress. Use them.
 Pardon me. Excuse me. Officer coming through.
 I'm a volunteer. Deputy Matt Donovan, Mystic Falls. A friend to my brothers in blue.
 
 So, what's the status?
 
 Didn't think that one through, did you, brother? What do you say we get out of here, get you back in your own body? Let's go.
 What? What's wrong?
 If it's okay with you, Captain, I'd like to question her myself.
 I need you to tell me exactly where you saw him.
 And you're sure it was north?
 Okay. All right, boys. He's south of Oden. Let's pull all troops down to that area, okay?
 
 What did you say?
 Wow. Marty's voice is, uh, huskier than I imagined.
 Sure picked a great night to get lost in the woods.
 
 
 
 Well, I guess I'm just not used to you being such a damsel in distress.
 
 
 No. No, no, I was trying to prevent myself from making mistakes, Stefan.
 
 My brother included. You mad?
 You resent me?
 Good. Then get up and come kick my ass yourself.
 Stefan...?
 Because Marty Hammond is a total train-wreck?
 Ah, don't tell me you don't appreciate the irony of this? You being human?
 Tell me, though  what's the worst part about being human? Is it... Is it leg cramps? Is it sniffles? Frostbite? What is it?
 Ooh, yeah! Yeah, that's a big one. Sucks having to play by the rules, doesn't it?
 You bring that up because you used to cheat?
 Absolutely, you did. You used to hide in Father's office, even though we weren't allowed to be in there.
 No. All the time.
 'Cause I was scared. I didn't want to break the rules.
 No. I wasn't scared I'd get caught  I was scared for you, Stefan.
 Why do you bring up hide-and-go-seek?
 Nothing. It's all very normal.
 
 So all's forgiven?
 About that... I'm afraid Marty's not gonna make it.
 Buckle up. We have less than 48 hours to track down your real body.
 Stefan? Hey, Stefan.
 Well, I pulled your ass out of the snow, you ate a bunch of doughnuts, and then puked blood all over my nice, clean car.
 You said "everything hurt," so...
 Head stuff, throat stuff, stomach stuff...
 On our way to Memphis. Valerie got a line on your real body  the one with the nice hair.
 
 Aw... Okay. Plan B.
 Don't worry, brother. I'm not taking you to a hospital  I'm bringing the hospital to us!
 I had to improvise! The over-the-counter stuff wasn't working.
 That's Frank, and that's Sully.
 I've asked them very politely to make sure that Marty stays alive, and if he doesn't, then I will cut their thumbs off and feed them to the squirrels. Right, guys?
 Meanwhile, you and I will go hunt down the sociopath that has taken residence in my brother, and then Valerie will jam his soul back... in...
 Where's my witch?
 
 
 Listen, thanks for coming all this way to help out, buddy. Means a lot.
 
 
 Get in.
 So, what'd I miss when I was gone? What's been happening?
 
 I totally would, but she didn't leave a forwarding address with my storage unit. Ah, it doesn't matter. It'll give Care-bear and I something to talk about at the reception.
 Since when do you have friends besides me?
 
 And there it goes. Look, I get you're mad, okay? I shouldn't have said goodbye in a letter. I should've flown to Dallas, and taken you out for drinks and line-dancing, and told you face-to-face. I'm very sorry, Ric. Just let me make it up to you, huh?
 One more mission, for old time's sake, huh? I can assure you that saving my little brother will be much more fun than putting together old broken-up baby dolls.
 Worked out pretty well for you, didn't it?
 
 Okay, so... I couldn't get past the threshold. You're on deck.
 Got you a disguise. Here, put that on. You can go as the... uh... creepy professor pretending to be a chaperone.
 You're not fooling anyone, Ric. You know that? You leveled a rifle on me when I showed up at your house. I know you're still in the game.
 
 Yeah?
 
 I'm answering.
 
 Huh. Well, the only parasite I'm interested in is you.
 
 ...How small?
 What about her?
 
 Consider it done.
 Well, old Marty's heart's still beating, thanks to the miracle of modern medicine. I'm now sending him to the beautiful Wildwood Motel in a big red truck. Little sirens on the top, white stripe on the side  you can't miss it.
 Hey, I'm out here busting my ass trying to catch this candy shell of a man that you love. You're the one holed up in the motel, eating vending machine crackers, so just give me a break, okay?
 So you're saying you can't do it??
 I'm not the kind of guy that likes to live in the middle, Val. You can either do it, or you can't.
 Okay. Good. Good. Now, question... Any chance you could spare some of that strength to do a locator spell for Rayna Cruz?
 Well, that doesn't look good.
 What the hell happened here?
 
 Isn't it a little embarrassing, still playing fetch for the Armory?
 Fine. Enlighten me. What are your exact needs for Rayna Cruz at this moment? Because I promise you, I need her a lot more than you do.
 We're not talking about Bonnie right now. We're talking about Stefan, who is currently dying, and the fact that Rayna is the only key to her survival 
 
 
 
 I was just about to call you...
 
 
 Hey, what happened?
 Hey!
 Uh-oh.
 No. He wouldn't know where to look. That's why he made me the hit-man.
 ...Marty drops dead with my brother still on-board?
 Oh, no... Maybe he figures he can get me off his back if he snuffs out Marty, and then I won't need Stefan's body anymore.
 Tell me you're not still driving, Frank.
 
 
 Fun's over.
 Snagged this from the front desk, in case we have to restart Marty's ticker.
 
 Don't thank me. Just promise me you can do this.
 No, no, no! Hey, get up! Hey, you promised me. Get up. You promised you could do this. Get up! Valerie, get up!
 Valerie? Valerie, get up!
 
 Hey, get up! You promised me you could do this!
 Hey, wait up!
 Ric! Ric, come on, man. Where are you going?
 Oh, Ric. I'm trying here, man. I am. I shouldn't have abandoned you. That was a terrible thing to do. I'm sorry. But just tell me whatever amends I need to make, or whatever bridges I need to build, and let's just... Let's just get back to the way things were. All right?
 Well... Thanks for being honest.
 Bonnie?
 I'm sorry. I don't... I, um... I...
 I have an idea 
 Well, this is... quaint.
 Lonely, cramped, like a prison cell. I can see why you like it.
 And miss the chance to see this den of iniquity? No.
 Oh. Cozy. It's a big step, moving in with someone.
 All right, let's do this. Where are you hiding that pesky little huntress?
 What the hell's wrong with her?
 All right, all right, Kooky-Pants.
 We're here to broker a deal.
 Yes, and Enzo's the kind of guy who'd take "No" for an answer. Me, on the other hand? I'm stubborn, I'm willful, I'm bossy. I usually get what I want. So, let me ask you this  what if you had a little help brooming out those runaway prisoners?
 A hit squad, if you will. Hmm?
 Well, me and my pal Enzo here would be happy to wipe out anyone off your list in exchange for a teensy-weensy favor.
 Oh, basically...
 ...We want you to die.
 Enzo, tell the lady why this is such an amazing trade.
 Yep. But if you don't, I'll kill the Everlasting, and you'll die anyway.
 Look, at least this way you get to be a Good Samaritan.
 Okay...
 Or, you can let us do your dirty work over the next few days, and you can die with quiet in your mind, peace, and a smile on your face. Hmm?
 
 Great! Give me the list.
 Whoa. You couldn't, uh, maybe use one of those psychic connections to conjure up a Google map or anything, huh?
 Ground control to Rayna Cruz. What's our mission?
 Oh, yeah. I know exactly where that is.
 Wow. You guys hearing this? Sorry, I'm just having a lot of difficulty wrapping my head around this new... cooperative-team-leader version of you. You've always hated us.
 Tell you what, why don't we circle back to the situation at hand. Where are you sending us next?
 I hope word of this doesn't get out.
 People already hate going to the dentist.
 His heart's not in his ankle, Bonnie.
 Well, uh, that wasn't so hard.
 Where are you?
 Gold-star guess, brother. Listen, I need some well-armed backup, any chance you can get your hands on a vamp arsenal?
 Long story. It involves Rayna and some pretty nasty phoenix stone vamps and, uh...
 I'm trying to save someone who hates me.
 Bonnie's in trouble, Stefan.
 Now, I know you don't owe me anything, but I really need the help.
 Huh! This Bonnie and Clyde and Clyde routine is starting to improve your aim.
 Enzo's a big boy. He can take care of himself.
 Look, Bonnie, had Alex seen you, she would have called in her SWAT team and all this would have been for nothing. We had to jet.
 And here I thought your new boyfriend was actually smarter than your last one.
 Yeah. Just one problem.
 Talk to me. About anything, please. I need new pictures in my head.
 
 Not as well as she's pretending to be. How's Ric holding up?
 So he's having fun?
 Lighten up. Anything's possible. I mean, look, take me and Bon-Bon, for instance. Getting better every day.
 Whoa, I got to jump, Rayna's got a bead on our nasty little runaways.
 It's go time. Let's get'er done.
 Let's get'er done!
 Beau the Heretic? Wow. Small world. Well, welcome back!
 And goodbye.
 He's on the list, Bonnie. It's not up for debate.
 Oh, come on. Really?
 Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take a walk. Get a half-caf soy 
  And by the time you get back, Old Yeller will already be taken out to the barn.
 Which part? Classic analogies?
 Or that I don't ask permission to do what needs to be done?
 What if Bleeding-Heart Bonnie doesn't want to take out the next one?
 In case you forgot, sparing Beau would've been a huge dealbreaker.
 That's what I do. I take care of things. And people. I don't give them pills that kill them and let their own stupid judgment put their lives in danger even more.
 I made a mistake.
 I desiccated because I didn't want to hurt my friends. But, I am holding you personally responsible if anything happens to Bonnie. I will hunt you down and rip your heart out of your chest.
 It's his fault, Bonnie  all of it.
 You want to hear me say I made a mistake, huh? Okay, fine. I made a mistake three years ago, Bonnie, I shouldn't have given up, I shouldn't have run away!
 Yet you still carry my letter with you.
 Well, you're not doing too well, sister. Enzo here 
 
 And what if he doesn't?
 Don't mind me, I'm just gonna go get the next name out of the job jar.
 Remember how Rayna was gonna give Bonnie her last life after we finished her hit-list? Well, the good news is she finally said yes to that deal.
 The not-as-good news is she added a few more names to the list.
 I would be happy to wipe out anyone off your list in exchange for a teensy-weensy favor.
 Well, the good news is she finally said yes to that deal. The not as good news is she added a few more vampires to the list.
 Well, then we better get moving.
 How's it going?
 Ah, good. Overachiever. Somebody taking out their aggression because Blondie left them on the front porch? (Damon gives a wily grin.)
 Still mad, huh?
 Bloodsucker from the Age of Enlightenment. Ended up in a MMA fighter. Dropping bodies all through the Palmetto State.
 Bit extreme, even for Donovan.
 Listen, you two figure out your differences while killing this MMA fighter.
 Stefan, answering your question about how to deal with being hated, three little words, Just don't care.
 I can live with Bonnie hating me, just as long as she lives. I got to go.
 Ah. Hey, Bon. How was your field trip to the nut house?
 Enzo is currently chasing down a blood enthusiast. What's wrong?
 But they don't know that.
 Listen, Bonnie, we are moving on this list, okay? If dropping bodies was an Olympic sport, we'd be on a Wheaties box. Come on, you should be used to this by now, right? I think you've died, what, three times already? Bonnie?
 Well, you're welcome.
 Nope. You are not allowed to use the 'F' word. You don't mean it. You're only saying you forgive me because you don't think that we're gonna pull this off. And look, yeah, it's gonna be tight, Bonnie. But we're gonna make it. You're gonna make it. So I don't accept your forgiveness, you understand? You are gonna have to stay strong, okay?
 Got your voicemail four times. You know, we are literally at a crossroads here. We could use a couple of bread crumbs.
 I know where you are right now. I've been there for three years. You can't drink your way out of it, you can't fight your way out of it, you can't kill your way out of it. Trust me, I tried. This isn't about you. It's not about your fears. It's not about your anger. Because if this goes bad, you're gonna have nothing but time... to drown yourself in every dark emotion your brain can conjure up. Bonnie doesn't have that luxury. So go to her.
 I'm not asking you to give up. I need to make sure that she doesn't.
 Thanks for getting back to me.
 I have a rather lengthy list of hell stone rejects that I need killed posthaste, and I hear you have the resources to do it.
 How about a key to your creepy walk-in closet?
 You finish off that list, and I'll deliver you Bonnie Bennett.
 Good news, brother. You can pack up your implements of destruction and punch your time card. Every box in Rayna's list will be checked by tonight.
 It's a little more complicated than that.
 What'd you expect? Just gonna let you die?
 What happened to the new Bonnie? The one that's not so eager to just sacrifice herself? I don't understand, Bonnie. I have a shaman ready to make you the proud new owner of Rayna's last life. All you have to do is just open the stupid vault for Alex, and you're well, you're done.
 Bonnie, stop being so dramatic. She just wants her sister back.
 You're pretty quiet on this one. I think you had a ringside seat to Mary Louise and Nora's final few days. You want to relive those good times, huh?
 And when she's dead, you'll be making them for her, like what dress she's gonna be buried in. I... geez. (phone beeps)
 I hit a little bit of a snag, Alex, but if you just...
 It's for you.
 I didn't know it took so many words to say "thank you."
 Was it selfish for me not to want my best friend to die? You bet it was.
 No, I don't want applause. But it'd sure be damn nice to hear you admit you considered making the same deal. But you knew you'd lose her. But lucky for you, you have me. Because she hates me. It's humanly impossible for her to hate me any more than she already does. So I did what you couldn't. And now she'll hate me, not you.
 What did you just do?
 Well, I can't say I'm gonna miss you, stabby-pants, but you are doing a grande solid for Bonnie. I figure that deserves a "thank you," even in my own twisted book.
 All right. Bonfire, check. Last descendant of the tribe that created you... by the way, thank you for that... check. Bonnie's O-neg, check.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, we're in a bit of a hurry here, okay? So if you can get on with the shamaning...
 Rayna.
 Rayna!
 
 Rayna screwed us. She failed to mention that by giving Bonnie her life, she was actually giving Bonnie her lifestyle. So now when Bonnie wakes up, she's gonna be Rayna 2.0. And does that gift begin with a very long nap? I didn't get a chance to ask as she burst into flames. And before you ask, no, I did not get a chance to interrogate her little shaman friend, because he vanished at the same time.
 I don't know, Enzo. I have no idea why she's not waking up. I mean, the least she could do to thank us for saving her life is just open her eyes, let us know whether or not she wants to murder us.
 What? Oh, you know her as well as I do.
 
 Ooh. Do I want to know how that went?
 I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number... Because I dialed H for "hero," clock's ticking, brother. You need to get your head in the game.
 All right, all right, I get it. You don't have any ideas, I don't either. This conversation just got really depressing.
 Convince her hunter-brain that not all vampires are selfish vicious monsters. It's exactly why I'm the worst person for the job.
 All right, Bonnie, I really need this to work. Look, I admit, I was a bit skeptical when I found out you and Enzo were a thing, okay? Well, real skeptical. But if he can't get through to you, and I'm your last lifeline, we're screwed. 
 The hell happened? 
 
 Huh, guess that's progress. Honestly, I'm surprised she went anywhere with you.
 Good call. Rinse and repeat as needed.
 Hey, doing the wrong thing for the right reason has always worked for me.
 Well, that's why we're a good team. I screw up, you wear the cape.
 Well, take it from the guy who supposedly got it all and is currently sitting with bubkes. Stop moping about who you are not and try being who you are, the guy that's in love with Caroline Forbes. You just vervained her, Stefan. In my playbook, that's a notch above flowers and chocolates, because when you love someone, sometimes you have to go to those extremes.
 
 
 You sound disappointed, hoping for someone else?
 Oh, come on, we both know why you're really here. We also know that you can't ever see Elena again. Neither can I. That's just, not until...
 Which brings us to the reason I'm here. I just wanted to say thank you, before it was too late.
 For fighting the good fight. Going gently into that good night and a whole slew of other sappy clichés. Bottom line... you're gonna die, Bon. As much as I hate to admit it, it's gonna make me a very happy man, which is why I figured the least I could do was dive into your brain and say good-bye.
 Ouch. Hurtful... and untrue. 
 
 
 Sure am, but I usually get my way.
 Sorry, Bon-Bon. 
 
 
 Come on, Bon-Bon, you know everything I've said was just a ploy to make you wake up, right?
 You can see me?
 Hey, I said what I said to save your life. It's not the first time I've saved your bacon, by the way. Don't actions speak louder than words?
 A conundrum that you're now familiar with because if you kill me, Elena will never forgive you.
 Well, you caught me. Whoa. 
 I'm not so sure you want to do that. You know, given Matt's track record, I'd say you've got about a sixty-percent chance of taking on some friendly fire.
 
 Truth is, I don't have to run from you.
 'Cause you're not gonna kill me, Bonnie.
 See the history that we have? That feeling I mean, it's almost...
 
 
 On the contrary. You're actually walking into my carefully laid trap. 
 It's not just any stump, honey.
 A memorial to one of the many lives of Bonnie Bennett.
 That you're a survivor. That you will get through this.
 No, you're not. You know why I brought you to this stupid stump? Huh? Because if I have to die, I wanted it to be here, Bonnie. In honor of you.
 I get it. The Bonnie that I knew yesterday is gone, and she may never come back. But I'm talking to you, crazy bitch Bonnie in all her glory. I still care about you. Stop.
 Look, Bonnie. Look at the stump, Bonnie. You remember it? Huh? You died. We mourned you and you came back. You've been so many things, Bonnie  A witch, a human, a ghost, a corpse. An anchor to the afterlife and now, the woman who's gonna kill me. And every time, you come back stronger. Do you know how incredible that is, Bonnie? Do you know how much I envy you? Hell, some days I can't even handle just being myself.
 I can't. Because if this is my last moment with you, Bonnie Bennett, I need you to hear me. I admire you. I believe in you. And I love you the same way Elena loved you. If you kill me right now, it's not your fault. I did this to us, but please forgive me before you do what you have to do. Okay?
 
 Hey. That was my way of saying thanks. Now that you're in charge, maybe you and I should start getting along. I've actually got a pretty good track record with the sheriffs in this town.
 Look, man, what happened with Penny...
 Help yourself, but this isn't a celebration.
 I couldn't get through to her. I would've been just another notch on her belt if Matt Donovan hadn't stepped in.
 Tell me you have a way to help her.
 Yeah, in a coffin, in a forever nap. Piece of cake. 
 Well, evil be damned. We're gonna open the place back up.
 We're gonna open the place back up.
 Nope. Which means, to absolutely no one's surprise, Donovan failed and now Bonnie's huntressing in the wild.
 I'm in Solution Land, baby. There's a preserved body at the Armory called "the final Everlasting." All we have to do is destroy that, Bonster is a monster no more.
 Look...best case scenario, we destroy it, everything goes back to normal. Worst case scenario... we all die and Stefan lives to tell the tale of our demise to the lovely Elena.
 Don't tell me what I can't do.
 I can't get in. Plan B. Stefan, call your ex. Obviously, not the one next to you. Valerie. She can siphon the seal.
 There is a third option. And let me just tell you, it is just adorable. The cutest little Plan Cs you've ever seen.
 All they have to do is walk up to the door and put their tiny little siphon hands on it...
 It's for Bonnie!
 You know these scars that we have link her to us, huh?
 She can probably hear what we're saying right now.
 Whatever, bro.
 Let me guess, It's an ancient, tentacled evil that will destroy our lives and the world as we know it.
 Do I even want to know?
 Nope.
 Unnecessary.
 It's messy.
 Small runway a few miles east of the Armory. Meet me there. Bring your cowboy boots.
 Best, no. Closest, yeah.
 Hey. Where's the pilot? Called him a few hours ago. He said he'd be here.
 Except I didn't do that.
 Yes.
 You bring that pilot back before I rip your throat out.
 More like interference. (Damon answers the call.)
 You think you're clever?
 Have you forgotten that I'm running from a hunter, Stefan? I'm trying to get out of her way.
 You have no idea what I'm up to.
 Or I'm headed to Dallas to speak to their father and talk some sense into him.
 Well, then, I will kidnap those two innocent children, because that's the right thing to do.
 She's wrong, Stefan.
 What happened to you, hmm? You and I had a breakthrough yesterday. You pulled a Damon. You made the right choice, to hell with the consequences. We actually agreed, Stefan. I sent out a press release. And then you spend one night with blonde ambition. You're right back to your old, boring, choice-matters self. What the hell, man?
 One hundred percent.
 You should put that on a greeting card.
 It wasn't about you, Stefan.
 Where are the little squirts?
 Well, for something to get out we have to be able to get in.
 Nice. Shall we?
 (Unfazed from his nonchalant attitude)...I've seen worse.
 Yup. Bad.
 Enzo says that the final Everlasting is in a coffin somewhere.
 This is appropriately creepy. Enzo said don't go in the vault.
 Yeah. Yes, I am. But I'm gonna do it alone.
 Let me do this, Stefan. There is a girl waiting outside for you, and if you go in there with me, and get all screwed up, you're gonna have problems with her, and you're gonna blame me.
 I know you can...and you have. Over and over again, you've helped me. And over and over again, it's screwed you, and so, this time, I need a different kind of help, okay? I need you... to let me go. Let me succeed or let me fail... but let me do it by myself. I'm sorry I walked out on you that night. You're right, I was scared. And I knew you'd be mad, but I also knew that you'd be okay. I know my choices suck sometimes, and you like to be there to head them off at the pass, but this time... I need you to believe in me. Okay?
 You don't want a life ruled by fear? Huh? Then, this time...you walk out on me, and don't be afraid of what'll happen. Trust I'll be okay. One way or another... I'll be okay. ... Yeah.
 Right outside... Yeah.
 There you are.
 Come on! Come on!!
 I am so forgiven.
 Wait...Enzo's still alive? Damn. I thought I waited long enough.
 Thank me in person with gifts and...
 Hang on.
 Elena?
 I can hear her in the Vault.
 What if something happened to her? What if the Armory took her?
 I just have to make sure.
 Where are you?
 Just you?
 That's very heroic of you.
 Then I should warn you...it doesn't always work out so great.
 But don't worry...it's not as bad as you think. It only hurts at first.
 Then, after that...it's kinda fun.
 Aw, did you miss me?
 It sure as hell hasn't yet. (He smiles a wild, devilish grin.)
 
 
 
 Elena? Where are you?
 
 
 First of all, let me applaud you on your quick reflexes! The way you just whipped by me... it was impressive.
 This is what is known as a slow night. I mean, I thought we'd go with the "old guy in the road" standby, and you almost got by us.
 Come on. I'll drive.
 Okay, a little backstory, because it's only fair... My friend here, Enzo, and I are the unwilling employees...
 
 
 Our job is to bring the worst of humanity, the dregs of life, and bring them here. So, between the two of you, who's worse?
 What's the worst thing you've ever done in your life?
 Try harder. What's the worst thing you've ever done in your life?
 
 
 Of course.
 This way, come on.
 Easy, my friend.
 Hey, stay calm, shh. No use in making a scene in your final moments.
 Yeah, I know. And I don't particularly want to kill you, but sometimes we have to do things we don't like.
 Don't really know.
 That's where you're wrong... I don't have a choice.
 Nah, I was just gonna read for a little while.
 Night.
 Why? She could have been dessert.
 Yeah, you should get on that.
 
 It can hear you...
 Well, there's no reason to go out of your way to aggravate it.
 No free will needed  I have flipped my switch. Humanity off. I'm on full cruise-control. I recommend it.
 
 
 Get an answer?
 Stefan.
 Hello, brother.
 Daily chores.
 
 Go home, Stefan. We're all good here.
 Surrounded by death. It's who we are, brother. It's who we've been for 160-some years. I know you think it's still worth the fight to live the illusion of your heroic life, but I'm officially done.
 Always the quick one.
 I know you can, and I don't want it. I've seen how this ends, and believe me, humanity can't save me from it.
 I'm talking about hell, brother. Not the kind of hell that traps you in a stone. Fire-and-brimstone hell. I've seen it. I met it up close. Tasted it, touched it. It's beyond its reputation.
 Okay.
 You need to go, it doesn't want you yet. Walk out of here with your hero hair intact, and never come back.
 I'm trying to explain to you, Stefan, Elena doesn't matter to me anymore.
 I ripped the switch off the wall. There is no switch, Stefan, because there is no hope. Every drop of blood I ever spilled, every body I've ever drained, every bad decision I've ever made sealed my fate. My path and Elena's path, they're not the same. Her great beyond is a decidedly happier one than mine. Now for the last time, go.
 'Til we meet again, Bon.
 Don't you two get it? You think you can win against this thing? You can't. My life is over. My life has been over for a century and a half, Stefan. Since you took it from me.
 I am a fan of the homegrown art community. You know, the wine is dreadful, but the people are nice.
 You know, I couldn't help but notice in your work that you express a certain... inner struggle. Darkness and light. A burdened brain, if you will. You really enjoy exploring themes of sin and redemption.
 True. But you should know that there is no such thing as redemption, because it only takes one bad day, one bad decision, and then it doesn't matter what you do with the rest of your life, because once the devil comes a-calling  
 Well, we don't know that he's our guy yet. It might be a misunderstanding. See, here's the thing. My friend here and I have a particularly innate sense of smell, not to mention an immense appreciation for blood, and we just couldn't help but notice that the red that you use  very liberally, I might add... Maybe a bit too on the nose  has a very familiar scent.
 Care to explain to my friend and I why you are indeed painting with human blood? And more importantly, what the hell did you do to the person you got it from? Go ahead. Whisper in his ear.
 And?
 Enzo.
 Little surprised by our family visit tonight. I thought you said we were covering our tracks.
 Well, then how the hell did they find us?
 It can get in your head. And if it knows who you care about, or who you're trying to get back to, well... you know what can happen. You may want to consider flipping your switch, because if you care for nothing, it can see nothing.
Come on, boy.
 Katherine.
 Elena. I need you. I don't know how much longer I can fight.
 What is that?
 Well, I guess she finally had enough to eat.
 Our job is to bring the worst of humanity and bring them here. What's the worst thing you've ever done in your life?
 You should be proud of me, killing bad people.
 Elena doesn't matter to me anymore.
 Because there is no hope. I'm talking about hell, brother.
 Well, I guess she finally had enough to eat.
 Huh. So what are you doing at a gun convention? If you don't mind me asking.
 Oh. Like bullets.
 What about triggers?
 And the little thingy that holds the bullets.
 And the the business end, where the bullets come out.
 Me, too. My colleague and I are in the same boat. I guess everyone answers to someone, huh?
 Is she your plus-one to this shindig?
 I'm gonna bring you to my buyer. I think she's gonna find you irresistible.
 I don't know. You're the psychic, you tell me.
 What are you talking about?
 Well, he's used to working solo; he'll come around.
 Slowest murder ever.
 So we're worried about adrenaline now.
 Well, just so you know, every other meal we've brought you was in full freak-out mode.
 Katherine.
 I'm Damon.
 About what, may I ask?
 You don't want it?
 Well, that's not true.
 You want what everybody wants.
 You want what everybody wants.
 20 questions.
 So, I'm thinking of a person. He's reasonably good-looking, charming accent, and he'd be the most amazing wingman... if he just got rid of his martyr complex.
 Got it on the second try. Why are you resisting instruction?
 Oh, yeah, you're here, but you're distracted. You're not having any fun, Enzo.
 No, I'm highly engaged, and I want you to be like me. Come on, man, we finally got a cushy assignment for once. I mean, chasing unsuspecting women that just happen to share the same name? Why can't you enjoy the change of pace?
 Easy, she has a new priority  giving you a spanking. You put her in a mood, now she wants you to flip your switch. Why'd you have to go and piss her off?
 I disagree with all of your opinions. Ah. There she is.
 Sarah Nelson. Thought that yoga class would never end.
 Why so formal, Mr. St. John?
 I was told to have fun.
 Thought I told you to leave me alone.
 Our family's dead, Stefan, you and I included.
 That's impossible.
 Talk fast...
 So the sad story of Uncle Zach's girlfriend came with a P.S. Aw, imagine all the Christmases we could've had with Sarah.
 I don't think it works that way, brother.
 You're gonna have to do a little better than that, Stefan.
 Katherine.
 I'm Damon.
 I'm Damon.
 Fight. Why?
 Would you like to get out of here?
 I'm Damon.
 I'm Damon.
 That doesn't look good.
 No, I never met her.
 Bored, actually. Just kill him.
 Well, he's a tough nut crack. 70 years in a cage'll do that to you, and you're just building up his tolerance for torture.
 Hmm?
 Sure.
 Oh, looks like little brother's getting married, huh? Consider this my RSVP.
 Bonnie? I can hear your broken little heart beating, Bonnie. Oh, poor Bon-bon. Literally always the bridesmaid. Never the bride.
 Two girls, if we're counting.
 Mm...
 Oh, see how scared you are?
 I can make it fun.
 You know I needed motivation. You need motivation.
 Couple thousand at most.
 I don't know.
 No need... I'm at the high school.
 Because I'm gonna need a favor, little brother.
 Whatever desire you have to save me, I kind of need that right now.
 No trap, elaborate or otherwise. I just need your help.
 I can't tell you. No, I mean I literally can't tell you. I can't physically make myself form the words. That's the thing about Sybil, she's not big on free will. She kind of Lo-Jacked my brain. Whenever I try and form the words to tell you what's going on, it just comes out applesauce penguin.
 Sounds suspiciously like someone's given up.
 This isn't for Bonnie.
 Well, I don't know about the "each other" part. Which is why I brought you along as a second.
 Hey, man. Nowhere in Sybil's fine print did it say anything at all about no backup. And it's not my fault you don't have any friends to stand up for you.
 I tried to be your friend, Enzo. Tried to convince you to give yourself over to Sybil.
 'Cause it's pointless, Stefan. We are in this mess because he refuses to accept that. But if he'd just sign over his pink slip to Sybil, we wouldn't be here.
 You two forget that I don't care about anything anymore. I'm just trying to stay alive. He and I both know what awaits us if we don't.
 Stefan... what are you doing? I didn't bring you here to be Switzerland.
 I brought you here because you are my brother. When that clock strikes 3 00, I'm gonna be counting on you to remember that.
 Little help over here, brother.
 Sorry, not sorry, Bon.
 What?
 No. Bonnie, don't do this to me.
 I know where I'm going when I die. You can't send me there. I'll fight every one of you.
 No. (gasps)
 You've got one last decision to make, Bonnie. It's a multiple choice. Neck snap, heart rip, or just good, old-fashioned tear your throat out?
 I wish that were the case, Stefan, but my work with her is just getting started.
 Applesauce penguin, brother.
 Listen, you're gonna be here all the time, I am gonna need to get some more pancake batter.
 Oh, yeah? What else is there to do?
 Lockwood.
 Oh, I am who I've always been. Just got to keep proving it.
 Nice hardware. Armory standard issue?
 I think we're way past that.
 That's the problem. I don't want any of it anymore.
 Is it? I wouldn't even know.
 I wish that were the case, Stefan, but my work with her is just getting started.
 What else is there to do? You still have too many attachments. Too many people willing to fight for you. We should work on that.
 Lockwood.
 Hey! Hey! Earth to Planet Redneck. Are you Peter Maxwell?
 I really need to talk to Pete.
 You know, it's hard to say. To be honest, I'm not even the one that cares about finding your boss. There is a woman... and I use that term loosely... Named Sybil, who wants to. So, inexplicably, here I am.
 Oh, you have no idea.
 Oh, I take that back. You do get me, Lou. See, the catch is  Sybil and I had a thing, but it's done. In theory, I'm a free man, but I still find myself doing whatever it is I think she'd want me to be doing. Hell, between you and me, I'd probably kill for her.
 No, you should do everything I say. Just answer one more question for me. What's the worst thing you've ever done?
 Don't move. Oh, damn. I was rooting for you, Lou. I really was.
 Now, like you said... get back to work.
 You must be Peter Maxwell.
 Damon Salvatore. AKA... the guy that barbecued your little grease monkey over there. No offense, Pete, but I don't think that extinguisher's gonna work. Lou's got a date for an eternal burn. Uh, before you make that phone call, I want you to ask yourself one question. If I just murdered your faithful manservant in cold blood, why would I have any problem murdering you? Good boy. But that was a trick question, Pete. I can't actually kill you... yet.
 You ever meet a girl named Sybil? About yay high, hot as Hell. Face rots off when she doesn't feed on human flesh?
 I'm gonna take that as a no, Pete. Then again, you could be lying to me.
 Now tell me the truth. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?
 Damn it. I'm gonna make this as simple as I can. You have something Sybil wants, I'm gonna deliver it.
 That's not an option, Pete. I don't exactly know what I'm looking for.
 We, Pete. We. Here's the deal. All I consciously know is that it's a Maxwell family heirloom. But subconsciously, I'm pretty damn sure I'll know it when I see it. Okay? So where should we start looking?
 I need you to think real hard, 'cause your life depends on it.
 Sounds promising. What kind of stuff we talking about?
 Trust me, I know the feeling, man. Where's this box, Pete?
 Oh, good. Call Junior. Get him over here. Now.
 I think it's a hood ornament, Pete. Vintage Rolls-Royce. Aah! I also think that you're in danger of losing a real life.
 Oh, are you? I compelled you to find what I needed. You keep bringing me a bunch of junk. Where'd you get that watch?
 Considering that it's a family heirloom, quite a bit... Hand it over.
 Aah! You're on vervain.
 You lied to me, Pete. And you know what happens to liars. They go straight to Hell.
 Donovan?
 Oh, come on, man, drop the act. We both know you're not gonna kill me.
 I'm sorry, Matt, I know this is supposed to scare me, but fear is an emotion, and ever since I flipped my switch, I'm kind of operating without them. All I'm getting from you is desperation.
 Look, man, in my defense, I didn't know he was your dad. I always thought you were a b*st*rd.
 Well, Tyler Lockwood is gonna be very sad to hear that. Because if you don't play along, he dies. Maybe you care about that?
 Well, that's the whole point, you idiot. Apparently, you've been out of the loop for a while, Matt, so allow me to bring you up to speed. Elena and I are through. In fact, I've been seeing another woman.
 In New York? Am I lying or being completely truthful when I tell you that I ripped into Tyler's throat last night? And then I took him on a road trip. Left him bleeding in the back of a green Mustang at the Park 'N Go off I-20, right across the border. Now, is that too specific for a lie? It's your move, Matt. Ticktock.
 Well, you can swear to God all you want. He's not the one listening.
 Hello? Little help in here. Guess it's time for plan B. The bad news... Plan B always sucks. Hello, beautiful. I've been looking all over for you. Don't ask me how I know this, or what the Hell you're supposed to do, but Sybil's gonna be very happy to see you.
 I ripped into Tyler's throat last night.
 I was wondering when you guys were gonna show up. Body's probably starting to smell a little bit. Tried to keep it as intact as I could. But I got to admit, I got a little carried away about the whole ripping-the-throat-out thing. My apologies to Donovan. I'm sure you cleaned him up real nice. What are you gonna do with that? Stake me? Go ahead, try it. But first... take your pick. 'Cause I'm gonna bury everyone of you. Easy... underestimating me is what got Tyler killed. Matt Donovan, the only living boy in Mystic Falls. You know, it's shocking you managed to stay human this long. Maybe, I should fix that.
 Not empty, brother. Don't move or I'll snap his neck. Give Matt here a non-transferrable invitation to our supernatural breakfast club.
 Sweet Caroline! How many innocent people did you kill on your no humanity bender, hmm? Doesn't matter what you say or don't. The devil knows what you did.
 What's so surprising about this? I'm who I've always been!
 Professor Ric Saltzman, everyone! Certified genius. Knows you better than you know yourself!
 You all despise me, right? Just so we're clear, hmm? I killed Tyler, you hate my guts, our ties are severed, huh? Great. If you thought there was any remaining opportunity to rescue me, let this prove you wrong.
 To be clear, we're not friends and I'm not here to set you free. In fact, I never want to see you again.
 Because I want answers. I stole that hunk of junk from Donovan's mystery dad. Burned all my bridges, made everybody hate me. I'm guessing it's because you're still in my head.
 Because none of it is for me. I can't quite understand why I have free will and yet, I'm still your errand boy. I do things to make YOU happy and I don't know why.
 What are you talking about? I killed Tyler Lockwood, of course I'm loyal!
 My friends don't care about me anymore.
 I don't feel anything anymore.
 Shut up!
 Stop talking.
 I said shut up. Shut up! What do you want from me?
 Stefan. I need your help.
 Yeah, in hindsight, that might have been a bit dramatic.
 Yeah, see, this is where it gets tricky. I want to serve her, Stefan, I mean, I have to. And serving her keeps me away from the big bad devil himself. And I want to stay away from hell as long as humanly possible.
 There are worse fates.
 You're gonna make me turn it back on. No. No, I-I-I-I-I don't want to do that, Stefan.
 Why not? Isn't this easier? There are no amends to be made, Stefan. I can't munch on bunnies and save people, and work my way back to peace. I'm hell-bound. So, why? Tell me. Knowing what I know, why would I ever want to feel again?
 Exactly, brother. What's the point?
 How?
 I-I... I can't, Stefan. I ruined everything.
 No... I can't. Is that how you help me? Vervain?
 I know exactly what I'm doing, brother. Humanity's gone dark. Anything goes now.
 You're here.
 I saw the truth. Feelings make you weak. I'm done feeling.
 I'm all yours.
 I saw the truth. Feelings make you weak. I'm all yours.
 Hey, little munchkins. Remember me?
 How do you go from island cannibal to naughty Mary Poppins?
 She isn't.
 I'm sorry, I'm missing something here. How does an evil siren scheme, centuries in the making, involve three-year-olds?
 Child sacrifice is a little hardcore, don't you think?
 Shh. Hang on. Rewind. Replacements?
 What are you doing with my phone?
 A gift of modern technology. And proof that Auntie Seline's plan needs a little tweaking.
 Here's what I don't get. Why would Cade want the wonder twins instead of you? Hmm? 'Cause their little faces don't scream Grim Reaper to me.
 They're toddlers. I could've done better in a half an hour on Craigslist.
 One minute. Promise.
 Criteria?
 Wow. All this time, I thought hell was a one-way ticket.
 Oh, great, this should be interesting.
 Because I have been with you for roughly five hours, and in that time you've almost been captured by the bumbling human authorities, not once... twice. On the plus side, I'm happy to see that there's some wiggle room in this arrangement of eternal servitude. So, let's do this. Hmm?
 Call the big man. Tell me exactly what we need to do to summon him up and then let's get to it.
 Perfect. Look at this. We have a pool, we have some residents... ah, and-and look, free HBO.
 No reason we can't get started on approvals.
 Oh, yes, you are. You know why? Because you want to get out of hell as much as I do. And with a little help, I have a way that we can all win. A plan, a good one. Get the kids out of the car seats. Let's go summon the devil.
 They're not exactly the shining stars of society.
 I'll tread lightly. Seline said you had to consent to be Cade's missionary. But that's not what your story sounds like.
 Oh, well, that's good to know. Because I have a deal of my own in mind, and I'm gonna need your help to pull it off.
 Stefan should be here by now.
 Well, were you gonna tell me?
 What did you do?
 Did you seriously siren every idiot in this rat trap to kill my brother?
 Well, the whole reason I wanted you to bring him here requires him to be alive.
 Quite the moral dilemma. What's it gonna be, brother? You gonna take the high road or the low?
 It's already done, man. Big boy's sirened to kill you, just like the rest of them. Somehow, you've managed not to kill any of 'em so far. Piece of advice, Stefan  "Kill him before he kills you." And another piece of advice  "Turn around. Now."
 Come on, Stefan. Don't be so stubborn. Kill him already.
 What's really important is why you're doing this. Want to save the twins? I can help you do that, man. But first things first.
 Ouch. That's gonna leave a mark. On your soul. Don't worry, brother. I got a get out of hell free card right here in my pocket.
 I'll be happy to take you to 'em. Just need you to agree to a few terms first.
 A little help around here? Little, little help here, huh?
 Donovan? Isn't it past your bedtime?
 Oh, your timing's hilarious, 'cause I just made the deal of a lifetime. Hopefully, a thousand lifetimes.
 How does an evil siren scheme, involve three-year-olds?
 Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, Ric.
 Yeah, he and Matt took a whack at me. They even buried me. I can't tell you how hard it was to get all of that dirt out. I know. I know. Christmas just got merry.
 Well, you already poisoned the bourbon with milk and cinnamon, so...
 You don't have to hide them. I'm honoring the deal. We work for Cade. Munchkins go unharmed.
 Stefan, why don't you come with me and we'll go get some of the old family tree ornaments, huh? Oh, come on, Stef. I'll tell you why I'm here. (Stefan sighs and relents to follow Damon.)
 My murder, Stefan. They actually buried me in a shallow grave, not even in the family plot.
 Thanks to our eternal agreement with Cade.
 I'm getting ornaments for the tree, Stefan.
 You know, Saltzman going all crazy on me did have an unexpected benefit.
 I got to hang out with the new head honcho.
 The one and only. He's an interesting guy. You want time with him?
 Funny thing... (Damon plunges a wooden Christmas ornament into Stefan’s heart)... he said the opposite about you.
 Relax. He's not dead. Have you seen Ric? Because if that's what's holding up dinner...
 I killed him. I mean, technically, he is dead. But he'll be back. Your baby daddy staked me and I don't have a scratch. Same dealio. Big man requested a meeting. What was I gonna do? You know... I bet... that if you just wash this off... it might still work.
 Which is a hell of a lot more than he can say for you, Peter Maxwell.
 Anyway... I'm sure you're all asking yourselves why I barged in tonight. Relax. I come bearing a gift. Now, unfortunately, I'm only gonna be able to give it to the most despicably evil person in the room, and that's gonna be a tough decision. But tonight, one lucky little elf is gonna get an all-expense paid, one-way trip, straight to hell. Meaning, I'm gonna kill one of you. Let's eat.
 It's really quite simple. I assess the evil in people, so if they are wicked, immoral, corrupt, foul, nefarious, et cetera, I kill them.
 Hey, where the hell is Ric? What was he, reading the dictionary to those girls?
 What? Was just breaking some bread.
 Look who's talking about murder.
 Oh, yeah? Your old flame Penny is pretty dead as a door...
 You know, at least Ric looked a little torn up when that stake went in my heart. And you looked pretty psyched. But I forgive you, Matty. You've had a lot of tragedy in your life. Here's the deal. Ric was just doing the parental thing, much like what he's doing upstairs right now. Do I want to kill him? Yes, but that's personal. This should be principle.
 Or what?
 Well, look who decided to join us. I was just asking Peter what's the worst thing he's ever done.
 You left your son. You abandoned your family. And your answer to the question what's the worst thing you've ever done is...  "Uh, I guess I gambled and cheated on account of my dishonesty."
 Well, unless your last name is Pan, you haven't been a kid for a long time. So, explain to me the last 20-plus years.
 Yes you do. And quick. Next cut goes a couple inches lower. What are you gonna do, Donovan? Kill me again? Let's hear Papa's story while he still has some vocal cords. Last chance. What kept you away for more than 20 years?
 Wow. It's worse than I thought. He didn't have a reason at all. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner.
 I wouldn't.
 How's your head?
 Good.
 Mm, must be the holidays.
 Hop in.
 Three's a crowd.
 You're gonna want to get under the hood and flip that humanity switch, Stefan. Won't be so painful.
 Suit yourself, Ebenezer. The Salvatore brothers, back on the road again. We need a theme song or something.
 There he is. Merry Christmas, brother. Merry Christmas.
 You left your son. You abandoned your family.
 You're gonna want to get under the hood and flip that humanity switch, Stefan. Won't be so painful.
 Hi. I'm Damon. And I have anger issues.
 Well, I got my brother this job...
 Yeah. Through my connections. Anyway, our boss gave Stefan new orders. And now, we're supposed to push people to make evil choices, and only then do we kill them and send their souls to the devil.
 Oh, they're all compelled. Clarity over cleverness. That's what I always say.
 Anyway, since he got this new job, he's been difficult. Full of himself.
 Small potatoes. I don't even think they make the cut.
 Uh! Elizabeth. Quiet. You too, Meg.
 Whoa.
 Whoa. What if we threw in everybody? Choose between yourself and these people.
 Yeah. Me, too.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I thought we were only giving Cade the worst of the worst, like this guy.
 What are you doing? Meditating?
 That's a very fine line. Or a very fine neck membrane.
 I'm just saying, you have a Ripper history. Are you sure you want to keep testing the blood-soaked waters?
 Well, I can see that.
 That rich lady? Nah. If we sent people to Cade just for being bad tippers, there'd be no room left in hell.
 We just did anger. Besides, judging by the pool of candidates we have here, she's probably the only one that already worships the devil. She's hardly a challenge, Stefan.
 The old woman? Spilling stuff everywhere? What are we doing, mercy killings?
 Well, how do you know she's a doctor and not some orderly?
 I don't know, Stefan. Maybe she had a brother that bored the crap out of her?
 Not everybody 's a big ball of angst like you. Maybe she's driven by something good.
 Oh, really? Sounds like some winnin' words to me.
 Vervain? Come on, man. Don't you trust me to play along with your attempt to corrupt the good doctor?
 All I've heard is sad, Stefan. I haven't heard dark. Maybe your spidey-sense is wrong about her, pal.
 Really?
 Stack the deck, why don't you?
 I told you she'd be a challenge. Hmm.
 All I'm saying is maybe some people can't be corrupted. Maybe she's just plain good.
 You'll see. Hey, what are you doing?
 What? No.
 Can you stop cheating for just one second?
 Mmm...
 Tara, listen to me.
 Please. Come closer. Please. Look at me. I was never... a drunk driver.
 Mm. Tara. Show him I'm right about you. Give me a chance to redeem myself.
 My life is worth something.
 Uh...
 Tara... I'm sorry. Did you hear me? I... Tara... It's... I... I'm sorry for what I did.
 Uh... no... I wish I could go back and change it, but I can't. I'm so sorry for all that I've done. No, listen to me. Killing me won't change the past.
 Oh... No. Don't do it, Tara.
 Oh, Stefan...
 Technically, you're not wrong.
 Oh, fortunately, I got a little pick-me-up from an orderly that came to get my body. Thanks for nothing, by the way.
 You really think Cade's gonna want her, man? She's not even evil.
 Maybe she deserves a second chance.
 Well, that's your resting state, Stefan, so what?
 So what? It's a re-gift from Caroline. I forgot I even had it.
 Yeah, my emotions.
 No, it's not. Well if that's true, then... I think she's ready to meet the boss.
 Thanks.
 What are you talking about?
 I told you it doesn't mean anything to me.
 Why not?
 Oh, my God, you are so full of crap.
 I don't.
 Fine. Fine.
 Psst.
 You find anything valuable around here?
 Well, that doesn't help my existential crisis. I was driving through here last night with my brother. We got into a heated moment and threw something out the window.
 Oh, he took the morning off from work. Besides, he doesn't want me to have this thing, anyway. Honestly, I don't even know why I want it. 'Cause whenever I have it, I just feel... better.
 He can be. You got any siblings?
 Lucky you. Never have to worry about other people's mistakes.
 He's keeping it together. Relatively speaking. Which is a good thing... 'cause things are weird right now. My brother takes a turn for the worse, all bets are off.
 By doing penance, like you? One wrapper at a time?
 You have something Sybil wants. I'm gonna deliver it.
 I don't.
 If my brother takes a turn for the worse, all bets are off.
 What'd he do?
 I have a drink, thanks.
 Oh, yeah? And your standards are dropping. You can't tell me Cade gets out of bed for a midlife crisis on a motorcycle.
 The evil lackey you are trying to reach is no longer at your service.
 Oh, you know, different city every night. Salvatore brothers world tour.
 Yeah. So?
 Um... I'm on my way.
 I know, but every time I try and tell her no, my mouth says "yes."
 It is?
 I'm not here to dance.
 No. I think you meant to say, "Yes, Sybil, whatever your heart and beautiful face and body desire."
 I think what I meant to say was... no.
 Elena?
 You're right. That is exactly what I need to do.
 I have no idea what you're talking about. But I hope it hurt.
 That's a good question. Sybil called me back here. She wants that ball of iron I've been lugging around. For the first time, I was actually able to tell her no. Because of this.
 Absolutely not. I don't want Sybil dead until she fixes what's going on inside of my head! I don't know what's happening to me, but so far, this thing has been nothing but trouble. Why did you give me this?
 Yeah, I know that. Why does it mean anything to me? I hold it and I get this... little flicker of warmth. And then... it's gone.
 After I flipped my switch, Sybil tinkered in my head. I don't know what it was, but she did something to guarantee that all my feelings for Elena went away.
 And of course you want to believe that. Because if you didn't, you'd be forced to admit to yourself that you and Stefan are through.
 He is ripping again, Caroline. And this time, it's guilt-free.
 I'm ready to get out of here.
 Why do you care?
 If this has something to do with me not pulling my weight with Cade, I think you're killing enough for the both of us.
 What are you talking about?
 It's not my fault you fell off the wagon.
 That's old news, Stefan. I don't care about Elena.
 I haven't been myself lately, either.
 What are you doing?
 Yeah, I'm aware of that.
 How is a stupid pageant supposed to remind me of feelings attached to something I haven't even forgotten?
 Does this have something to do with that stupid metal ball?
 Or murder you for squatting in my mind.
 I'm not afraid to face my humanity.
 You and I will be over. Forever.
 You gotta stop that right now. I can't take any more of this.
 I hid the striker upstairs.
 One last thing. When you were mucking about in my subconscious, did you ever take the time to understand Elena? Hmm? Her capacity for forgiveness?
 Oh, I do. I remember all of it. And even though I can't feel a damn thing for Elena, the more you try and push her out, the more I understand she's never going away. And there's not enough room in my head for both of you.
 What?
 What are you talking about? I just fought Sybil. I won. Isn't that the whole reason we came here in the first place was to get this woman out of my head?
 Oh. Now you have a problem with Elena, who's not even here?
 Let me get this straight. I've been dealing with you for weeks now, covering your tracks, laying in a hospital bed so you can get your kicks, and now you're ditching me?
 You're choosing her over your own brother?
 Ah... back from the dead. How's Cade? Any words of wisdom for his disgraced ex-servant?
 Well, that's not gonna be for a long time. And if you think you can siren yourself out of here thanks to whatever you did to my brain so many months ago? That's gone, too.
 Oh, maybe I'll just get in your head, make your life a living hell.
 That's not true at all. I know you spent your life forgotten and abandoned. Feared and hated. Hell, anyone who loved you had to be sirened to do so. I mean, except your sister. But now even your sibling doesn't want anything to do with you. Take it from me. I know how that one stings. But I know why, after 2,000 years, you have nothing. Because you are nothing. Nothing but a spiteful, insecure, unlovable little girl. Don't forget. I've seen you. The real you. Pool-of-blood you. Aw. I made a siren cry. What's my prize? Well, I guess I'll take a few centuries of torture.
 I wrote you a letter.
 Hello, brother.
 You know, you probably shouldn't be wandering around here all alone. There's a killer vampire on the loose in my head.
 You must not have gotten the memo. You see, Bonnie helped me work through my issues. And you have the reason for your visit backwards.
 You're not here to forgive me, Stefan. You're here so that I can forgive you.
 You're right. I'm a monster. But, like I said, I forgive you.
 Then why are you here, Stefan? Huh? Why are you always there to straighten me out when I go off the rails? C'mon man, you're not here for Cade. You're here because you blame yourself for turning me in the first place. Apparently I still do too. At least until today. I officially forgive you.
 I forgive you Stefan.
 Remember that vampire I was warning you about, running around in my head? Well, it's not me. It's you. It's always been you, Stefan. So, for the last time I forgive you for making me what I am. I absolve you of all the death and destruction I have caused as a result. And you wanna know why? Because you're my brother. And I love you and there's nothing you can do to ever change that.
 What the hell you talking about?
 You're right, little brother. I can't forgive you for destroying our home town. Cos I ain't gonna let it happen.
 Let's hope that one doesn't count.
 How you feeling, sport?
 Hashtag you're welcome. Your dad was looking kinda rough, too. I put the Hell Bell in the back of his truck and sent him on his way. You're not gonna do something stupid like chase after him, are you?
 Hey. Matt! I'm sorry about Vicki. I know you'll never forgive me for what I did. I should've told you this a long time ago.
 Yeah. It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
 Does that mean we're good?
 Fair enough. Need a lift?
 Always did like the sheriffs in this town.
 Hey.
 Looks like I'm interrupting a reflective moment.
 Wish I could say the same thing.
 "Dear Bonnie. I'm a coward. I should be saying this to your face, not writing this letter but I know if I do, you'll talk me out of running away from all my problems. You're gonna make me face the future without Elena and you're gonna help make me the best man I can possibly be, same way she did. And I'm absolutely terrified of failing you both. So I'm leaving, because I'd rather let you down once than let you down for the rest of your life. And I hope it's the happiest life because you, Bonnie Bennett, are an amazing woman, a mediocre crossword puzzle player and my best friend. With great love and respect, Damon."
 I'm so sorry I left. It won't happen again.
 I ain't gonna let it happen.
 Update from the outside world.
 But I do. I care so much, it hurts. But it's a good kind of hurt. Because my lovely humanity is back on and I am seeing the world through rose-colored glasses.
 Don't hold your breath, brother. Psycho sisters are MIA. It's almost as if all is right with the world.
 Stefan Salvatore, dropping bodies is not part of a balanced, humanity-on lifestyle.
 That's okay. I forgive you. I'm all about redemption these days. I am gonna set things right.
 She had other obligations today. Contrary to your personal belief, it's not all about you. You look hungry. I'm gonna make pancakes.
 Second chances, coming up. I dare you to have one of these and tell me that they are not the best pancakes you ever...had.
 Where the hell is my brother?
 Noted. What brings you to town?
 Don't think I want to know what you did to motivate Stefan.
 Here's the thing. I don't really feel like being your Terminator anymore.
 Quality? Like the queen of England quality?
 Oh. Well, she's a bit of a no-fly zone. You know what I mean?
 Well, there's no point now. Cade's in town. He set our boy free.
 He also told me to kill you.
 Of course I have a plan B, Blondie.
 I don't know. Wherever he is, he's not answering his phone.
 Points for optimism.
 Mm-hmm.
 You mean his realm of pain and fire? No. That's just his vacation home. He's here to stay.
 Of course it does. This may come as a surprise to you, but you're not the only optimist in town. Well, let's get these yahoos somewhere safe. Stay clear, yourself. Cade gave me till sundown to kill a hundred of these people or kill you instead, and I don't want to be tempted by either.
 Less you know, the better. We're up against a mind reader who's also a pyromaniac. But I'm sure it'll all be fine.
 I am busy. Just staying out of trouble.
 Yeah, but I'm on the redemption jag. See, there's this girl I want to impress. So I'm trying not to kill anyone. Ever again.
 I just want to renegotiate our deal. You throw in the Caroline, and the whole 'by sundown' of it all into the mix, you really changed the rules.
 Nope. I just think you're being you.
 Question answered.
 Plan B didn't work. We need a plan C.
 Well, apparently the devil can't be killed. At least not if you rip his heart out. Or set him on fire.
 When did I ever promise that? Listen, in my defense, he did both of those things to himself. Bastard's tougher than he looks. Guess after 4,000 years, he's learned a trick or two.
 Mm-hmm.
 How?
 No. No, no, no, no. The cure is off the table. I'm not risking my future with Elena.
 You're talking about the devil here.
 You realize if you take the cure out of Elena's body, that little vial is our one and only dose. And we're not even sure it'll work on Cade.
 No, it's what YOU want. You know what I want? I want to fix my brother, I want to get rid of the devil, and I want my future with Elena. But I am not becoming human while she sleeps for decades.
 Before or after they stole it from me?
 How can you be so sure?
 No, I don't. Bonnie's not gonna like this.
 Just hear me out, okay? Cade as an immortal, disturbingly indestructible. Cade as a mortal, total question mark. Therefore, if we give Cade the cure, thus turning him mortal, it might be the only shot that we have to get rid of him.
 If you have better ideas about how to defeat the devil, Bonnie, I'm all ears.
 But there's more at stake here than just you or me or Enzo.
 Well, at least I'm asking. You were just gonna give Enzo the cure without telling me.
 You know what I want us to both be? Alive. But we're all out of options.
 This is the loophole. I hate it, too, Bonnie. I hate that this is all my fault, but I got us into this mess, and I'm gonna get us out. 
 Is that a 'Yes, I'm with you. We'll take down Cade together'?
 You said I had until sundown.. micromanager.
 It's not up to Stefan.
 What do you mean, 'his' choice?
 Okay... fine. 
 Happy?
 And then you send Stefan home?
 No. No, no, no. No, no, no. I'll do anything you want... You stop him!
 Sorry, Blondie. You'll only slow me down if I have to hurt him.
 Donovan called in some favors. NYPD's headed to the warehouse right now.
 What... how is that even possible?
 Where Bonnie hid her? How would you even know that?
 Stefan... listen to me.
 Then, whatever anger  you're working through, man, you can just take it out on me.
 Stefan.
 What?!
 You don't have to take care of me... ever again. I got this. I'm good. I'll take care of both of us, Stefan.
 I swear to God, Stefan, if you hurt her... you are dead to me.
 This is not the answer, man. Leave Elena out of this. I am begging you, Stefan.
 Stefan.
 You can't do that. You won't.
 Stefan. 
 Bonnie, hey. Bonnie! 
 Well, those aren't tears of joy, Bon. What is wrong?
 What?
 Listen to me, Bonnie. I am on my way, okay?
 Not until I know you're safe. I'll deal with Stefan.
 What do you mean?
 He hasn't come back.
 Okay. That's good.
 One where Stefan's human. His emotions are back. The memories of every drop of blood he's ever spilled are gonna be doing a square dance in his head. It's best he's not alone with all this right now. I'll meet you there. You talk to Bonnie?
 Sure you do. Think about it. Can you blame her? I'll call you when I'm close.
 I doubt that, seeing you're the reason Enzo's dead.
 Well, if you're making house calls, I'm guessing it's not that easy.
 And the fact that you're waiting tells me you want something more than Stefan.
 That what you want? Hmm? A dusty old book?
 I need to borrow a book, the Maxwell family tell-all. I'm guessing it's been out of print for a while.
 Convenient. And yes.
 Haven't been able to sleep lately, and I thought that would do the trick. What's it to you?
 All right. I got about six hours and change until Cade takes Stefan's life, unless I give him that book.
 I don't know. But if it saves my brother's life, I don't care.
 I'm sorry, too, old buddy. But Stefan's in this mess because of me. So you're gonna have to kill me, again, if you want to stop me.
 Yeah, the clock is ticking on Stefan’s life, but by all means, let's give Donovan a physical.
 Oh, yeah? How's your little science experiment gonna do that, huh? We're gonna trigger MATT's visions by inducing a hypnotic state. If we're lucky, the answer's in his head.
 That'd be a first.
 Or we'll just dive right in.
 Come on! Cut to the chase! Where's the smoking gun in this story, huh? Why is the journal so important?
 Hey! Give him my blood. 
 Story of my life. How do I know you're gonna keep up your end?
 Just between us bad guys... has anyone ever... earned their way out? Hmm.
 How's it feel to be a mere mortal?
 I heard they pumped you full of three pints of blood. I hope you saved me some.
 Well, why don't you take a seat. I poured you a painkiller-friendly drink, and I'll sit with you and remind you how badly you always wanted to be human.
 What'd you come up with?
 Well, you'd be surprised. Bonnie’s a much better person than you or me. I'm not saying it won't take time. Clock doesn't start ticking until you say the words.
  No, that... that's no big deal. I do that 'cause it's Tuesday.
 Yeah. I've got some undoing of my own to do. Do you think that there's a chance for us? For redemption? Absolutely. Get to it.
 Yeah. I saved my brother, Ric. No apologies. He's human, and if I'm lucky, I have about 80 something years to make peace with the fact that he's gonna die one day. All I could do was make sure that day wasn't today.
 Because... say it with me, Ric... I'm selfish.
 I'm gonna take a shot and say that it was an instruction manual to kill Cade.
 Yup. Because I know how it ends. Come on. Grab your blindfold and your headphones.
 Sybil sure loved to hear herself talk. But... in all that blathering, she did mention that she had an insurance policy against Cade. I'm betting this is it.
 60/40. But a relic of Cade's creation, that is the means to destroy him? Now, that has a certain poetry to it. Ah. Admit it. I did pretty good. Now... 
 Bonnie's a much better person than you or me.
 A relic of Cade's creation that is the means to destroy him? Now that has a certain poetry to it. I say we make a plan to kill the devil.
 If you want my forgiveness, you're gonna bring Elena Gilbert back to life.
 Now this is creepy.
 Oh, speak of the Devil. The Devil. What the Hell is going on?
 Well, that makes sense. Kai siphoned me like a juicebox. Why are you here?
 Well you're out of luck cos I don't have it. And last time I checked I wasn't your errand boy any more. What happens if I refuse to play fetch.
 Go for it. I'd rather burn than serve you for another second.
 Careful, brother. I can hear you popping a hernia over here. Need a hand?
 I didn't know you planning a trip.
 Cade has Elena, Stefan.
 Long story. Cliff notes  I had a nasty run-in with our old friend Kai Parker. Didn't end well.
 Ish. He's alive enough to screw me over and kidnap Elena's coffin.
 Apparently. But Kai being Kai tried to cheat the Devil. Kept an ace up his sleeve and now Cade wants that too.
 Putting aside the fact that you were gonna blow out of town without having an epic bro moment, I hope wherever you're going can wait. Cos I, I need you help, brother.
 Sorry, I went to put in a song.
 Sorry. This place had the nearest holding cell. Little help?
 So, you just opted to help me with this homicidal lunatic instead of spending a moment with your fiance. Care to elaborate?
 Sorry, Blondie. Probably safer if you don't get involved.
 Hmm, well in his tiny human brain I'm sure he thinks he's protecting you. He doesn't believe he's worthy of someone like you, Caroline.
 Beats me. He doesn't wear the cape or carry the pitchforks, maybe this is just his way of being dramatic. Things have a way of getting bloody with Cade. We may not have another chance, so you wanna tell me why you were planning on leaving town?
 Then, it's a good thing Caroline did.
 I don't think she agrees, bro.
 Well, if that's the way you see it, what're you doing out here with me? I've always been the albatross around your neck.
 That wasn't the plan, man.
 Yeah, I know. I was there, I was eavesdropping. You actually believe him?
 Are you forgetting that you are human? Kai almost gutted you and I was standing right there. What do you think Cade's gonna do?
 It's suicide, Stefan. And if you screw this up we don't know what he'll do to Elena.
 Yeah, I'm sorry too. I can't let anything happen to her. Or you.
 We had a deal, Cade.
 So what, you got what you wanted. Now it's time to pony up.
 No.
 Screw you.
 No. I can't. I'm not saying the words.
 I choose me. Stefan's mortal, he's lived a supremely messed up life, his soul's already damned. Take me. You'll get us both eventually.
 Well act now because it's a one-time offer.
 My soul, in eternal anguish. Twisted, black and delicious, just the way you like them. So come on, eat me.
 Sorry, Stefan. It's been a hell of a ride. Put my girl out first and promise me you'll keep your grubby hands off her soul. Permanently. 
 See you in Hell, Cade.
 I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride, little brother.
 If Cade's not running hell, who is?
 Katherine.
 Except Vicki's dead.
 Sorry. Can't let you do that.
 She went splat.
 You are aware that she's already dead.
 Don't "Damon" me. In fact, don't say anything at all. Katherine Pierce just declared war, and I need a clear head.
 Relax. Just testing a theory. Wait for it.
 Yep, she's deader than a doornail.
 You need to convince her to stop ringing this bell. You understand me? Fate of Mystic Falls lies with you and your family, so get on it.
 Anticipating your failure, so it's kind of dumb to stick around. I have things to do.
 The only chance we've got is if Donovan can somehow convince his train wreck of a sister hell ain't so bad.
 Nope. Katherine won. She played the long game and finally beat us. 
 Elena.
 Bonnie's okay. You're both okay.
 You're awake. 
 Where's Elena?
 Damn it, Katherine. Where is she?
 Well, that shut her up.
 The boiler room? There is a horror movie reference in there somewhere, but it escapes me.
 I'm all over it.
 You're like a bad penny.
 I'm sorry.
 After 153 odd years, this banter that we have is just old. So, why don't we just skip to the part where you tell me what you want and we'll negotiate.
 You know, petty doesn't look good on a woman your age, Katherine.
 No, you're jealous of Elena. Because you know that Stefan and I both would choose her over you every time.
 What makes you so sure of that?
 I figured you'd keep showing up to annoy me. You're nothing, if not utterly predictable.
 Well, I figured now that you're practically the devil, you'd be in the know. I just hung out with Bonnie Bennett and she figured out a way to save the day.
 She's done it once or twice, my money's on her.
 If you take the highway round the mountain, sure, but as the crow flies it's only seven miles, which is the beauty of these tunnels. Did you know that they go from The Armory straight into the heart of downtown Mystic Falls? I bet you didn't know that, did you?
 Even better. I think she can send it straight back to hell, where you and I will be waiting patiently for it. I've gotta say, I look forward to dying by your side, KP.
 I've got this handled, bro. You need to get out of these tunnels.
 Bad time to be a martyr, Stefan.
 Fine. Then we'll both go.
 I'm aware, Stefan. Tell Elena that I did this for her, to pay for my past mistakes.
 I'm not gonna leave you to die here, Stefan.
 Are you seriously gonna sit here and argue with me about who needs this redemption more? You're not responsible for Enzo, Stefan!
 Then I'm accountable too and I've spilled even more.
 Which means a lot less without you.
 No.
 No.
 I love you, little brother.
 Then you're right. You are human. Which is why I can do this. 
 You walk out of these tunnels and you are not going to stop until my death breaks the compulsion, because I am the big brother. I'm sorry I wasn't better at it until now. I said go. GO!
 Poof.
 Not long now, demon spawn. I can hear that fire coming back this way.
 You have no idea.
 
 You'll see him again. Me, I'm going the other way. They'll probably reopen hell for me.
 Hello, brother.
