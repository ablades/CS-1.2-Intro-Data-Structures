 Elena. Oh, my god.
 How are you? Oh, it's so good to see you. How is she? Is she good?
 Really?
 Oh, you poor thing.
 Oh! Okay, see you guys later?
 His name is Stefan Salvatore. He lives with uncle up at the old Salvatore Boarding House. He hasn't lived here since he was a kid. Military family, so they moved around a lot. He's a Gemini, and his favorite color is blue.
 Oh, please, I got all that between third and fourth period. We're planning a June wedding.
 So, you were born in Mystic Falls?
 So, Stefan, if you're new, then you don't know about the party tomorrow.
 Hey! You made it!
 Well, let's get you a drink.
 Oh, come on.
 Hey! There you are. Have you been down to the falls yet? Because they are really cool at night. And I can show you...if you want.
 Well, of course I have. So—
 No.
 Why didn't he go for me? You know, how come the guys that I want never want me?
 I'm inappropriate. I always say the wrong thing. And...Elena always says the right thing. She doesn't even try! And he just picks her. And she's always the one that everyone picks, for everything. And I try so hard, and...I'm never the one.
 Yeah, it is.
 I'm confused. Are you psychic or clairvoyant?
 Yeah, well, feel free to conjure up the name and number of that guy from last night.
 I don't know. I was drunk.
 Yeah, and then you poured Grams another shot and she told you about the aliens. So then what
 You and Stefan talked all night? There was no sloppy first kiss or touchy feely of any kind?
 Not even a handshake? I mean, Elena, we are your friends. Ok? You are supposed to share the smut.
 OK, what is with the blockage? Just jump his bones already! Ok, it's easy. Boy likes girl, girl likes boy, sex!
 Hey, I got some candles.
 You slept with Vicki Donovan? I mean, Vicki Donovan slept with you?
 Ugh, it's just so much drama. Ever notice how the druggies are the biggest attention whores?
 Yeah, she kind of wigs out. It's like her thing.
 Oh...whoa.
 No, it's fine. Um...I was hoping I'd see you again.
 Cocky much?
 Aah!
 Please...Don't!
 No! No! No! Get away from me! No!
 Aaah!!!!!!
 I got the other brother. Hope you don't mind. Sorry I'm late, girls. I, uh, was busy. All right, let's start with the double pike herkey hurdler, what do you say? And 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Elena, sweetie, why don't you just observe today? Ok? Keep going! Ok. Do it again from the top. And 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
 Surprise! Bonnie said you were doing dinner, so we brought dessert.
 Get in here.
 I cannot believe that Mr. Tanner let you on the team. Tyler must be seething. But good for you. Go for it.
 Yeah, Elena wasn't so lucky today. It's only because you missed summer camp. God, I don't know how you're ever going to learn the routines.
 I guess we can put her in the back.
 Oh, it's just 'cause her parents died. Yeah, I mean, she's just totally going through a blah phase. She used to be way more fun. And I say that with complete sensitivity.
 Matt tries, but he's just having a really hard time. You have to understand that they were each other's first. You know, like, from the sandbox.
 Mm. Thank you, it's new.
 Oh, I can't.
 Um...All I know is that I can't take it off.
 Does it look like I do dishes?
 Hmm...I don't think so.
 You know what? I'm gonna go see if Elena needs some help in the kitchen.
 And you're not in uniform because...
 Hey, Tiki, it's all wobbly. Can you stand straight, please? Could someone please help Tiki?
 I don't like the blue.
 You cannot be my date. My mother is going to be there, and she is a very proud gun owner.
 You should come to the founder's party with me.
 You gotta read the first book first. It won't make sense if you don't.
 How come you don't sparkle?
 Yeah, but you go in the sun.
 Will these bites turn me into a vampire?
 You can be very sweet when you want to be.
 Are you going to kill me?
 Why not?
 Anything.
 Oh, I'm excellent.
 Go with Elena.
 Okay, go by yourself.
 And I'm supposed to care why?
 Older sexy danger guy? Is that an official witch twitter tweet?
 Okay. And Damon's not dangerous. You know, he just has a lot of issues with his brother. You know, like major, deep-rooted drama.
 I'm not really supposed to say anything.
 Okay. But you can't tell Elena.
 Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood. This is my boyfriend Damon.
 Wait here.
 Really, you couldn't even change out of the badge for this?
 Just some guy.
 Oh, 'cause otherwise you'd approve. Yeah, I doubt that.
 Memphis.
 With Steven.
 Well, I'm bored. I want to dance. And Damon won't dance with me.
 Could I just borrow your date?
 You wouldn't mind, would you, Elena?
 Well sorry, but I'm not going to take no for an answer.
 Now why would he do that?
 Okay, just tell me if you see my mom.
 They look so cute together.
 Where have you been?
 Your brother barely danced with me for five minutes—
 Um, you're not supposed to touch. What is that?
 Well, how did you know that it was there?
 When?
 Well, what's it for?
 Well, you can't just steal it.
 Well...
 Hey. So how are things with Stefan?
 Really? Well, my radar must be off, 'cause I was getting all sorts of other vibes...
 Hmm? Don't!
 Nothing, okay?!
 No, okay, nothing. It just...My mom would kill me.
 No! Of course not! Just leave me alone. Okay, Elena?!
 Don't! She took it off and I got flustered, okay?! I didn't know what to say. But I swear, okay? I did not tell her. I just told her that you didn't mean to hurt me.
 I swear I didn't say—
 Yeah. I'm fine.
 I'm fine.
 I'm fine!
 I remember the party. Damon came up behind me, and he was kissing my neck, or biting my neck. I passed out. It's like there's holes in my memory lately. It's just weird. Maybe I let him bite me.
 Can we just not talk about it, ok? Don't want to talk about Damon. I don't want to talk about any of it. Just want to go back to normal. What are you doing with that candle?
 Damon gave it to me. Or he was going to give it to me. All I know is, it's mine now.
 Well, get your grubby hands off it.
 The sexy suds car wash is tomorrow. The football team and the band have committed. Well, not all the band. Just the ones who could pull off the bikini. I want, in your face, sexy. I mean, it's a fund raiser, for god's sake.
 Stefan, where is Damon? He has some serious apologizing to do.
 When is he coming back?
 I know that.
 No, Tiki, do not do the one-piece, ok? I've seen it on you. Trust me. Yeah, but you're going for stripper pole vibe this year.
 Yeah, maybe we should wash the cars in slow motion. No.
 What? oh, um, no, sorry. Um, so I'll just see you tomorrow. Two-piece. Ok, bye.
 Shoo, shoo! Shoo! God!
 No friend discounts. No freebies. No pay ya laters. We are not running a charity here. No, we are not.
 The event is called sexy suds, you know.
 I'll go get some more. Mind the money.
 Damon? Damon? Damon? Oh, my god! What is this? How did I know that you were here?
 You bit me.
 Why do I keep remembering the same things, but in different ways?
 What am I about to do?
 Left early.
 Mom, if I want to talk boys, I'll call dad. At least he's successfully dating one.
 It's nothing!
 I have got your costume. It's all here.
 Come on. Can someone please be excited that it's Halloween? I just wanna have fun, you know, just some silly, fluffy, Damon free fun.
 Yep. Wear it. Toss it. I don't care. I just want it gone. Hey, have you seen Elena? Do we know what she's wearing?
 Riding to his castle on his white horse.
 Lightweight. I am going to drink until someone is hot enough to make out with.
 Look dungeon boy I'm done being your little slave girl. You seriously hurt me, and I will be damned if you think.. 
 Oh, why don't you do it?
 And why am I having this party?
 But Bonnie has it.
 Amazing party right?
 Well, are you having a good time?
 No.
 Bonnie I've been looking for you. I'm totally sorry to do this I know it's so Indian giver and I know we're not even supposed to say that anymore but I need my crystal back.
 Then I saw it on you and I realize how great it is, and I've got three outfits I can coordinate it with so....
 Well, I didn't want to tell you this but I'm your friend, when you wear it makes you look fat. There I said it, but it's because I'm your friend so...
 What do you mean you can't? Bonnie it's mine.
 It is.
 No. Maybe, just...
 Argh!
 Bonnie won't give it to me.
 I tried. It shocked me.
 Why are you being like this? I'm so good to you and I'd do anything. It's just some stupid necklace.
 Don't talk to me.
 What is there to explain Bonnie? You got what you wanted...and something that doesn't even belong to you by the way and, I get called a shallow, useless waste of space.
 Who do you think?
 As opposed to how my best friend treats me. 
 I slim -I'm slipped. I slipped.
 Well...a very nice but not handsome bartender was very kind to me tonight. Unlike the rest of the global universe. Are those curly fries?
 Baddest. Am I shallow?
 I don't mean to be. I wanna be deep. I wanna be, like...the abyss deep.
 That's true. I'm shallow, I am worst than shallow, I'm a kiddie pool!
 Can I just go home okay?
 Like you care.
 As a skunk.
 Can't wait. 
 No. Do you ever feel like there's not a person in the world that loves you?
 I just wish...
 Wish that life was...different.
 Please....don't leave me alone.
 No, I'm mad at her. She needs to make the first move.
 Impossible in her presence.
 She's a thief, that's why. I gave her my necklace, and she refuses to give it back. It's a matter of principle.
 Good. Your turn. Where's Stefan? Have you talked to him?
 Why?
 Bye.
 Hey.
 
 The "hey!" That's twice. That is two heys. That do you have any other words in your vocabulary?
 It reeks of awkward subtext. You spent the night in my bed! There was cuddling! And then, you snuck out before dawn so you wouldn't have to face me, which I must say is a total Lame-Guy move that I did not appreciate. And now with the "hey"s? Seriously? I mean, I may have been some pathetic, insecure mess after the party, but do not mistake that for me being a pushover, because I do not let guys mess with my head anymore.
 You went out the window? Another Lame-Guy move.
 
 
 You could have just given it back to me.
 Screw Damon. Are we doing manicures or what? Who has their kit?
 
 
 
 
 
 What is going on? Why am I not a part of this conversation? You guys do this to me all the time.
 That's not true.
 And don't we all know it?
 I listen. When do I not listen?
 Bonnie. Look, it's just not me. I don't believe in the...
 Come on. Let's summon some spirits. This Emily chick has some serious explaining to do.
 Be quiet and concentrate. Close your eyes. Now take a deep breath. Bonnie. Call to her.
 Really? "Emily, you there?" That's all you got? Come on.
 Yeah, it just happened.
 Ask her to show you a sign. Ask her. Emily, if you're among us, show us another sign.
 What? Well, I didn't take it. What? What happened?
 Bonnie!
 Bonnie! Bonnie! Unlock the door!
 Unbelievable. You were totally faking it.
 No! You scared the hell out of me.
 I can't believe I fell for it.
 She's leaving. I'm leaving.
 I can. I've had enough freaky fake witch stuff for one night.
 What's happening?
 I'm outta here.
 
 Not funny.
 About?
 It creeped you out? I mean, did you just come over here to insult me or what? Because it's been a really long night 
 
 Well, thank you, 'cause I love being a charity case. You can leave now.
 Well, I was awake for that part.
 Those always make me cry!
 I sat through Family Guy. 
 So what do I do now?
 Can you hurry? I have things to do.
 So, why did you need me to do this?
 Can I go now? This has blown, like, half of my day.
 
 Following my future. 
 Yes. Broadcast journalism. 
 Bonnie, where are you? I’m ready to go. I’ll be outside.
 
 Well, I was supposed to go home with Bonnie, but I can’t find her.
 Okay.
 You know, this is fate.
 Because I’m interested in broadcast journalism. So can I ask you a couple questions?
 Ok.
 It's so pretty. Thank you. God, it'll go with, like, everything. What's the occasion?
 Lesbian friend necklace? Cause we're freaky like that?
 Why are you being so mushy?
 I was gonna talk to you about that. I was, but there's just not much to say. You know, we've hung out a couple times. That's it, but...I just feel like we've peeked as friends. 
 But it's all about you. Matt's not over you, and we all know it.
 
 Well, I do that, too, but if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. You know, I just like that we're hanging out. Who knew—you and me?
 So what are you wearing to this dumb dance, anyway? Should we color-coordinate?
 Why not?
 Since when are you a busboy?
 
 No, but this took about two hours, so I'm at least staying half of that.
 So what is this, like, a threesome now, you and the Salvatore brothers?
 Mmm. I'll help.
 Back off, Damon.
 Be a little more obvious, Bonnie.
 What? It's just a drizzle. Ben McKittrick? Really?
 He's a washed-up jock who pours drinks for a living. You could do way better.
 Hey.
 Tonight was so much better on paper.
 Yeah, this coming from the girl who's been eye stalking the bartender.
 Seriously?
 Do you see anyone else in the vicinity?
 Are you mad at me or something?
 Well, then why are you being so weird?
 You're avoiding.
 Look I said something stupid. I'm sorry, but I wasn't even talking about you.
 That's not true. Are you seriously mad about this? Matt, you know me. Ok, I say stupid things without thinking, and then I have to apologize and take it back, and...I'm a terrible, awful person, but I'm working on it.
 Ok. When do you get off?
 How do you know that? Have you even asked me?
 Well, big problem, Matt, because you took the next step all by yourself, and you played the whole thing out in your head, and you decided to bail before even giving it a shot. So this really great thing that we have, don't worry about losing it, 'cause it's already gone.
 
 Hey, Jeremy. Where is Elena? I've been texting her and Bonnie all day about Duke's party.
 
 Some guy that graduated a couple of years ago. And he throws a party every time he comes home from Duke.
 His real name's Bob or something. 
 No, seriously. Everyone goes. Even quiet loner little brothers. 
 Hey!
 So, I have a speech. It is fully scripted and well-rehearsed. Are you ready for it?
 Yes. It's a "You kissed me and I don't want things to be weird" speech. It's preemptive.
 Yeah, you know, in case you were having second thoughts or regrets, or were, like, ooged out-
 Can I just get on with the speech part?
 So I know that you don't think that this is going to work out between us. I just want to let you know that right here and right now, I'm offering you an out. Like an escape clause.
 I don't wanna make assumptions about what it is we're doing here.
 So, if you would like to exercise it, just let me know.
 Okay. Good.
 So, see you for Duke's tonight.
 Elena! Oh my God, where have you been?
 I wasn't talking to you.
 Hey! There you are.
 So...
 I have another speech.
 The hand thing, with Elena, it was lame. Well, I was lame. And, hey, your feelings for Elena aside, Damon was there, and he was always such a jerk to me. And I wanted to show off that I was with a good guy. So, anyway, I was lame. So, forgiven?
 Is what for real?
 Speech number three? I want this to work. And I'm scared that you're gonna change your mind and you're not gonna want it. I don't want to mess it up.
 This is boring. I'm bored.
 But we have this entire house to ourselves. I mean, it's practically a bachelor pad.
 So shouldn't we do something a little bit more bachelor-paddy?
 Something like that.
 Seriously?
 He's already been hit on, like, 35 times. He's total cougar bait.
 Hi, Mrs. Donovan.
 Congratulations, Mrs. Donovan.
 Okay.
 Hi Mrs. Donovan.
 Yeah.
 Hey.
 Good.
 With your mom and a six pack?
 Oh...I'm sorry. It's hard for me to show kindness to people that hate me. I'm not that evolved.
 So, a movie tonight?
 OK.
 I'm thinking nothing huge, just a dinner at the grill maybe a late movie.
 Two pair out on a Friday night coupled. Yeah a double date.
 Why not? We all haven't gone out together before and I don't want it to be uncomfortable for us. Look the couple dynamics have changed and there's been a little awkwardness between you, Matt, and me and I just think it's important that we get over it.
 Ok. So, we will see you tonight.
 At least they're having fun.
 I'm gonna go to the restroom. Elena?
 So um, what are you doing?
 Well the point of this was to show him how much you care about Stefan. You know, not to hopscotch down memory lane.
 Try less.
 Elena, come on!
 This is much better than watching Damon visit cougar town. No offence.
 Feel like I've been here before. It's weird.
 Why would you keep a car that doesn't run?
 I don't like sports cars; they're too hard to make out in.
 I don't want to talk about it.
 And insecure and stupid. But that doesn't change the fact that Matt's always gonna be in love with you and I'm always gonna be the back up.
 Yes I'm. I'm Matt's Elena back up; I'm your Bonnie back up.
 You don't get it. Why would you? You're everyone's first choice.
 Uh...No, I think it's up there.
 I don't know. You were reminiscing about the Elena years the whole night so...
 I know that okay? I know.
 No, no. I think you're doing just fine.
 Sports cars...
 Damon?!
 It's fine, just go.
 Bye Stefan.
 Maybe she needed to hear it.
 Well, you can't control your mom, Matt, any more than you can control your sister.
 Maybe she'll surprise you. People have a tendency to do that. I should go before the roads get even worse from the storm.
 I have to. It's my dad's boyfriend's daughter's birthday. We have a non-traditional traditional ritual.
 Got it. Anything else?
 Bye.
 Storm washed out Route 5. Now I'm detoured on some random backwoods path to hell.
 I know, right? I need one of those little bluetooth thingies.
 Okay.
 God. Ohh. Ohh. Seriously?
 Aah! Aah!
 I made you some coffee.
 Are you...is there anything I can do?
 Bonnie! Bonnie! Thank god you're home!
 I know we talked everyday but I missed you.
 How are you doing?
 Well, I can help with that. Major wardrobe problem. You need to help me pick up the perfect dress for the Founders' court.
 The Founders' court! You know, Miss Mystic Falls. They announced it today and you and I are both on it.
 So, are you dropping out then?
 No?
 I'm on the Mystic Falls beautification committee; I volunteer at the poor soup kitchen.
 I implemented this year's go green campaign at school.
 I worked for the recycling program and was in charge of this year's police raffle.
 The Fell cousins don't have a shot and Amber Bradley is only on the court so the pageant doesn't look like its founding families only—which of course it is. So that leaves Elena which totally has the sympathy vote since her parents died. How can I compete with that?
 Oh I'm sorry, this must sound really unimportant. In light of everything.
 Well, my grandmother was Miss Mystic and both of my aunts. My mom is the only one who didn't get the gene and I want this. I actually deserve this.
 I begged Bonnie to fill in for Matt, he had to work today.
 Nope, just my boring fill in escort.
 They wouldn't let him out of work. Wait, what happened to Stefan?
 What do you mean?
 No, no, no way, no. You had your chance to drop out and believe me I was all for it because there is no way that I could beat you. Elena, you're doing this because it was important to your mom.
 Where is Amber?
 I actually won!
 Let's reference last years Miss Mystic float.
 This is what they did last year and this is exactly what we don't want to do.
 Southern classic elegance.
 How'd you know?
 So true!
 Where's Elena? She's supposed to be helping.
 Okay, what's the deal?
 Don't play dumb. You and Elena are fighting. Spill!
 It's not nothing. You know this whole float is supposed to be about friends creating something together and everyone is fighting. Matt and Tyler hate each other, you and Elena are on the outs and I don't like it! And I can't fix it if I don't know what's wrong.
 The ambulance is saying in 15-20 minutes.
 I didn't drive.
 You will not wait okay?! You need to see a doctor, Tyler is driving. End of story.
 Go!
 So you're not going to tell me what happened?
 To who?
 What are you talking about?
 Yes!
 I want one with Bonnie now.
 You made out with his mother and then you beat him to a pulp. You're gonna have to do a little bit better than sorry.
 There was this time, freshman year, when Bonnie and I were in a fight and we swore that we would never talk again.
 Mayor, is everything okay?
 What's the matter?
 Tyler! Tyler!
 I'm fine, I'm fine.
 No, I'm fine, I'm fine. They're helping Tyler.
 Jersey Shore's on.
 Careful, still a little sore.
 Its okay but they say I'm healing really quick.
 Oh, isn't he cute? Why are you crying?
 Oh, I love you guys!
 Elena?
 What are you doing here?
 What are you talking about? What message?
 What?
 Excuse me? Where is everyone?
 It is? Oh, uh...have you seen my mom?
 She did? Yeah, she did but she said her name was Katherine. Can I just get something to eat?
 But I'm hungry.
 What is that smell?
 I don't know.
 It's gross.
 Morning? I need to get out tonight.
 I'm not neurotic.
 Look, it's not about the carnival okay? It's just that this place is just really depressing.
 No don't!
 Just close it, please?
 Close it!
 Yeah, my friend gave it to me.
 You can't tell anyone, you can't tell anyone! (She compels her.)
 You'll do what I say?
 Good, because I'm starving. (She bites her.)
 The doctor said I'm good as new. He signed me out. He said that I didn't have to wait 'til morning, so call me when you get this.
 It's dark, thank god. I'm so sorry about that.
 Okay, now what's the story?
 Yes, good. Okay, so I'm gonna take off. I'm the committee chair for the carnival and I'm worried it's a complete disaster. I mean god bless Elena, she does not understand the word fabulous. Once again I'm so sorry about that and if you could just forget that I bit you that would be great because I'm going to...
 I don't know how that works but it's brilliant. (She leaves.)
 I remember.
 I remember how you manipulated me, you pushed me around, abused me, erased my memories, fed on me.
 Memories have been coming back, in pieces.
 I have a message from Katherine, she said "Game on".
 You suck. (She leaves.)
 They discharged me. All better!
 I feel pretty good.
 I'm all better. All better!
 Yeah!
 They must already have already been broken.
 Oh no.
 I got to go. (She leaves and he follows her.)
 Just leave me alone! (She leaves.)
 I'm so sorry.
 He's dead. I killed him. What's wrong with me? (She cries.)
 You can?
 What are you gonna do?
 Please don't! I don't want to die!
 No! I'm not. Don't say that, okay? Just help me!
 Okay? Just help me please! Please, please!
 Get away from me! You killed me!
 No! Then why did she look like you?! And why, why did she do this to me?!
 Bonnie?
 Bonnie...
 She hates me! Bonnie hates me.
 And what about Matt? (She cries.)
 I'm a murderer. I'm a monster.
 Why does this keeping happening to my face?!
 Why did Katherine do this to me?
 What are you doing here?
 You know you should just go 'cause my mom is gonna be home soon.
 What do you mean?
 So, I don't get to choose the ring I have to wear the rest of my life?
 Now what?
 I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
 Bonnie, you're supposed to be my friend.
 Do you really think I meant to kill that guy at the carnival?
 So that's it? I mean nothing witchy happened. You know, no flickering lights, no gust of wind. Have you even done this before?
 What? I just want to make sure that it worked.
 What if it hadn't Bonnie?!
 So what I do when I see the rabbit?
 Isn't killing cute defenseless animals the first step in becoming a serial killer?
 No I am. Look, I swear that I am okay? But it's just...I haven't been in the sun for days and everyone is at the swimming hole having fun and Matt is there! And he finally told me that he loved me but I have been blowing him off and now you want me to eat bunnies and I'm kind of freaking out okay?!
 And now you're laughing at me.
 What?!
 What do you mean?
 So you're saying that now I'm basically an insecure, neurotic control freak...on crack?
 Really?
 Okay.
 Why are you looking at him with your serious vampire look?
 Hum hum. I mean it's different from your worried vampire look, neither of which stray too far from your "hey-it's-Tuesday" look.
 I mean I was not gonna say it like that but...
 Matt.
 I know, I got held up but I'm here now.
 Go find somebody single to stalk, Aimee.
 She was flirting with you.
 You're mad?
 Yeah, she deserved it.
 You know, why is everyone sticking up for Aimee freaking Bradley?
 Oh, so now I have magnified jealousy issues, too. That's great.
 Yeah, well, I might as well have stayed dead. My entire personality is killing me.
 Shut up.
 He's mad at me.
 Still mad?
 Nothing. Nothing. I don't need anything else. I'm sorry Matt, I'm so sorry. I'm so, so, so, so, sorry.
 No, no more drama. Just...I promise.
 For what?
 What happened?
 Oh my god.
 What was that?
 Wait! What is it?!
 You're not going to remember what I did to you or what you saw me become.
 And then an animal attacked you and bit your neck.
 What are we gonna do about Tyler?
 I can't believe I hurt him.
 He is the one person on this entire planet that I never wanted to hurt.
 I shouldn't be with him, should I? Because if there is any danger...
 You ever think you should have?
 Seriously Aimee?
 Oh, that's what you call it?
 No, I'm not Matt. She's into you and anyone can see it.
 This isn't my fault Matt, okay? She's after you and I shouldn't have to put up with that.
 Well, I lied.
 So what, are you like breaking up with me?
 Elena?
 Katherine.
 Is that Stefan?
 I'm sure he's fine.
 God! I cannot stop eating. Stefan says it's a great way to sublimate the cravings. It's horrible just fighting the urge for blood every minute of every day.
 Yeah and he hates that you're a constant temptation.
 The desire to rip out your jugular every time he's with you? Trust me, it's there. It's why I had to break up with Matt.
 Finally, I'm starving.
 Puppy! Puppy with a tutu!
 You want to leave?
 I don't think that's a good idea, Elena.
 Take it from me, there's nothing worse than a clingy girlfriend.
 How about I drive you?
 Here we come, to the rescue.
 That's my own drama. I'm sure that you two will beat the odds. Not that there is any study to pull odds from. What is the ratio of success for vampire-human couplings? I'm guessing nil.
 Sorry.
 Whats playing?
 Ta-da!
 Oh crap.
 I know, it's weird. They said they'd be here by now.
 No! Just let me try the tow people again. And I'll use my agro voice.
 I can't just leave my car.
 Just give me a minute, Elena.
 What's the rush? Why are you hurrying to get to a relationship that will never work?
 I'm not projecting anything! You're human, he's a vampire. You're gonna be 70 and in diapers and he's still gonna be smoking hot and you will never have his children, Elena! And you are too maternal to not have children!
 I'm just trying to be your friend.
 No, Elena, don't!
 Don't leave me alone.
 Katherine.
 I tried okay? But I couldn't exactly kidnap my best friend.
 I told her that her relationship was doomed and all that mortality stuff. I think...I really think that I got to her.
 Elena.
 Oh my god. I am so sorry about earlier today. I don't know what came over me.
 So...you're not mad at me?
 My own head case, horrible way. Elena, I really am sorry.
 Are you off today?
 I know. I just assumed you'd bale.
 You're gonna pretend to be a mother?
 Well be warned, I'm in a mood.
 Elena wasn't...yes um...Elena was here. She just needed to talk. Her and Stefan are going through a rough patch.
 I'm fine.
 I'm not different, I'm fine.
 You know there's pretending to be a mother and then there's reality. Let's not push our luck, okay?
 So suddenly, she's in the running for Mother of the Year just when I'm trying to avoid her the most. I'm babbling, you don't want to hear all this.
 Well, I was a bitch which is par for the course with us. So, how are things with you and Stefan? Anything?
 You said that Katherine's dangerous. Maybe he's got a point.
 Just what?
 Oh, oh. Longing looks are being exchanged.
 No, Elena. I think it's a bad idea.
 Don't worry about it.
 Don't worry about it.
 You okay?
 You know, maybe it's for the best.
 No, I'm not. I'm not being a good friend at all.
 Is she leaving? Where is my mom going?
 What's wrong?
 You mean work? You've surprised me. You last longer than 5 minutes.
 It always is.
 I don't know. Something's up.
 I need to be able to hear better.
 Something's wrong, Elena.
 Shh.
 Oh god.
 Stefan and Damon.
 They've been here.
 I can take you.
 Yeah. I do.
 I told you.
 Come on.
 My mom. She's killing them.
 No, no, no, no!
 No, I can't. Elena, she's gonna find out about me. Elena!
 Hi mom.
 Damon's right you know. If there's ever time to break your diet...
 You won't tell anyone, will you? Mom? Mom? Please. Look, I know that we don't get along and that you hate me but I'm your daughter and you'll do this for me, right? Mom, please. He will kill you.
 No!
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
 Hey, sorry that took forever. I just didn't know how long my mom was gonna be here.
 Hey! You get some bunny in you?
 I can't go home.
 Because I'm scared.
 Katherine's gonna be there and she's gonna want me to tell her everything that happened today. She told me I had to spy on you and report back to her.
 Matt, she threatened Matt and I'm so scared of her Elena! I am so scared of her.
 Why is she doing this? What does she want?
 You didn't eat much. Good news  Doctor Damon said the vervain is almost out of your system. So with any luck, you'll be freshly compelled and back in your own bed by tonight.
 Are you really just gonna pretend like I don't exist?
 As usual, you don't care. Got it. Just like before I was a vampire. It's not like I died or anything.
 Yes and no.
 So, I mainly drink from blood bags. It's not as good as the fresh stuff but it beats the animal blood that Stefan's been trying to get me to drink.
 Damon does. I've been pilfering his supply, so...
 I want to. It's my basic nature now. But, on a healthy diet, I can control it. I'm getting better at it. I'm better than Stefan. He's a bit of a problem drinker. A blood-aholic.
 I know. But when life gives you lemons...
 Damon's home.
 Hey!
 I'm gonna take her home tonight.
 Did you find the moonstone thing?
 Yeah.
 On the edge of the old Lockwood property. Why?
 Well, I can come with you.
 Okay.
 Elena!
 I got you, okay?
 I heard Elena screaming. Help her, now!
 Are you ready?
 Sorry!
 Elena, what's going on down there?
 Elena? Ready for you!
 Hurry!
 Elena! What's going on?!
 So I pulled Stefan out of this well and he's all vervained and just rotted, but Bonnie wasn't mean to me once and I just - I really think it's progress, you know? I just...what? I'm freaking you out.
 Don't. Don't. We...We're just starting to get along...
 Oh. Thank you.
 We never talk like this. Ever. And today meant so much to me.
 I know.
 I know I can trust you, but you're never going to trust them.
 I'm going to take you home. You're going to forget that I'm a vampire.
 You'll remember you got sick with the flu. You had a fever, chills and ickiness, but I made you soup and it was really salty. We bickered. You got better and then your selfish little daughter, who loves you no matter what, went right back to ignoring you and all is right in the world.
 I'm still shaking.
 I saw Katherine today.
 At the Grill. I just stopped by to gawk and...quasi-stalk Matt.
 No, I'm not staying. I just needed to use the little girls' room.
 Then I had to pretend to use the bathroom even though I didn't really have to go because I'm a doofus.
 Elena?
 Yeah, you know...whatever.
 I know Elena is...I know Elena's at home.
 Can we just give her the moonstone so she'll leave?
 Hey, come on in.
 I won't. Look, she killed me. Fair's fair. As long as there's no werewolf running around.
 What do you mean?
 I don't know...nothing.
 I...
 Wait, no, no, no! Okay. They're trying to kill you.
 Bonnie has it.
 I don't know.
 Okay. She's upstairs, she's upstairs!
 Why do you keep dragging me into this? I don't want any part of it.
 It's that one.
 I did it! I really didn't think that I'd be able to fool you but I did it!
 Goodbye Katherine.
 What is going on? Stop!
 Matt?
 Tyler, look out!
 Tyler? Tyler?! Tyler, what's happening?
 What's happening?!
 Matt and I were fighting, we broke up you know, and Sarah was drunk and dancing and she just tripped. And then she wasn't breathing.
 Matt's in the car, sleeping it off. I'll deal with him; I don't want him involved in any of this.
 I'm fixing a very bad situation.
 No, you didn't mean to and I think it's best for everyone...
 Actually, Tyler, I think I do.
 Has your wound healed?
 So Sarah attacks Tyler and he pushed her away and she tripped and she fell and she hit her head.
 Hmm, he thinks he blacked out but I think they were both compelled by Katherine. That's why I covered for Tyler and said it was an accident.
 Gee, duh. Tyler getting blamed for Sarah death just opens up questions that he can't answer and do you really think that it's a good idea for him to tell his mom he's a werewolf?
 And that werewolf road leads straight to Vampire Boulevard! I thought I was thinking fast on my feet.
 Leading the search party for Aimee Bradley. They haven't found her body yet.
 They were more gold with amber highlights.
 Can he turn into a wolf now?
 Nothing, really. I don't think he knows much of anything. He seemed really freaked out and honestly, I felt kind of bad for him.
 Alright, I'll ask him.
 I understand. I'm late for school.
 Hey! How are you doing?
 How's your mom? My mom said that she was pretty freaked out about everything that happened with Sarah.
 What do you mean?
 Know what? That you were upset? I thought I was doing a good thing by covering for you.
 Look, it was an accident? Okay? And I've got to run just...please don't blame yourself.
 Hey. Um...are you okay?
 Look, Tyler...I think that you misunderstood me at the party. I get it, it was very traumatic.
 Nope but I'm late.
 Please, that was nothing.
 I'm sorry, Tyler but I think that you're still in shock over Sarah dying and it's understandable.
 Mom?
 What are you doing here?
 Breaking and entering the sheriff's house? That move will win you an award.
 No.
 Tyler...
 What?
 I'm not lying!
 I'm not a werewolf, okay?
 You know, this sounds crazy but alcohol helps or at least it helps me. You know, with all that inside jittery stuff.
 Really? I never had any of that. I guess wolves are different. At the beginning, I was very, very emotional. Everything was heightened.
 How can you be a werewolf?
 Just me. It's a really long story we can share another time. How many other werewolves are there?
 Look, Tyler...You can't tell anyone, okay? Not about you, not about me. No one will understand.
 I want to tell you about my mom and yours and the founding families and the council but I need you to promise me no one will find out about us. This is life and death, Tyler.
 Tyler...No....I...
 I can't believe I'm agreeing to this. I'm a terrible liar.
 I'm even worse at duplicity and you know this.
 Yeah, because she threatened me. Not that I'm saying that you should use that as a tactic, it's...Stefan's gonna see right through me.
 You had to break out the girlfriend code. Okay. I promise.
 Why don't you want Stefan to know?
 Are you sure you want to do this?
 But you're asking for the truth from someone who's probably never giving it. Are you sure about this?
 Stefan!
 Hey. Uh, I need to talk to you. Where are you going?
 Ditch her.
 You know what? Of course you are. Go ahead, I'd...you know what? We can talk later.
 I might have done something.
 Told Tyler I'm a vampire.
 Sorry to drag you here but if I don't eat, I get those kill innocent people urges. Tyler totally has those too by the way.
 Not much. I was trying to keep the questions to a minimum. Are you mad?
 But you're not gonna tell him, are you?
 Always looking out for me.
 Then why do you do it? Why are you such a good friend to me?
 I...you have a friend?
 No I just...sorry. I just...tell me about her.
 Wait! No! What do we do about Tyler? I don't want Damon to kill him ‘cause there's a full moon coming up and Tyler is totally freaking out about it.
 Wait...!
 What do you mean?
 I can't tell you.
 I'm sorry but I...I can't tell you.
 She's not in any danger. I would not have let her put herself in danger.
 Ew, no!
 Stefan, I am your friend but I'm also Elena's friend and I'm sorry but I'm not going to tell you where she is.
 Matt.
 How are you?
 Okay.
 Looks like it. You realize there's almost a full moon?
 Have you even thought about it? The whole...wolf thing? Do you know what you're gonna do?
 Well...?
 I'm student council vice president, head of the prom committee, not to mention I single-handedly organized this town's clean up campaign. And you're really gonna turn down my help?
 I know. It's better this way.
 You do?
 I know.
 I know that this is the old Lockwood property.
 Did Mason tell you about this place?
 Whoa. They look old.
 What's this?
 Was it Mason's?
 Well, does he say what happened?
 Um...There's nothing. 
 "I chose the garage. I could deadbolt the door. It was far from the street so no one could hear. I bolted hooks to the floor for the carabiners". 
 It's....wolfsbane. 
 "I kept thinking I'd black out and not feel it. But I did. I...I felt all of it".
 How long is it?
 You know what? I don't think we should read this anymore.
 There's a...a reason it's called a "curse", Tyler.
 But...he did say that the transformation speeds up over time.
 So, if you can just get through this first time, then...
 What do you mean?
 That's not true. I've known you my entire life, Tyler. I-
 I don't know. You just seem like you...like you kind of need it.
 I was alone when I turned. I had no control over my body or my...urges. And...I killed somebody. I don't want that to happen to you. I don't want you to be alone.
 I gotta...
 Matt.
 What are you doing here?
 Well, are you okay? I-I've been worried about you.
 Matt, I...
 Hey. What's wrong?
 Yeah.
 Maybe he just stopped to go surf somewhere. Isn't that Mason's whole thing?
 I'm sure he's okay.
 Tell me you brought the instruction manual.
 Yes. Not an easy herb to find. This is it.
 Is that more than a werewolf can pull?
 
 Oh my god, you're not gonna get naked, are you?
 Almost eight. What time does the moon crest or whatever?
 Does it say how long you'll actually be a wolf?
 Are you sure you want to do that?
 Tyler...
 Shhh...
 Hey. Tyler. Tyler.
 I know. Just breathe through this, okay?
 Not yet.
 I want to help but I don't know what to do.
 No!
 No! No.
 It's okay. You'll fight through it, okay?
 No.
 No, not yet.
 I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere.
 Tyler?
 Tyler.
 You're okay. You made it. You didn't get out. You're okay.
 How are you feeling?
 You did it. You know, you...your first full moon and you didn't hurt anyone. It'll get easier. You'll get better at it, you'll learn to control it and it won't hurt so much.
 No but small victories, Tyler. Last night was a victory. You know, let's take it.
 Yeah, anyway, uh...next month we should probably reinforce the wall because you almost got me that one time and it just would have been, um...
 Never mind, it's...
 Well, it's not a big thing, it's just that one bite and it's...you know, curtains for me.
 The legend says that a bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire.
 I...I think I read it somewhere...
 Yeah, sure.
 That was nothing, okay? There is nothing going on between Tyler and I, we were just talking...
 Well, good.
 Oh, okay.
 You can't.
 That's just...
 No Matt, okay?
 Why what?
 I know, I was there.
 You caught me off guard.
 What did you except me to do?
 Well, I'm sorry.
 And what? What do you want me to say, Matt?
 Okay, I feel...like I....I love you.
 At school. What's up? What's going on?
 Why? What's wrong with you?
 What?
 Because you needed help.
 But you didn't.
 Why is it so hard for you to let someone else help you?
 Yeah it is, Tyler. It's like you don't want anyone to care about you and I'm sorry I care. I care Tyler so forgive me if I overstepped my boundaries by actually giving in...
 You can't do that.
 Everyone just need to stop kissing me!
 Hey. How's it going?
 Yeah, we do. Listen...I've been thinking about it, and I don't want to over analyze. It was just one kiss, but Matt's still kind of in the picture. We can't go there, Tyler.
 Great. That's settled.
 What?
 I...I don't...
 Who told you that?
 Let me explain.
 Please...
 I'm sorry, Tyler. I'm sorry.
 Tyler knows about you and Damon. He knows that Damon killed Mason. I didn't say a word.
 Tyler was so upset. The look on his face, he was so betrayed.
 You're not gonna tell Damon, are you?
 Well, we're not gonna let that happen. We have to get to him and reason with him before he does something stupid. You have to talk to him. Just try to explain, you know? You always know the right things to say, okay? He and I...we're friends.
 Hey.
 I'm not avoiding you, I swear.
 Okay, maybe a little.
 Yeah, yeah, I'd really like that. I'll just swing by when you're closing?
 Okay, bye.
 Yeah.
 No, not since earlier. Sorry.
 Really? How? Is that one of your little wolf tricks?
 Well, I have a trick too.
 Why are you doing this to me?! Why are you doing this? Why?
 Let me out!
 Let me out!
 Tyler, there's a latch on the door and I can't get to it.
 Tyler?
 Tyler, please! Tyler?
 What's happening?
 No, she's at work.
 I'm fine, Stefan.
 I'm okay. I'm not girly little Caroline anymore. I can handle myself.
 I just really want to go shower so...
 Good night.
 Hi.
 Oh my...I'm so sorry Matt.
 Yeah. Something came up with Bonnie and she needed me, a friend thing. You understand?
 Yeah. so I'm not gonna make it tonight, but can I see you tomorrow?
 I'm fine.
 Do you know what they did to me?
 I lied to protect my friends. I lied to protect you. Don't you get that?
 You just stood there when they were going to kill us. You just stood there! You didn't do anything!
 You help your friend, that's what you do.
 No, it's too late, because we're not friends anymore. And what happened to me tonight, that will never happen again. So, you take that back to your little werewolf pack, and you get the hell out of my house!
 Hey.
 What's going on?
 I'm fine.
 Go away!
 Elena!
 Okay. So tell me about this big, witchy plan you've been cooking up.
 No, we don't.
 And he's not gonna tell you anything.
 Uh, I don't know. I thought that we were...I don't know.
 Hi.
 Yeah, I can see that, but can you work and talk?
 Uh, I want to talk about what we were supposed to talk about last night before I had to cancel on you. I want us to clear up the weirdness. I just want us to talk about us.
 Uh, I...I don't know what's going on, Matt.
 I...
 Oh.
 Matt!
 You stay away from me.
 Just stop it, Tyler, okay? You're just...you're just making it worse.
 I said just leave me alone.
 What are you doing here?
 She's selling it and he's buying it. She's giving him the sex smile.
 We only have, like, an hour or two before my mom gets home, and these are all I could find.
 I'll get the matches.
 
 
 So...What, you'd rather be with traitor warlock over here?
 And you've known Jeremy since forever, and you only see him one way, as Elena's brother, but you're a witch, and I'm a vampire. You know, it's not like we're in any position...
 
 How long is this gonna take?
 After the sacrifice?
 Mom?
 Hey, Matt.
 Live band?
 Aren't we all?
 Not a peep. You?
 He stopped by to see you? What did he say?
 And that's all he said?
 Yeah! I...I mean, no, I...it's just not that easy.
 No, you're right, and I'm sorry.
 Chinese food or pizza?
 I will get it.
 Well, what are we going to do about this movie situation? What about "The Notebook"?
 That is so not the point.
 Because I am a winner when it comes to successful relationships.
 You have no idea.
 To play devil's advocate, maybe there is a great reason why he's not telling you. Maybe he is just trying to protect you.
 Sometimes it's harder than that.
 You know what we need? Dancing. There is a band at the Grill.
 Hey, Matt.
 Yeah, but I can't do anything about it.
 Yeah, but I am still keeping so many secrets.
 Hey, everybody. Let's hear it for the band! Weren't they awesome?
 So there's this guy. And, uh, he told me to tell him how I feel about him. Like it's so easy. Um, you know, just 'cause I talk a lot doesn't mean I always know what I'm actually talking about. Ah, like now, I'm feeling loopy and I don't really know how to express myself.
 I can sing. Yeah! Yeah. You know what, I'm going to sing.
 You are going to let me live out my rock star fantasies, and you are going to be my back-up.
 Matt...I...
 Sorry Elena!
 Definitely.
 Mmm!
 Even better.
 Hey.
 What's going on?
 Oh my God!
 Well, what can I do?
 Matt, no!
 Matt! Matt! Oh! Oh, my God!
 Just breathe Caroline...just breathe.
 You have to drink. Please, please.
 Hi.
 You were dying. My blood healed you.
 Because that's what vampire blood does for humans, and that's what I am. I'm a vampire, Matt.
 But it's all going to be okay, because I am going to tell you everything, and you're going to understand why I had to keep it from you, and we're going to be fine.
 Yes, because we're together and we love each other.
 What?
 Nothing. Nothing! Matt!
 No, no, no! I can't let you leave. I cannot let you leave.
 Nothing! Nothing! I swear, I swear, nothing, nothing!
 Nothing, Matt! You have to calm down! Matt!
 I can't find him anywhere. He's not at home. He's not answering his phone.
 My mom walked in. He took off. I didn't know what to do.
 No. She just thinks we're fighting but he knows about me, and he's freaking out about Vicki.
 I slip it into his soda when he's at work, but I didn't get to last night, so it's out of his system. He has a catering shift at the Lockwood's today. I'm gonna try there.
 Call Matt.
 Mrs. Lockwood, uh, have you seen Matt? I thought he was working a catering shift at today's luncheon.
 Yeah, of course. Um, still no word from him?
 Um, excuse me.
 None. What if he tells somebody? What if he tells everybody?
 You know, this wasn't how it was supposed to happen. You know, I was supposed to tell him at the right moment in the right way, and he was supposed to be okay with it because he loves me.
 All right. Well, call me when you're done, and I'll be out looking for him.
 Hey, Matt, if you're listening to this that means you've listened to the last 25 messages I've left you, which all say the same thing, so...call me.
 You're here.
 My mom?
 Did you tell her anything else?
 Matt...
 Why'd you stick around if you're still scared of me?
 I'll tell you anything you wanna know.
 So after I hurt you in the woods, I made you forget and I promised myself I would stay away from you, but I-I couldn't...'Cause I love you. I do. I love you, Matt, so much. God, I'm so sorry about what happened to Vicki. And I really wish you'd say something.
 No, you're not.
 I'm still me. I'm still me. It's just I'm just a little bit...
 Tell me what I can do. Tell me what I can do. I...I want to help you.
 I don't-I don't think that that's...
 But maybe after...
 Okay. Okay, Matt.
 Hey, Dana. Um, can you take care of these?
 Okay, thank you.
 Hey.
 What was that for?
 Perfect.
 There you are! You almost missed me. How do I look?
 Duh.
 Thanks. Is everything okay?
 Well, you work too much.
 Mr. President.
 Hi.
 Sorry.
 We will.
 Dance with me.
 I know better than that.
 What?
 What's wrong?
 What?!
 Where?
 Hey! Are you okay?
 Seriously, what's wrong?
 Oh, you know, just the same old drama.
 Sorry! I didn't mean to scare you.
 Yeah, I wanted to try and catch you on your break so we could hang out.
 Perfect. I will go run some errands and I will be right back.
 I'll see you in a bit.
 Tyler? Jules.
 So what, are you two, like, friends now?
 I heard about your mom. I just came to check in on her.
 And you? Um...How's everything with you?
 Good.
 You're leaving again?
 Your explanation must have got lost in the mail, along with your goodbye.
 Tyler...
 Tyler?
 Yeah. I think so.
 Those witches vervained me.
 I think they're with Klaus.
 Tyler...You shouldn't have come back here.
 That's what Elena learned. Klaus still needs to do the sacrifice, but it's just not for that.
 Yes.
 I think so. Yes.
 Why didn't you say good-bye? You just left.
 Well, if we're going to die, I might as well know the truth. Why did you leave me?
 I was hurt. You know, you turned your back on me when I needed you. But...I could never hate you, Tyler.
 Damon?
 What, Matt?
 No, I...
 Wait, Damon No! I'm not leaving without him.
 I'll help.
 Hey, Matt!
 Hey. Did you hit him?!
 Tyler? Tyler?
 Come on.
 Tyler, it'll be okay.
 You've got time. We're almost there, just...
 Tyler, it's okay.
 Damon...
 Come on, down here.
 No.
 Help me with the gate. Help me with the gate!
 Tyler? It's me. It's Caroline. Tyler?
 Get back, I got it!
 Tyler, please!
 Matt! No, hey, no! It's Tyler!
 Wait!
 He's wounded.
 We can go around him.
 You're not going to shoot him again, okay? Okay. Matt, take my hand.
 
 Come on. Get in here!
 Do you see anything?
 How did you even know what I was? I compelled you to forget!
 Wait, my mom knows?! Oh my God! You told her. Well, what'd she say?
 Well, what about you?
 Where does this leave us?
 No. No. It takes a lot more than wooden bullets to kill a werewolf. He's still out there somewhere. Do you think my mom wants to kill me?
 Yeah, well, I don't really know what to do with me, either.
 Wait.
 Don't. Don't shoot.
 
 Your jacket, take it off.
 Hey.
 Hey. It's okay. It's okay.
 Sleeping. He should be better by morning. He just...He needs some rest.
 
 But you can. Matt...
 Matt!
 Hey.
 Ooh, yeah, you got shot. But it's healing.
 No, you just...should have never left. And you shouldn't leave again.
 Well, no friendship is perfect.
 Matt broke up with me.
 Yeah, well, you know, instead of just bailing on me again, you could just say..."Thank you, Caroline, for taking care of me. And I'm sorry that I tried to chow down on you again."
 You're welcome.
 Hey! There you guys are. Who's hungry?
 Yes, we are really doing this. We are going to take a page from Scarlett. We made it through the war.
 I know you guys went through hell, and my mom knows I am a vampire, so basically it's like Atlanta has burned. And yet, in spite of everything, we persevere.
 Something good.
 All this waiting around for news is ruining Scarlett for me.
 Mom. Mom, what did you do?
 He still has his ring.
 I got it.
 Come on, Jeremy. Just drink. Go on, Jeremy. Drink.
 I'm helping him. Jeremy, drink. Please. Please. Please.
 Mom, you let them go.
 That was Bonnie. Jeremy's alive.
 You did.
 I explained it to you once. I...I had to make you forget because I was so scared of what you might do. But now...I don't wanna lie. I'm not gonna be afraid of you anymore.
 I don't want you to be afraid of me anymore. I'm still your little girl.
 It's me. It's me, mom.
 Just shopping for the party you're trying to bail out on.
 You were never going to which is why I planned it anyway. And my mom wants you to call her.
 An animal attack in Memphis. It's the third one this week in Tennessee.
 Yes, but that doesn't mean that it's Klaus.
 Well call her on her cell.
 All right. Well, I gotta go. I'll see you in a bit.
 Wear something pretty. Hi!
 Something's up with your mother.
 When I was over yesterday she just kept eyeing me.
 Did Matt make you switch sections? He thinks we're dating.
 What?
 That's crazy.
 Tyler!
 Tyler!
 I'm sorry!
 Just because I tell you things doesn't mean you're allowed to know them!
 Wait. You're bringing a date? Slutty Sophie is your date?
 Yeah, tell me about it, sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode! It's a...vampire...thing. Yeah, our emotions are heightened and we're on overdrive.
 Yeah. Well. Uh, I hope you'll get, uh, lucky tonight.
 Yeah, see you later.
 You like? Don't answer that.
 Oh...the Stoner den. Buzzkill.
 He hates me. His hatred of me, has driven him to drugs!
 I thought you were ignoring me?
 You only said five words to me all summer, and those were four of them.
 Because he's my friend! Which is what I thought you were.
 Matt, shhhh! What is wrong with you?
 Nothing.
 Now leave it!
 This room's off limits!
 Sorry. Are you hiding?
 Well, he better be here somewhere because we haven't even done the cake yet.
 What? no, no way, no! It's your birthday! You know it's the dawn of a new day and, you can't get on with your life until you have made a wish and blown out the candles.
 No...Maybe...I just don't think anyone wants to see you like this.
 Of course not. And you shouldn't, but you have to admit that you kinda just letting your life pass you by. And isn't Stefan the one who wanted to make sure that you lived it?
 I'm sorry, okay. I'm just drunk and dumb tonight. Wait, what are you doing..,?
 What's all that?
 Why wouldn't he just tell you?
 Excuse me. Excuse me.
 Why would I be pissed? You brought a date. You're dating. That's...awesome.
 Hey, you're horny all the time, right? I mean, a guy has needs.
 What would I say?
 Uh huh.
 Hey! You missed the cake.
 Mrs. Lockwood. Hi.
 I...I didn't mean to be so...I mean, we were just...I'm going to just...Get my purse. Okay?
 Hello! Mrs. Lockwood?! Somebody!
 Who's that? Mrs. Lockwood?! Please.
 Daddy?
 Daddy, are you there? Why won't you talk to me? Dad!
 Dad...
 Just let me go.
 Is that all you want to know?
 No, dad, no! What are you...
 What are you doing? What are you doing?
 What are you doing?
 What?
 No! Please! Stop! Please stop! Please!
 I don't hurt anyone, I swear. Dad, I swear. I can handle the urges. I can!
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
 That's impossible. Daddy, you can't change who I am.
 No.
 No! No! No! No, no!
 Dad, I'm okay. I've learned to adapt. I don't need to be fixed. I can't be fixed.
 I can't.
 Daddy, I'm starving.
 Why? You know that this isn't going to work.
 Why are you trying to fix me?
 Daddy, I'm sorry.
 Tyler.
 My ring.
 Thank you.
 You did.
 I just thought that he was the one who got me.
 Hey, mom? Thanks for believing in me.
 He hates me. My dad hates me.
 I come bearing gifts!
 After the last few days, I would kill for a normal family.
 Since when did you learn how to cook?
 Ahh! Did I splash you?
 Maybe it's a sign you shouldn't be wearing it.
 What, I'm just saying. If you're going to be "cooking" without Stefan.
 So you're not, like, switching Salvatores, are you?
 Stay focused.
 As your friend who worries for you daily, what is the deal with you and Damon?
 Yeah, but that doesn't make him any less Damon. If my own father, who I love dearly, can't change me. No one's changing Damon. Not even you.
 What are you doing?
 Did Stefan ever tell you where he got the necklace?
 Probably off somewhere doing bad things to good people. Consider me the honesty police.
 It's my dad.
 I don't know. But I can't...
 How was football practice?
 Hiding out from my dad. He's here.
 Yes. No. I bought him the shirt he's wearing, and it's really expensive.
 And through everything...He's still my dad. You know?
 God, you reek!
 It's bad.
 No! It's really bad.
 Oh! Hang on, my phone.
 I'm only answering in case it's a friend emergency.
 Daddy! Are you okay?
 Here. It'll heal you.
 Grow up.
 Just get out of here.
 Well, I'm angrier!
 I'm not going to say I told you so.
 But I did tell you....so.
 Wait. I...It's been a long week, so I'm just going to be blunt. It doesn't matter what he does, Damon's gotten under your skin.
 God, just admit it, Elena, okay? You are attracted to him! In all of his bad brother glory.
 Wait, no, you're not attracted to him, or no, you just won't admit it?
 It says you're human, Elena.
 No, I got it.
 Hey.
 How's your...
 You're welcome.
 Daddy. I'm going to be okay.
 Ohh! Oh, come on! Seriously?! Do you know how long it took for us to set all this up?!
 How could you forget? We've only been waiting for this since like freshman year.
 We're about to be seniors. These are the memories that will stay with us forever, and if we don't...
 Go ahead and make fun, I don't care.
 I love you!
 Do you think Matt's going to be okay?
 I'm asking you if you think our friend, who we both love, is okay.
 I just want this school year to be great, you know? I just want everyone to be happy. Even in the midst of all the crazy unhappy bits.
 Uh, do we know you?
 And who are you?
 Where's Tyler?
 What did you do to him?
 Tyler.
 Klaus is turning you into a vampire. A hybrid. You're in transition.
 You're going to be okay. Okay? It's going to be okay.
 No! No, no, no, Tyler, don't!
 Are you sure you're okay?
 Here we are. Senior year.
 Okay. So prank night was a bust. But we are accepting it, and we are moving on.
 Yes! And why should I let the fact that my boyfriend was turned into a hybrid put a damper on an otherwise fabulous day.
 Yeah. You win.
 You have to go. It's our first spirit squad event. And it sets the bar for the whole year.
 Thank you. It's just that...
 Oh my God!
 Vampire 101...don't wear your breakfast to school!
 From where?
 Rebekah? And what are you even talking to her for?
 His what? Why are you amused by this?
 Oh, wow! I cannot believe you just said that.
 What are you doing?
 Hey. Hey. You can't just come here and infiltrate all of our lives.
 Try to be a little more subtle, Tyler.
 Then why are you acting like this?
 What?!
 My God!
 Yes! I will make sure that the old Forbes jail cell is prepped and ready.
 Why not?
 But Klaus is the bad guy, Tyler. You know, why are you acting like some freaky, hybrid, slave minion.
 Okay, can we cool it on the commentary, please.
 What are you doing?!
 So how do I fix him?
 I brought you here. You were being a d-bag.
 My problem is you've been sired. Do you even know what that means? It means that you put Klaus's needs first. He is your master now.
 Well, something's got to be controlling you. Because I don't know why else you'd be acting like the old you.
 Yeah. The old you. The pre-werewolf you. You know, the obnoxious you that I would never be friends with.
 You're a vampire now, Tyler. Everything about your personality is heightened. So you have to be careful.
 You have to earn the overnighter.
 Bye.
 So when you did the spell to send Vicki away, did that get rid of Anna, too?
 Okay, you don't think I can actually resist commenting on that.
 Bonnie...
 Well, I want you to say you're not okay with it.
 And why would you think that?
 I thought you said that ghosts couldn't physically interact with people.
 Why do you think it's Vicki and not Mason?
 I feel so sad for him. It took a lot for him to send his sister away.
 So much strength as a man.
 Okay, did your grimoire just...
 Okay, please tell me that's a recipe for witch cookies.
 What's veiled matter?
 So this is where you brought Jeremy back to life?
 Hmm. There's no chance it's haunted by the hundred dead witches who were horrifically burned to death in this very spot, is there?
 Right. You pinkie swear?
 Ready? Do you need me to do...
 Right. Okay.
 Bonnie, I don't like this. Bonnie...
 Oh, my God. Is that your...?
 Hi, Miss Sheila.
 Apparently the old witch can draw power from this side because of her talisman.
 It's some ju-ju power source. And I know you're not going to like this, but Bonnie needs to destroy it.
 What?! Are you kidding?
 So the necklace isn't where Damon said it would be and now we can't reach Damon.
 What?! But you said you were in full support of getting rid of them.
 Okay, let's just find it first and then we'll choose between boyfriend ghost dramas.
 Um...Lexi's back, so Elena wants us to hold off on destroying the necklace.
 Elena caught Jeremy kissing Anna.
 I'm sorry.
 She's got a foothold now, so she probably thinks that she's here to stay. But you and I, Bonnie, we're going to find that necklace. Okay? Okay.
 Ugh! I give up. It's not anywhere in this room.
 What do you want, Jeremy?
 Not yet. Wait, what's going on?
 Well, it's not where it's supposed to be. Unless someone took it.
 Well, who do you think?
 Oh, and you believe her.
 You know what, you're an even bigger idiot than I thought. So wake up, Jeremy, before you lose everything.
 Jeremy's got the necklace. He's going to meet us at the witch house.
 It's Mrs. Lockwood's car.
 Bonnie? I'm going to get out of the car.
 And you're going to drive the hell away from here.
 Bonnie, you've got your ghost boyfriend drama. Elena has hers. And right now the mother of mine is about to be ghost bait. So go and send them all back to the other side, okay?
 Hey, can you hand me the glitter gun? Thanks.
 Oh, I have a thermos in my bag.
 Okay, first of all, I finally almost just got your mother to stop hating me- so I probably don't wanna get caught in some weird vampire threesome with her son. And secondly, quit hanging out with Rebekah the evil blood slut.
 So, who has the misfortune of being compelled to be her date?
 What? You set her up with Matt?
 The big deal, Tyler, is that Matt is an innocent, good person, who should not be going to dances with evil blood sluts!
 This is a sire thing, isn't it? Please tell me this is some weird family extension of your sire bond to Klaus!
 What happened?
 What?
 Excuse me? What are we supposed to do now?
 You wish! No, Tyler is moving the party to his house.
 Just say you're still coming?!
 How did he plan a better party than me so fast? What? Is that a band outside?
 This is weird! Where is Tyler?
 Hey...Klaus is here.
 Yeah! Apparently our sired hybrid-friend Tyler thought it would be okay to let his master throw a party! I expected more surprise!
 What's going on? And what are you two doing here together? Thought you were supposed to be here with Rebekah.
 Uh - nothing.
 Okay, I don't know what you're talking about.
 You know, actually, I'm not. I don't know anything. But even if I did, I wouldn't tell you about it, because you are sired to team Klaus now. And you can't be trusted. So can we please just go back to the party now?
 What do you think?
 Oh, yeah, not hey Caroline, um, I worried about what might happened this evening so maybe you should just go home and watch Dancing with the Stars?
 No.
 This isn't funny, Tyler! How am I supposed to be with you when you're sired to him?!
 Understand what? That you're one of the bad guys now?
 But...How are you okay with it?
 But...you don't have any true control over yourself.
 Tyler...
 I just...
 I can't talk to you.
 Upset? You almost got Jeremy killed! And before you ask me to understand, or to support you, can you at least tell me what you're planning to do about your sire-bond to Klaus?
 I'm sorry too.
 What are you guys doing here?
 Thanks, guys. Really, um, I'm just not feeling my birthday this year.
 Yeah, and now, it's just a reminder that technically, I'm dead. Look, I didn't even like 17. And the only point to being 17 is to get to 18. It's a filler year; I'm stuck in a filler year.
 Yeah I am, but it's okay. You know, it's all good, I'll be fine. But I just need some time to wallow in it.
 Okay. Here lies Caroline Forbes...
 Ah, none taken.
 What? Nothing.
 I might have texted Tyler.
 What? I'm delicate.
 No, it's-it's okay. 
 Tyler, it's okay. Maybe we just weren't meant to be together. Maybe we just have to accept that and move on.
 What?
 Ouch! What the hell? What just happened?
 Did you just bite me?
 Oh my god! Just get away from me! Get away from me!
 I'm sorry, Mom.
 
 Yes.
 Yeah. Aren't you like...a billion, or something?
 No, I'm dying.
 I don't wanna die.
 What are you doing here?
 Apologize?! You bit me. I could've died. I think we're way past apologies, Tyler.
 Daddy?
 Can you help him?
 Why?
 How do you know, this is gonna work?
 But how can he turn? It's not a full moon.
 Can't he just rest for one second?
 What?! No! Tyler!
 Yes. Dr. Fell, hi! Elena told me you helped out my dad.
 Yeah, my dad's a little set in his ways. He spent his whole life hating vampires, so...
 So, can I take him home?
 Oh, I...he didn't call or anything.
 Yeah, we've had our ups and downs.
 Thanks.
 Yeah, he's not here. He was already discharged. And she seems perfectly nice by the way...a little intense, maybe. But...I think it's sweet, you wanna make sure Alaric's not dating a total psycho.
 I hear it.
 My dad's phone.
 Dad! Dad?
 Don't be dead, don't be dead, don't be dead! Oh my god!
 Daddy!
 What?!
 I compelled the nurse to stay out of this room. You'll be safe here.
 Daddy, why don't you just come lay down and just relax?
 Well, maybe Doctor Fell can give you something.
 Thanks.
 Look, we'll figure this out, but in the mean time we need to get you some blood.
 No. And I've left messages for him everywhere. So, does Alaric really think that Dr. Fell did it?
 What about you?
 My mom's in there sitting with my dad. And I don't think they've been in the same room this long since I was ten years old. Is there any chance that Tyler did it?
 If Klaus was trying to mess with you and he's sired to Klaus. And, I mean, he does everything that he's told.
 I can't just let my father die. You know, I'm...I'm gonna force him to feed.
 I hated him so much for what he did to me. So much. Now all I want to do is save his life.
 What was the hardest part for you? When you lost your Dad?
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Yep. I was afraid to join the squad, but you talked me into it.
 How are you feeling?
 Can I get you anything? Or um...do you want me to call Steven?
 Listen, listen to me. I know that you think you made your choice, but you can change your mind. You know, you are strong enough to handle being a vampire. I mean, you're the strongest person that I know.
 God. How can you hate who I am so much?!
 Please don't leave me, Daddy. Please...please don't leave me. Daddy just don't leave me.
 
 It's some twisted Cinderella fetish is what it is. And why does the Evil Witch want an audience with you?
 I thought you told Damon and Stefan that you weren't going.
 Well, I think a Salvatore would look a lot better in a tux. And by that I mean Stefan.
 Why, cause you two made out? Bonnie spilled the beans.
 Elena, when you and Matt kissed for the first time freshman year, you called me the second it happened. And now I don't hear about this til now, and from somebody else.
 Oh my god. She's inviting him to the ball. Why is she inviting him?
 
 I need a drink.
 Well, it was either caviar or sympathy casseroles.
 Don't. Seriously.
 I didn't really have time to shop.
 Well, I've had training. I happen to be Miss Mystic Falls.
 What are you doing? Why are you here with the She-Devil?
 Don't even get me started.
 I'm not talking to you until you tell me why you invited me here.
 Yes!
 Well I'm spoken for. By Tyler.
 Yeah, because of you and your freaky sire bond with him.
 Did you ever consider sitting down with your father and talking it out?
 Maybe so. But I let my father go with no regrets. And to answer your question, yes, I like horses. But I also like people and they actually like me so I'll be inside.
 So what did you want to show me?
 Oh. Impressive. I take it the curators at the Louvre aren't on vervain.
 What about these? Where'd you steal this from?
 Wait a second. Did-did you do these?
 I've never really been anywhere.
 Oh wow!
 Must be really nice to just snap your fingers and get whatever you want. Is that why you collect hybrids? A little servant army to take you places and bring you things.
 Then why do you need Tyler? Stop controlling him. Give him his life back.
 I get it. Your father didn't love you, so you assume that no one else will either. And that's why you compel people or you sire them or you try to buy them off.
 But that's not how it works. You don't connect with people, because you don't even try to understand them.
 Have you guys seen Matt?
 Tyler, it's me. Look, I'm grateful for what you're doing, but...I miss you...and I really wish you were here.
 
 It's not working. I can hear every word you're saying about Damon, the vampire gigolo.
 Okay. First of all, this privacy spell is totally not working. Second. Elena, you are not doing this, Esther is doing this.
 Oh, it's you.
 Mmm, I'd rather die of thirst. But thanks.
 Are you serious? Take a hint.
 Ah, well, I'm not.
 You and your expensive jewelry and your romantic drawings can leave me alone.
 Fine. 
 Just to be clear, I'm too smart to be seduced by you.
 What is it?
 Nothing.
 I didn't do anything. Stop it!
 She doesn't want to see you.
 Abby's in transition. It's going to be really hard over the next few days and if Bonnie needs some time to deal then I think you should give it to her.
 I'm sorry, Elena. I know that you want to help, but put yourself in her shoes. Everything that happened tonight was to save you and that's okay because she loves you. So much. But somehow she's always the one who gets hurt.
 Of course I will.
 Hey.
 I totally lucked out. The hospital just had a blood drive, so I got some O negatives, some A's, and my personal favorite 
 Well, it's only been a few days since she turned. Your mom is still adjusting.
 Ms. Wilson, why don't you come inside? Have something to drink?
 I don't understand.
 Haven't seen you up at the house. Abby's been asking for you.
 Easy! I was just gonna help you carry the fire wood up. You're scared of her.
 She needs to feel connected to the people she loves. She needs to feel normal right now.
 Well, Abby didn't choose this, this was forced on her. She could have let herself die, but she didn't. She's trying to make this work so she can be there for you and for Bonnie. So.....
 So, just get over yourself, okay?
 Hey, what's going on?
 Sorry, she's still mad and seriously Abby's transition has been a little rough, so she's got a lot on her mind.
 He's fine. Nothing a little vampire blood can't cure.
 Now, I need a favor.
 So, Abby thinks Bonnie can reverse the damage of the spell. I guess this same thing happens to witches who get obsessed with dark magic. They lose control and start acting out their darkest impulses.
 I'm gonna hang back here with Abby, but Bonnie's leaving now, so....
 Hold on.
 Am I even doing this right?
 Well, I went through the same thing once. With my dad. But it didn't really work out, so...you know. Well, when Bonnie gets back she can snap her fingers or wave her hands or whatever and make the herbs bloom.
 I think Abby's up.
 What are you doing? 
 Do what? Be a vampire or a parent? Because I can help you be a vampire, I can teach you self-control, but being a parent, I mean that's all you. Bonnie grew up without a mom, because you ran away once, but now you have an eternity to make up for it and you're just gonna throw that away?
 No, she's not. No one is better off without their parents. She wants to make this work. Please. Just stay.
 Alaric Saltzman killed my father?
 Yeah, and that's supposed to make everything okay?
 Or me.
 Oh, Elena Gilbert, savior of the cursed and the damned.
 Um, Bonnie's mom bailed on her. Again. So, I think we should leave her out of this one.
 Why do I always have to be Klaus bait?
 Clearly. She slept with you.
 Ow!
 Oh, I'm ready. Anything that will free Tyler from his sire bond to Klaus.
 Yeah.
 Hey. I hear you had a run in with Buffy the vampire.
 Checking up on you. In case you're not you.
 Well I guess not you would say that too. Which is why...
 Elena said you have to drink this. I hope it tastes better than it smells.
 It's either that or kill people, so. Elena told me everything.
 Right after I turned into a vampire, I killed someone. A stranger. I just...killed him. And what's worse is I liked it. I have blood on my hands too, I mean we all do.
 Yeah, it is. And maybe the guy I killed was someone's father too. Look, all I know is, I'm no better than you. So, I'm going to take a page from the Elena Gilbert handbook and choose to believe that you can be saved. Okay?
 He'll be okay. I gave him a bottle of Bonnie's herbs and he went home. Oh, did you guys kill Finn, did it work?
 I miss well-adjusted Stefan.
 So, Sage and this Troy guy die within an hour of Finn.
 Hybrid bites don't look like that. Maybe Sage was so in love with Finn she just died of sadness.
 Wait, so when an Original dies every vampire turned from their bloodline dies along with them? Because that would mean...
 Vampire disposal. Not my strong suit. Uck. Where'd Stefan go?
 All of them?
 How are we supposed to do that?
 Well, who turned Rose?
 Elena.
 Even if Klaus didn't create our bloodline, we know for a fact that he turned one of us.
 What is this?
 No. 
 What do you think you're doing?
 Yeah, me. I'm the chair of the Dance Committee. The theme of the decade dance is the 1970s.
 Maybe he sees a challenge. See, unlike some other people, I don't sleep with everyone I make eye contact with.
 Traitor!
 Whatever. Have fun at your stupid dance.
 Impressive! You sold it!
 Thank you. Just keep her occupied. Be careful!
 Hi.
 Mm, at some point we are going to do this in an actual bed, right?
 Tell him to suck it. You broke his sire bond, you won't have to deal with him anymore.
 Wait, I thought you said that's why you were coming back, because you said you felt different.
 Good. Because Klaus might not be our only problem.
 Matt killed an Original and then every vampire that Original had ever turned mysteriously died. Right now, Damon is desperate to figure out which Original created our vampire bloodline and if he finds out it wasn't Klaus, they're all gonna kill him.
 I know that. They know that. The difference is Damon doesn't care.
 My mom said you could stay as long as you want.
 No. She said you could sleep on the couch. At least until we figure out what Damon and Stefan find out about Klaus.
 Tyler, I just got you back.
 I'm not losing you again.
 Huh?
 Yeah, Klaus is pretty creepy. Even when he's trying to be charming.
 No, as far as I'm concerned, he is incapable of real feelings.
 Tyler. Nothing. Nothing happened.
 I don't know!
 Tyler. Tyler!
 So, Alaric is trying to pull himself together, why is that a bad thing?
 You know what, if Rebekah wanted to hang this monstrousity she should have shown up to do it herself. 
 What are you doing? You can't just hang them! They're supposed to trickle down.
 Look at them all bromancy.
 That was nice of him.
 You sure it has nothing to do with witnessing you and Damon getting hot and heavy in a skeevy motel?
 Aww, what are friends for? So who are you bringing to the dance?
 Hm, Bonnie has a date.
 Jamie called and wanted to see her so she asked him.
 So here's a thought, why don't you ask Stefan?
 All the more reason! Look you're supposed to be figuring out what you want, that's what Stefan wanted you to do, right?
 But nothing! I've watched The Bachelor, okay? Fair is fair. It is Stefan's turn.
 I'm sorry, but Stefan is your epic love. And I'm not going down without a fight.
 Have I told you how amazingly awesome you are?
 I know that you and Elena have been getting closer lately...
 One way or the other she is pretty much spoken for.
 And I'm just looking out for you. Because sometimes the people who love her get caught in the crossfire.
 Are you crazy? If Klaus sees you...
 Tyler, this isn't a joke!
 Tyler, you do not need to be jealous of Klaus.
 What is it?
 Yes! Actually we do.
 Why do you always have to prove you're the alpha male?!
 Hmpf, I don't suppose that ever happened to their dance partners.
 Hmpf!
 You let them go?! They're gonna get themselves killed!
 Hey, she'll be fine. Elena always manages to find her way through this stuff.
 So, best case scenario  Bonnie get's us out of here, Klaus hauls ass to Timbuktu and you and I, we're home free.
 That's not a best case scenario. That's not even a remotely acceptable scenario!
 How could you say that?
 What were you supposed to do? He can't know that you're not sired any more. Tyler, it doesn't matter how many times I dance with him. I love you.
 What do you mean you're ditching my clean up committee?
 Well, since when does sire bond equal mover slave?
 Ugh, he's being petty.
 I love you too.
 Hello?
 Where's Matt?
 Are you kidding me? So, it's just us?
 It's like 8 02.
 I'm sorry about your mom. I mean I know you like, hated her and everything, but still...I'm sorry.
 Yeah. He was.
 
 
 Welcome to our victory party!
 Here. You need this.
 I heard. And you know that sooner or later, you're gonna have to choose, right?
 Way too long.
 All right, let's drink!
 Couch.
 All right, couch, now!
 Doctor says rest, you rest.
 Now, what can I get you? Do you want some tea, maybe some vodka? Both will help you sleep.
 I know, I'm being smothering. It's what I do.
 I'm thinking-maybe tea with vodka.
 Mom.
 What are you saying?
 Well, we can't just pack up and leave!
 We can't just leave town.
 But our friends need us.
 I'll go anywhere with you. I mean, if we have to spend the rest of our lives running, I will run with you. But, first, I have to help our friends.
 Deal!
 Just you. Maybe a curling iron.
 Oh, I have to tell Bonnie!
 Okay.
 Stefan?
 Tyler! Tyler!
 Oh my God.
 Tyler! Oh my God.
 Klaus died. He's dead.
 No, it's not me that I'm worried about.
 No, I feel fine.
 No, I'm not leaving.
 I'm staying.
 Yes!
 I'm not leaving.
 She doesn't want to be dead and now she's not. This isn't your fault, Matt.
 Shh! Cool it on the V word. I'm a fugitive, remember? I'm supposed to be halfway to Florida by now.
 Because I don't know where to go. 
 Mom, hey!
 Where am I? Uh...Good question. Uh...there's just a whole lot of boring highways. Why, is everything okay?
 Vervain ropes. Looks like Alaric outed us all to the Council.
 
 
 I never thought I'd see you again! I don't get it. How are you alive?
 But you're miraculously alive. We're fugitives on the run. All signs point to hot hybrid vampire sex.
 Did you just call me "love"?
 What the hell did you do to Tyler?!
 Oh my God, you're Klaus. You're disgusting!
 Oh, you do one semi-decent thing and now you're my hero? Oh, I need to go sanitize my mouth!
 Put Tyler back!
 She said she can't okay?
 We'll just wait a few days until you're strong enough to do it with traditional magic, right Bonnie?
 What are you doing?
 You're hurting him! Stop! Stop!
 Stop, please! You're killing him!
 Tyler?
 Tyler?
 Bonnie, what's happening?
 Bonnie, stop!
 This is wrong. A bunch of people died and we're having sex.
 It's selfish.
 We need to be more sensitive.
 Tyler.
 I love you too.
 Please tell me that's the last one.
 Are the bullets spelled?
 Also, if he shows his face, I'm gonna kick his ass.
 
 I got it. Go.
 No, he's fine.
 Elena.
 She's not dead, but if you feed on her you will kill her!
 Look at her! Look at her, Elena! It's April. April Young. She's not a warm body for you to feed on. She's your friend.
 She's an orphan. Just like you. She's scared. Just like you were.
 No one's gonna hurt you. No one's gonna hurt you.
 She needs you. You can make her forget all of this.
 No. The only way you're going to learn is if you do it yourself.
 Yes, you can. You just need to believe what you're telling her. Okay?
 This is for my dad. And Tyler's.
 
 Does she seem a little off-balance to you?
 Ripper-you?
 
 You should write a book. Go on The View.
 I ditched Rebekah's ditching party.
 
 Says who? Your mom? 
 
 But, I'd rather hang with you.
 Hey.
 Not every day I get summoned by a Salvatore. So, what's up?
 You mean an insecure control-freak?
 Yeah.
 But you don't know how to be around her and still resist that urge.
 
 My mom put squad cars blocking the streets. They're saying it's a faulty gas main. We're good to go.
 She can't do magic.
 Uh, who are you?
 Caroline.
 Well, Hayley, that's pretty crazy, because I haven't heard a thing about you.
 Excuse me?
 I know all of Ty's buddies and I haven't heard about you. So, how about we cut the crap?
 Tyler, don't.
 I apologize. Am I intruding?
 I keep waiting for you to make up some dumb story so at least I can call you a liar. Is that now?
 Thank you. How big of you.
 No, you don't tell me what I have to do. I went through hell when I thought you died. I cried like an idiot and this whole time you've been keeping a secret from me about falling for some werewolf in the Appalachians!
 
 Then, why would Klaus think that?
 I brought your stuff. Old laptop, your jersey, the charm bracelet.
 Just take it.
 Do you think he bought it?
 
 Actually, you're not.
 That's exactly what he's telling you.
 
 I want you to give Elena back.
 Why not?
 That's none of your business, actually.
 Yeah. Thanks.
 So, here's the thing, I didn't just come here to try to get you to release Elena.
 I came here to distract you so that Stefan could go to your house and break her out, which he did. And, don't get mad, but then he lost her.
 Klaus.
 They figured out how to stop the hallucinations.
 Tyler.
 Tyler, we didn't have a choice.
 But we needed to help our friend.
 Chris wasn't...
 I agreed to go on a date with him.
 I just thought that it might help keep up the ruse between you and Hayley.
 What do you mean you're not coming? I don't need to remind you that your Miss Mystic Falls attendance record totally sucks.
 Besides, you're a founding family member, by definition you have to be here.
 Did that sound as depressing to you as it did to me?
 Well, you can't. As your sober sponsor, I am not going to let that happen. Try and sublimate.
 What?! She can't have feelings for Damon! He's...Damon. And you're...you. And I'm – revolted. You know, I'm gonna talk to her. I'm going to shake some sense into her clearly diseased brain.
 All the more reason you need to cure her.
 
 Look, I'm your best friend and I would never pick sides, but are you sure that this is what you want? Because Stefan is your soul mate.
 Sorry. Picking sides.
 Yeah, I know. Stefan filled me in on all the gory Damon details.
 No, he's heartbroken.
 No, but you weren't supposed to let Damon weasel his way into your confused newbie vampire heart.
 Uh, inside by the parlor.
 Mhm.
 He's also the one that has Bonnie so obsessed with practicing magic that she bailed on pageant prep.
 Woah, woah, woah, stop, stop!
 Those flowers go in the back as indicated by the floral chart that you guys had plenty of time to memorize.
 Yeah, thank you.
 Go away. I'm busy.
 How about a quarter to never?
 Yes, a date. Like to a movie where we don't have to talk and I can put at least three seats between us.
 Fine. If you insist on coming, meet me here. Two p.m. 
 She's right. Gracie Lockwood had a three-foot slit her year and practically got laughed off the court.
 Get out, lurker!
 Check the judges' table.
 We've already agreed that the red one is a little bit too showy.
 Did you win Miss Mystic last year? No. I don't think you did.
 Nobody cares what you think.
 Uh, what happened to thirty seconds ago when you hated the red one? What happened to safe is good?
 What just happened?
 Hey, why am I bussing your tables?
 I said no empty glasses.
 Will you guys pick up the tempo?!
 This is a pageant, not a funeral.
 You're...perfect.
 Just so beyond annoying, I can't even look at you.
 Let's just get today over with.
 Hi, everyone, I'm Caroline Forbes.
 As the reigning Miss Mystic Falls, it is my honor to introduce this year's Miss Mystic Court.
 We begin the procession with Valerie Fell accompanied by Dylan Clark.
 Next, we have Amber Wolvertine accompanied by Hector Lindsay.
 Katherine Wilson accompanied by Eric Hanson.
 And finally, we have a last minute entry, April Young accompanied by Jeremy Gilbert.
 Hey, what's with the last minute escort change? Where is Jeremy?
 Okay, you go home, I'm gonna start asking around here.
 No, Damon is never right. Damon is sneaky and manipulative and rude, but he's never right. How can you not see that?
 Fine, friend-tervention. I think your so-called "feelings" for Damon are really starting to cloud your judgment and I don't like it.
 And the thought of you two together really makes me want to barf.
 How did I become the bad guy?
 It's just, as her best friend, it is my duty to warn her when she's making a giant mistake, right? And now she's taking Damon's side on everything.
 But being a vampire only amplifies who you already are. It doesn't turn you into a completely different person.
 What's that look for?
 Whatever, just – just hurry up and find the cure.
 Would you ever take it?
 So there's not one single moment in your whole life that you wanted to be human?
 Is that my Miss Mystic application?
 Where did you get that?!
 Yeah, it's very funny.
 It's hilarious. Just-
 This year's Miss Mystic Falls is....
 April Young.
 No, you're right, Stefan. It's not pretty and it's not easy, but you can't give up on her.
 She's lost. Okay, you and her, epic. Her and Damon, ugh, God. There's something wrong with her. Just promise me you won't stop looking for the cure.
 Why does he care? He doesn't even want it.
 He's gonna need them. Tyler's almost got all of them unsired.
 Oh my God.
 Oh. My. God.
 I was trying to understand why Klaus was so intrigued by Damon and Elena. He said I would figure it out. This is what he was talking about.
 Think about it. Every time Elena's had a problem, Damon's been the magic solution.
 Today, Elena was worried about Jeremy. Who swoops in and tells her to relax? Damon. And she listens.
 When Elena started feeding, who said that she could only drink blood straight from the vein?
 And when she tried to drink from animals?
 And blood bags?
 Name one vampire in the history of vampires who couldn't drink blood from a blood bag. Damon said she couldn't, so she couldn't.
 Damon likes the red dress. Elena likes the red dress.
 What if it's possible? Damon's blood made her a vampire, right?
 It's rare, but it happens. What if this is one of those times?
 What if this is really happening?
 This is a disaster!
 Yes we do! Elena is sired to Damon! Which means her one singular burning desire is to make him happy, just like Klaus and his hybrids!
 We already know it's affecting her. She's become Damon's lapdog. 
 We need to do something.
 I need to talk to Tyler, okay? Maybe he'll know what to do.
 But are you? I mean, clearly, they don't have a flat iron at hotel Salvatore. 
 Oh, creepy professor guy is just Shane now.
 I am.
 
 I talked to Tyler.
 The sire bond exists because the hybrids are grateful to Klaus for relieving them from the pain of having to wolf out every full moon, and that's why they have to turn until they're not ruled by the pain anymore. 
 Well, that's the problem. There isn't one.
 Ooh.
 I thought  
 Uh, what do you mean "thanks to Damon?"
 So where is my least-favorite Salvatore?
 Hm, so you guys check-in text now? What else do you do?
 Is that stoner tea?!
 Mm-hmm.
 
 I'll tell you why. Cooties. Think of all the germ-ridden skanks that Damon has lured into his den of enequity.
 Okay, I'm sorry. I've been good all night. I am stopping now.
 Well, say what you want about Ripper Stefan, but at least he wasn't a man slut.
 I didn't know what a sociopathic narcissist he was.
 Yeah, because he's hoping you'll sleep with him.
 You did what?!
 Don't be mad, okay? We're just looking out for you.
 Ugh, you're not falling in love with him, Elena. You're sired to him.
 I...Look, I'm sorry that it came out like that, but it's true. Damon's blood turned you. You couldn't feed from animals or blood bags because he told you so. Then he suggested that you try again with blood bags and suddenly...
 Yeah. Ask Stefan about it. He can explain it better than I can.
 It's not your fault, Elena. Okay, Damon took advantage of you.
 Come on!
 Arghh. Why are you doing this?
 I'm sorry!
 Okay, if you don't start hugging me back this is gonna get really awkward really fast.
 Oh.
 I'm a jerk. I promise to never again judge ever.
 Of course.
 Well, she saved my life. In spite of me being the nasty, bad witch.
 You feel sorry for him?
 I'm sorry I told her. Okay, I kind of didn't have a choice. All I know is he better do what he's supposed to do.
 Is that all he told you?
 Nothing. It's just 
 You're going to do what?!
 So, you're going to put him in someone else's body and then what?
 Why not just desiccate him like Bonnie did?
 Well, who was dumb enough to volunteer their body to be a Klaus sublet?
 Freak out! Freak out?! I'm about to hemorrhage! You volunteered?!
 Well, I can think of better ways for us to spend our senior year then you buried in concrete, Tyler.
 If I'm gonna be a friend in your time of need, then you to need to work on your punctuality. I'm in a crisis. Where are you?
 My boyfriend is a dumbass martyr. Wait, and why are you at your house? Aren't you trying to keep your distance from Elena?
 Klaus told you this?
 And did he happen to hand over the sword for safekeeping?
 We need to get our hands on that sword. Like today. Tyler and his hybrids are taking out Klaus tonight.
 Here to steal Tiny Tim's crutches?
 Nice snowflake, by the way.
 I'm serious. There's something...lonely about it.
 Can't. Too many adult prying eyes.
 Don't want to be a high school cautionary tale at the next town meeting.
 If we're going to be nice to each other, then I will need that glass of champagne.
 We don't have a "thing."
 Hey.
 Did you find the sword?
 What are we gonna do now?
 Stefan.
 Stefan!
 Tyler!
 Tyler, come on.
 Ugh, this is ridiculous. We are not hostages!
 I got out because even your idiot hybrids recognize the stupidity of your Alpha hybrid murder plan.
 Oh, we're going to do plenty of fighting, the second that you shove Klaus into someone else's body.
 Yeah, well I do.
 Klaus' sister, Rebekah.
 She's got a dagger in her. Stefan's been hiding her coffin in the tunnels. We dump Klaus into her body, bury her, we just killed two Original birds with one stone.
 I love you. Even when I hate you.
 Bonnie, I need you to think fast. I know that the daggers don't work on Klaus but what if we put his essence into Rebekah? It'll work, right? Say it'll work!
 Just, come on, Bonnie. Will it work?
 Uh, Bonnie Bennett, I love you!
 Elena? She's there too?
 You know what? I can't deal with this right now.
 She said it would work.
 Thank you.
 Have you seen Hayley?
 Stefan, it's me. That little werewolf slut has lost her mind. Go to the Lockwood Cellar and make sure that Rebekah's body is still there. I'm gonna find Tyler. Hayley is trying to screw this up.
 Forget everything you just saw and heard. You are Miss Mystic Falls and you have duties to fulfill.
 How come the only time April Young isn't following you around like a lost puppy is when I'm lying dead with a broken neck?
 Yeah, it's okay, I compelled her.
 Matt can't find April. I can't reach Tyler. This is a disaster.
 Is this you in crisis mode? Cause it's a lot more subtle than mine.
 Yeah, you and me both. All day I've been trying to remind myself of all the horrible things he's done.
 Yeah, you're right, Stefan. Trust is everything. Have you heard from Damon?
 Did he happen to mention where Elena was?
 What? Tyler? Tyler?
 Hey, you just missed the mandatory school assembly.
 Seriously? You decided to go on a ripper bender now?
 First of all, you weren't supposed to know that, and second of all, Tyler is already spiraling, and he gets top priority.
 I'm his girlfriend. I expect him to talk to me. Instead, he's all angry, and it doesn't help that everyone keeps referring to his mother's death as an accident, which is just a really polite way of saying she was drunk.
 Hmm, I don't think she drowned in her martini glass. Just, get it together. I can't do it alone.
 I'm only ready to talk to you if you're ready to rejoin civilization.
 If it means that you're not drinking your way through the Mystic Grill, sure.
 A cure for vampirism.
 They broke up, okay?
 Now let us go.
 What does any of this have to do with the stupid cure?
 Seriously?
 Stop.
 Vamp-running from what?
 He can't, he'll lose control!
 Tyler!
 What? No, it's not your fault.
 No...
 You're still here? What are you doing?
 Come home. Don't stoop to his level.
 Fine. You can gloat and multitask. This place is a disaster. Starting with a horrific burnt corpse.
 I will never, ever, help you.
 How delusional are you? You killed his mother. And let's not forget that we're standing in a house where Elena's aunt Jenna used to live. Or did you think that your charm would make us forget how you killed her, too? You know what? No. I am not going to engage in this. You are not even worth the calories I burn talking to you.
 Oh my god! Oh my god! 
 How? The only thing that can heal me is his blood! Oh my god...
 Get me out of here. I can't even look at him.
 It's getting worse. I'm sorry.
 No. You didn't do any of this.
 You freed them, Tyler. People put their faith in you because you're a leader. Don't forget that.
 
 How could you do this to him? To his mom? To me?
 I don't believe you.
 It's because you were hurt. Which means that there is a part of you that is human.
 Because I've seen it. Because...I've caught myself wishing that I could forget all the horrible things that you've done.
 I know that you're in love with me. And anybody capable of love is capable of being saved.
 I guess I'll never know. 
 
 Well, where's Damon in all this?
 Meaning what?
 Do you think Shane took him?
 I'm so sorry. I wish I was there to help.
 Anything. Tell me.
 Unless you get the Hunter's Sword from Klaus.
 I'll find it, don't worry. Just e-mail me photos of Jeremy's tattoo. I'll find the sword, and I'll call you back.
 Bye. 
 Nope.
 
 It's a dead language. It hasn't been used since, like, biblical times.
 What does that mean?
 Okay, this is it. We've translated all the symbols on the tattoo. 
 What does it mean? 
 
 We won't let him hurt you. Stefan and Elena will bring back the cure.
 Wait, hang on, okay? Gosh! Before you get all doomsday, just  At least let me try and talk to him.
 I'm not gonna say goodbye to you again, do you understand me? Let me fix this. 
 
 I'm not asking you to forgive him. All I'm asking is that you let him live, somewhere far from here.
 
 It doesn't matter. There's only one, so it's not like I'm gonna get it anyway.
 Then show me. You know how much I love Tyler. You can see how scared I am to lose him. If you and I are so similar, then show me your compassion. Show him the mercy that I would show you.
 Of course. 
 How many times are we gonna have to say goodbye?
 
 What if we don't? 
 Until we find a way. 
 How did you get out?
 You've done enough.
 
 How long has she been like that?
 But he's not going to wake up. She knows that, right?
 But she can't stay like that forever.
 Use the sire bond to convince her that everything is okay?
 Elena 
 Hey. I know that I'm not supposed to be calling, but something happened, and I need to talk to you, Tyler. So please call me. 
 As far away from Klaus as he can get. Klaus said he wouldn't stop until he found him.
 I just can't believe after all that, the cure is just gone.
 Well, we can't think about that right now. We need to make plans, lists. We need a funeral or a cover story, or a funeral and a cover story. I should go tell my mom. I guess she'll know what to do.
 You're right. I will do that. I will call Matt, and then I will go tell my mom, and then I will make a list or a casserole or  I don't know  whatever people are supposed to do or make in these situations. 
 Tyler, it's me again. So I was thinking about it, and you probably ditched your phone, which is the smartest thing that you could do. So I don't know when you're gonna get this, but things were looking kind of bleak for a minute, and  I don't know  maybe they're starting to turn around. So when you get this, call me back, and I'll tell you everything.
 
 They said that she knows what to do.
 What's wrong?
 To do what?
 Bonnie, you are talking like a crazy person. You are not killing 12 people, and you sure as hell can't invite every monster who has ever died back into this world.
 Bonnie, stop it. You can't just say these things.
 Do what?
 Elena? Elena, you need help finding something?
 
 Hey, it's me. Look, I hate to leave this on your voicemail, but I think that you need to know. 
 Not that anyone asked me, but I think taking her back to school is a great idea.
 Uh, blame it on your fancy water filters. Your house has the only vervain-free showers in town.
 Yeah, my mom says it's about to get worse, so she could use a little help.
 Hey, Tyler. It's me checking in. Things are just getting back to normal here, sort of. Elena's not quite there, but we're working on it. 
 Yeah, I called her last night. She's fine. She's just a little drained from, you know, everything.
 Yeah.
 I mean, technically, yeah. I'm captain, but I thought you hated cheerleading.
 
 The uniform still fits. You look fantastic. 
 Wow. The competition's bigger than last year.
 I'm gonna go stretch.
 Hey, where were you? We're going on any minute.
 What's with the ribbon? That's not even our colors.
 Are you out of your mind?
 
 Remember how Damon sired her to behave? It didn't really work.
 No way. You are not cheering.
 I got here as soon as I could. This is insane.
 We can't compel them to leave. The locals are all on vervain from the town water supply.
 So what do we do?
 Great. And where is she?
 I almost forgot what that looked like.
 
 Well, your sober coach is giving you the green light. 
 Just take your own advice. Have fun, you know? We deserve a little bit of fun.
 
 Come on, Elena. Just dance with us.
 Mom!
 
 Elena! Where the hell is she?
 I can't believe she's doing this. I mean, she hurt my mom, Stefan.
 
 Elena! Don't make me fight you, Elena! I'm stronger than you, and I don't want to hurt you.
 
 
 Hey, Tyler. It's me. You'll never believe the crazy day I've had. Look, I know that you said you wouldn't, but I really wish that you would answer. It'd be great to talk to you.
 You mean besides the fact that my best friend tried to kill me?
 So how do we get her back? Or what if we can't? Why would she choose to turn her emotions back on? She's an orphan. She just lost her brother. Her life sucks, Stefan. So why would she come back to us?
 Matt?
 Matt, why can't I get inside?
 Matt, what's going on?
 He's not coming back.
 
 
 I know where he's not  with me. And he gave Matt the deed to the house, so he's gone for good.
 Oh I can, and I do. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to spiraling, so go away.
 That means every werewolf, every witch, every vampire. I wonder how many of those you personally killed. Care yet?
 What are we even looking for?
 Where, on his evil villain to-do list? 'Steal blood, perform 3 massacres, pick up dry cleaning'?
 
 
 
 
 There've been two massacres. Pastor Young's farm is here, and the old Lockwood cellar, where you spitefully slaughtered 12 of your own hybrids, is here. 
 
 
 I just want to see where we are.
 Yeah? And leave Bonnie's life in your hands? Fat chance. Do you even know how to read a map?
 
 It's because it's not true! There is no allure to darkness.
 I did once, when I thought he was worth it, but it turns out some people can't be fixed. People who do terrible things are just terrible people.
 Klaus, we need to save her.
 
 You were just gonna let Bonnie die.
 
 
 Klaus, we need to talk. 
 Oh my god, Klaus, that could kill you.
 Hey. As much as I would love to watch you die, you still haven't found me that cure.
 
 Klaus? Where are you?
 What happened to you?
 I'm hounding you? I'm supposed to be running three different prom committees right now and you keep phone stalking me.
 Okay, I don't know if this is some new way of flirting, but it sucks, and I have more important things to do.
 Why would Silas attack you?
 
 What do you want me to do?
 Oh, my god. You do have a heart.
 Oh, my bad. It's just a bloody rib.
 Ugh, I swear there's nothing in here. And if you think I'm having fun, you're insane.
 Well, you thought wrong.
 I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know what? 
 Your word first.
 
 Because you put it in danger...twice. Why can't you just do something decent for once?
 We've all tried to kill you. 
 
 
 What?
 If Silas can make you, of all people, believe that you're dying...what can he do to the rest of us?
 I used all your bleach.
 Yeah. 
 Are you gonna let Tyler come back into town?
 What kind of dreams?
 Well, you never got to say goodbye, Bon. You're grieving, that's normal.
 Oh.
 No, it's because you need a night off from mourning. And I'm gonna make sure that you have it.
 You think?
 
 You know what, I love friend-prom. And it's exactly what prom should be  friends and memories.
 Yes, it sucks that my boyfriend can't be here, but the three of us are gonna have the night of our lives.
 I know. You helped me pick it out months ago when we were friends  before you tried to kill me.
 
 Klaus? Klaus?? Kl 
 Hello? Did you not hear me?
 Well, I'm sorry that you're having personal issues, but I have a real crisis on my hands. Elena stole my prom dress!
 I went to pick it up and the tailor said that somebody else already did. And when I asked who, she said she couldn't remember. 
 It is not funny.
 Then stop laughing! Look, I know that prom isn't important to you, but it's important to me.
 
 Are you kidding me? You look like a back-stabbing bi 
 The dress is beautiful, and it brings out your eyes.
 I know you said to kill her with kindness, but can't I just kill her?
 It's from Klaus.
 Don't ask.
 If I had Klaus wrapped around my finger, then I would be here with Tyler right now. Are you making any progress with the dress thief?
 What do you mean?
 That's normal, Stefan. You guys were in love, and that doesn't go away just because you declare that you're moving on.
 I don't know. I think that someday, you'll meet someone new and you'll fall madly in love, and you'll have moved on without even realizing it.
 Aren't you on "Save Elena" duty?
 This prom sucks. This is our last dance together, and it's awful. This is not how I wanted to remember this night.
 Thank you.
 If anyone asks, I'll be at the after-party.
 Tyler.
 Oh, my god. Tyler.
 Oh, you can't be here. Klaus 
 If Klaus finds out 
 I know. I know. 
 Elena, you're here. I got valedictorian! You can help me write my speech.
 Come on, we're graduating this year, this is it! We need to soak up every second before-
 Where is she? I wanna see her.
 She's been here for days. She hasn't improved at all?
 You said that you knew how to help her.
 What, how? By torturing her?
 Let me talk to her. Before any more interventioning. If she's weak, she can't hurt me. Please, just let me try.
 I brought you something. It doesn't have any vervain in it, I swear. I just figured a little blood might help you think straight.
 For the record, I don't agree with what they're doing. I mean, I agree that you need to turn your humanity back on, but I don't think that making you suffer is the way to do it. That's not who you are.
 Because we've been friends forever.
 I am not going to give up on you.
 You're in pain, you're lashing out, I get it. But you can't stay this way forever. We're about to graduate, and start new lives! And you deserve-
 Elena.
 Do whatever you have to do. 
 Bonnie! Where have you been? I've left, like, ninety million messages.
 Ugh, don't remind me. Look, this whole thing with Elena...it's about to get brutal, and I know that she's not your favorite person right now, but I could really use you over here.
 Moral support! And maybe just a tiny check-in to make sure that Silas isn't playing any more pesky little mind games with you.
 We have to keep talking. If we don't keep talking, then I won't be able to stop myself from listening in, and I can't stand to hear Elena in pain.
 I don't know. Anything. 
 I just figured that you'd forget, so I ordered yours when I ordered mine. And I got one for Elena, too.
 What the hell is she doing here?
 Yeah, we can't really entertain right now, but thanks for stopping by.
 You're failing? Wh-why didn't you ask me to help you study?
 Well, what classes are you failing?
 Matt!
 We don't have a motto. 
 Who's there?
 Oh, my god.
 Everyone said that you were gone for good.
 You don't owe me an explanation. You're moving on  by all means, go.
 You! I'm afraid of you.
 How do you know what Elena said to me in that cell?
 Silas.
 Matt, we have to get out of here.
 No, it's not okay. Silas is out there and he made me think that it was Klaus 
 He's trying to get to Bonnie. Do you know where Bonnie is?
 Mom, I need you to get home and lock all the doors right now.
 Don't let anyone inside  not even me because I have a key so I can let myself in. Do you understand?
 Just do it, okay? I'm on my way.
 Bonnie, why aren't you answering? Silas isn't going to just give up. You're the only one that can stop him. Call me.
 Mom, don't come any closer. Stop.
 I don't know how to tell if it's really you. What if this is another trick? He can get in my head, and he would've known that I called you...
 Bonnie hasn't called back yet. I just don't understand why she hasn't called.
 There you are.
 I've been calling you for hours.
 How do I know it's you? Silas keeps getting in my head, attacking me. He says he wants to know where you are, he threatened my mother.
 Mom, just stay there.
 Oh, my god.
 Mom? 
 Oh, god. Please. Please, please, please...Mom.
 Come on. Come on, open your eyes, Mom. You need my blood in your system, come on, Mom! Please Mom, wake up! Mommy! Mom!
 Okay, this'll work.
 Mom? Mom? Open your eyes. Come on, wake up! You have to wake up! You have to see me graduate! 
 Mom! Are you okay?
 Stamp, please.
 Thank you.
 You're done? I'm only on my second batch.
 I know that's how you feel now, but once you get through this hating Katherine phase 
 No. Why would I know where she is?
 
 I don't, Elena. Chill.
 Is it supposed to rain tonight?
 Well, someone needs to do something, before she explodes.
 What about us? Are we still friends? All those things you said when your humanity was off - is that how you really feel?
 Well, what about when you said, and I quote, "You're a repulsive, bloodsucking control-freak monster"? Did you really mean those things?
 
 I searched the whole school. She should be here.
 What was that?
 Ugh. It just doesn't make any sense. This is the center of the triangle. If she's gonna do the spell, she has to do it here. This is where they should be.
 Then unlink her. You go, I'll stay with Bonnie.
 
 I need to bleed. Silas wants me to bleed.
 Just let me do this. I need to do this.
 Let go of me!
 Let me go!
 I need to keep cutting, I need to keep cutting, I need to keep cutting...
 I 
 Bitch!
 Good, you're here. We need to celebrate.
 What's wrong with you? Silas is dead, or whatever, and you're just sitting here like a bump on a log.
 A snag? A snag is a bad yearbook picture. You hit a tsunami. Where are you?
 Are you telling me that we might graduate right smack in the middle of a ghost-filled Expression Triangle?
 No, we are not going to cancel. Graduation is the most important event of our lives, the last ceremony of our youth. It is our rite of freaking passage! Hell will freeze over before I let anyone cancel graduation.
 Just promise me that today is a friend day.
 I love you, too.
 Klaus, now is not the time to decide that you are over me. I'm gonna call you every ten minutes until you get your ass here to save Damon's life.
 Where is everyone?
 Where have you been?
 I can't believe it. We're actually all here. We are all here together! Bonnie Bennett, are you crying?
 Before we go off to college.
 Well, the perks of being a vampire – we can go wherever we wanna go. We can choose our own roommates. We could – we could get a triple room!
 Aw – group hug!
 Oh, get over yourself!
 Thank you.
 How'd you get here so fast?
 That, or a mini fridge.
 What?
 
 You're dreaming about Stefan?
 So he can hear how happy you are with Damon? Absolutely not. He'll call you when he's ready.
 Okay, Elena, that pit is called guilt. You feel terrible because you broke Stefan's heart, and that nagging feeling is your brain waking up to tell you that you've made a horrible, yet completely reversible mistake.
 It doesn't mean he hasn't been thinking about you shacking up with his brother all summer long.
 We actually made it. We're here!
 Small appliances, by the fridge.
 Mom, we'll be fine.
 Okay, go! Before I change my mind and make you stay.
 Well, I couldn't agree more...roomie.
 To the next chapter in our lives.
 Uh, who are you?
 Absolutely not!
 I do. His name's Tyler. He had to miss move-in day, but he'll be here for the first day of classes.
 Speaking of minding one's own business, let's talk roommate ground rules. Privacy is very important to me.
 I have low blood sugar. My diet's finicky, so keep your paws off my stuff.
 And if I suddenly get up to leave or disappear for a while, don't follow me or look for me.
 Did you notice how Megan's juicer takes up all the small appliance space? She has an entire drawer dedicated to organic linen.
 Maybe if she didn't take such long showers, I wouldn't have time to go through her stuff. How are you okay with a third roommate?
 We also need personal space. I mean, what if we suddenly get a craving, and I want to eat her? Or our blood bags go bad because we can't store them in the mini-fridge? Ugh, and what the hell is protein water?
 You know what, maybe if I drink it all, she'll wanna move out.
 Vervain.
 
 She knows who we are – she drinks vervain water!
 Seriously? We share a bathroom with this girl! What if she's a hunter, and she stakes us when we're in the shower? Or she steals our daylight rings while we're asleep and then we burst into flames when the sun comes up?!
 I think we should lock her up. You know, let the vervain get out of her system, and then we compel her to forget about us.
 Such as?
 Hi.
 I'm with Tyler.
 From the mountains of Appalachia?
 Did you tell Damon you were having dreams about Stefan?
 See? No relationship is perfect.
 What the hell?
 Waiting for someone.
 So.
 Like I said, she knows.
 Okay, it's settled. When she leaves, we grab her.
 Elena, she saw us stuck at the threshold, we might as well have flashed her our fangs.
 Maybe it wasn't random.
 Megan, can you hear me? Get outside and we can help you.
 Who did this to her?
 We don't know what she knew or who she told. We should get out of here.
 Don't worry, I took her phone.
 Do they know what happened?
 You think this was a suicide?
 No.
 Delete.
 Megan's tablet's gone.
 It just doesn't make any sense. First, the roommate we're not supposed to have might know about vampires, and then happens to be killed by a vampire, and now the school's covering it up? Seriously, who is this girl?
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
 I'm really glad that you're here.
 "We're here."
 Ugh, college kids are so dramatic. She was on campus for, like, one day. She couldn't have made that many friends.
 Sorry, I'm in a mood.
 He's deferring from enrolling and deferring from returning my phone calls, so I'm deferring from having sex with him ever again.
 No.
 Dr. Wesley Maxfield.
 Applied — what, what? Uh, Elena, we are supposed to be taking Intro to Communication. What happened to getting drunk and making bad decisions about boys? What happened to our fun freshman year at college? I am supposed to be a drama major!
 What? I love — 
 Creep-y.
 Damon! Towel, knock!
 I don't know. She probably went to the bonfire to get more intel on our weirdo professor.
 I thought that Stefan dropped his body in the quarry...
 Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Elena was right. All summer, she's had this pit in her stomach about Stefan.
 I don't know. She just said that she had this weird feeling that something was wrong with him.
 Why would Silas want to hurt her?
 You know, if you just would've told the truth, all of this could've been avoided.
 Forget all this and get out of here.
 You have to calm down.
 Seriously? That's Jesse. I kind of liked him.
 Sorry, this was all I could find out there.
 Sorry my friend went aggro. He's got anger issues.
 I have a boyfriend.
 Well, he was supposed to be here. He deferred a semester. You don't have to say anything, I know how these things go — people go to school and they drift apart.
 Exactly. Sometimes they don't.
 Yes! Yes.
 Oh, my god. Ugh. I am so sorry.
 I think we need to set some ground rules for when boyfriends come to visit.
 Just call me the minute you hear from Bonnie, okay? I've left her, like, a hundred messages.
 You're gonna find him, Elena.
 Bye.
 Ugh, college kids are so dramatic. She was on campus for like one day, she couldn't have made that many friends.
 Sorry, I'm in a mood.
 He's deferring from enrolling and deferring from returning my phone calls, so I'm deferring from having sex with him ever again.
 No.
 What did he say exactly?
 Means that they probably devoured a troop of Girls Scouts by now.
 I'm kidding...kind of. Although it's not uncommon for patients with retrograde amnesia or other traumatic brain injuries to turn volatile.
 It's possible I studied up on my chem, biochem, applied microbio, molecular bio, and Grey's Anatomy—the real one and the television show.
 Of course I did. I'm also trying to impress Dr. Maxfield. I figured if I could get closer to him, i.e. into his biology class, maybe I could figure out why he covered up our roommate's murder by vampire, and it's also possible that I have a study buddy.
 Hi, Dr. Maxfield. Are you ready to go study, Jesse?
 I'm dragging him to our hometown graveyard bell-ringing ceremony.
 As in a study date. While I'm there, I might as well ring a bell for Tyler and me considering our relationship is on its death bed.
 
 
 Togavirus causes congenital rubella, whatever that is.
 A theory often used to explain the contradictory relationship between predator and prey.
 Fear of extinction. 
 Well, whenever anyone tells me I can't do something, I prove them wrong.
 I don't know where my boyfriend is. That would require communication and mutual interest and respect, and I invited you here because you're smart and you're nice, and I don't know, I just kind of wanted to hang out with you today.
 What?
 Aplastic anemia...
 Stefan?
 What, you recognize me?
 Yeah. Yeah. I can see that. Are you okay?
 
 Stefan! 
 Look. I know that you're hungry, but you don't do people, okay? It just—it doesn't end well.
 Yes. In the car. Come with me.
 Hey! Stefan, stop!
 This isn't you, okay? You might not remember, but I do. You are better than this. You are not this person.
 What?
 Stefan.
 Oh, my God. 
 Hey. How you feeling?
 It's Bonnie. My friend, our friend. She's dead.
 Please don't ask because then I'm going to have to try to come up with an answer, which means I'm gonna have to actually think about it, and then I'll start crying, and I'm afraid that I might not ever be able to stop.
 I don't know. Part of me just wishes that I could trade places with you because without all the memories, maybe it wouldn't hurt so damn much.
 It's not. I'm never gonna see her again, and I have no idea where Tyler is, and I just got so used to them being there all the time, and now what? I'm supposed to just learn to move on without them? How do I do that when all I have is this sadness and this anger and–
 Oh, before I forget, I talked to the registrar, and your major is   drum roll   sociology...
 And I compelled you a single.
 
 Well, lucky for you, I figured out a way for you to make up for it.
 Ha, ha, ha! You are escorting me to the Whitmore Historical Ball.
 It's the one time a year were they put their whole collection on display, and everyone dresses up as famous historical figures. I got Stefan a costume. Even he's going. Come on, Tyler. I mean, how cute will we be as Bonnie and Clyde?
 You're right. Let's not talk.
 I may have e-mailed them a few suggestions.
 Well, considering the crowd, I'll take that as a compliment.
 
 Hey, you want to get out of here? These costumes come with handcuffs, and you have a single.
 I know. It's just...a happy by-product of us being in school together.
 What?
 Hey...Here you are. 
 Yeah. I completely understand. I have been pushing way too hard, and, you know, you need to make your own decisions. Point is, you're back, and we're together. 
 I see. So, this is about Klaus.
 You haven't even given it a chance.
 
 You know what, Tyler? For someone who hates Klaus, you certainly sound a lot like him.
 
 Wait. I've been thinking about it, and I've decided that...I'm not going to have this conversation again. I can't just sit here while I'm waiting for you to come back.
 Then stay! Just be the love of my life. Just love me more than you hate him.
 No. No. No! Don't you dare walk away from me! I swear to God, Tyler, if you take one more step, we are done, okay? No more surprises, no more excuses, no more chances. We are done.
 I don't want to know if Tyler called, so don't even tell me. So, do you want to do small appliances, or toiletries?
 I mean, I'd compel a cute boy to do it for us, but I don't think I want to see a cute boy ever again. Except for Jesse, who's conveniently not answering his phone.
 Hello? Dr. Maxfield thinks we're vampires, you know, threatened to expose us, told us to drop out.
 What the hell are you doing in my dorm, Katherine?
 What? I loathe you.
 Aw. And how is any of this my problem?
 Dr. Maxfield. He teaches bio.
 What did you inject him with?
 We're draining vervain blood out of your system so I can compel you to forget that Elena and I are vampires.
 Shhh. 
 ...then, carry the 1...
 Perfect! 4.7 pints. 
 Oh, my God, it's totally working! 
 Who's "they"? The people you want to expose us to? That secret society thingy that you belong to?
 Sorry. I spaced.
 You know what? I just broke up with my boyfriend for good. My heart is in pieces. sue me for having a moment.
 Yes. It is. Now answer my questions truthfully.
 What is the secret society?
 Augustine? I've never heard of it.
 How do you become a member?
 And what is your extraordinary talent?
 Not to mention that you're willing to lie on autopsy reports like my roommate's! You knew she was killed by a vampire. Is that why you covered up her death?
 Hang on. Okay. So, your creepy elitist society also has their own vampire. Who is it?
 You were wrong. Elena Gilbert and I are not vampires, we're just regular freshmen. You're light-headed because you just gave blood this morning. Forget everything that happened here.
 Hey, Jesse. You missed our study session again. Where are you? Look. I'm really worried. Just call me. 
 Um, I'm sorry?
 And who are you?
 What? You went into my room?
 Great. Even Katherine's friends are bitches.
 Um, how do you two know each other?
 Okay. Whatever.
 Sorry to interrupt the world's weirdest lunch, but, you with the doppelgänger blood, duty calls.
 
 Katherine? What are you doing?
 Here. Heal.
 What's wrong?
 Please tell me this is real.
 Oh my god, oh my god! And we can be roommates, 'cause we have that extra bed, and we can clear out half the closet–
 I'm sorry, I just—I can't believe you're really here!
 Hey...Umm, now that Bonnie's back–
 Thank you, for what you did today.
 Yes, you did, and yes, we do.
 Mother-daughter? She's your....Oh. Wow.
 "Yeah, I'm this supernatural anchor that connects the two worlds together, so..."
 Which equals a massive cause for celebration!
 And given that mine went radio silent after he kissed me, and yours was last seen at a tea party for a vampire-hating secret society.
 With Jell-O shots.
 Funny. That sentiment implies that Damon is actually coming.
 What happened, Jesse?
 Okay...I'm coming, but what's going on?
 What kind of experiments?
 You're going to call them and  tell them that you lost your phone, but you're okay. Where's Wes now?
 Well, you're new and you're hungry.
 He's alright. He's alive.
 Elena, wait. I was thinking that Jesse could do it. 
 Yep. I've been teaching him the art of sublimating vampire hunger via grain alcohol.
 You realize that Damon's going to kill Wes, right?
 You realize you're wrong, right?
 No. No. It's fine.  I'm fine with you two being together, as long as you can acknowledge the kind of person you are with.
 That's one of the other fun side effects. Everything is heightened.
 Nope.
 What?
 Ow! You bit me.
 Hey. You okay?
 Jesse...
 Hey. Have you seen Jesse?
 Wait. Where are you going?
 No! No!
 No, Jesse! Jesse, come here. Hold on. Hold on. Just stay with me, please. Jesse, just stay with me, please. 
 But we promised that we would help him.
 Yeah. Me, too. Because the Elena that I used to know would have given Jesse a chance.
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I said earlier. It was out of line. It just sucks, you know, cause Jesse was one of the good ones.
 I believe you, okay? I believe you want to celebrate the fact that we can go to school and function like regular freshmen. I get that. I want that, too, but, Elena, when are you gonna figure out that the outside world is not nearly as dangerous as the person you're inviting into your own bedroom?
 The day that I stop telling you is the day that we're no longer best friends, and I hope that day never comes.
 I'm your sober sponsor, and I heard that you needed help.
 And I got my Mom to drop off something for us to use.
 Don't worry. I sanitized it.
 I was thinking it's time for you to deal with the source of your PTSD.
 
 No. Elena did what she thought she had to do, just like she also thought 
 
 
 Let me find it.
 
 Oh, my god! Katherine, seriously? 
 We are friends.
 Oh, God. I am so not listening to this. 
 
 I know it's a little extreme, but the baby steps approach wasn't working.
 
 It was so quiet, I got worried.
 
 A little help here! I mean, I know I'm a vampire, but this thing is really heavy! 
 Hey, Elena. I'm probably going to stay at my Mom's tonight. I think I am officially homesick. So I'll let you know when I'm  
 
 Okay. Time to wake up, sleepy head.
 This is your breakup breakfast!
 As she should! He did say, and I quote, "I'm a bad person. I am bad for you. And I'm choosing to let you go."
 Of course I did.
 Drink this.
 Yeah.
 It's Stefan.
 
 Tyler's werewolf curse got triggered because of her.
 She did kill me...Although I'm weirdly better off.
 Oh my...I forgot to tell you. You were kidnapped and hostaged and...
 Hello? Is no one going to comment on the fact that Stefan slept with Katherine? I mean, that's kind of a big deal.
 Bonnie Bennett! Wait, did you two...
 And you didn't tell me?!
 Of course you were obligated! You're my best friend! Oh my god. Does Elena know that her little brother...
 Oh, scandalous sex! Even better! God, how am I the only person on this planet that isn't having scandelous sex?
 Good idea. We'll cover more ground that way.
 We'll cover more ground that way.
 Klaus..
 Sorry. Matt's buried alive. No time to chat.
 I literally just wooshed at the sight of your face, so no.
 So, you're here to gloat over her corpse-to-be? Delight in the closure of five hundred years of revenge. Great. I'm even less interested.
 Is he...Did you...
 Because I made him choose. Me, or his stupid revenge fantasy. He chose wrong. I suggest that you learn from his mistake and let Katherine die in peace. Dying sucks enough as it is...no need to rub anyone's nose in it.
 Matt!! MATT!
 What?
 I don't know what you mean.
 You can't do this to me. You can't just show up while my friend is missing and is in danger.
 Where?
 Don't you have a dying girl you need to go punish for her sins?
 And what is that?
 My confession? I didn't do anything. Confession about what?
 I'm in college. I'm building a life for myself. I have plans; and a future; and things that I want and none of those things involve you. Okay. None of them.
 No you don't. Yes, I do cover our connection with hostility, 'cause yes, I hate myself for the truth. So if you promise to walk away...like you said, and never come back. Then yes...I will be honest with you. I will be honest with you about what I want.
 Good.
 Hey.
 So, what are we doing?
 Tyler?
 It's open!
 Yeah, you know...all those stressogens. I'm stress-cleaning. I'm stress. So I'm cleaning. Boy drama. Not that you care....
 Well I can give her a message.
 So no more vampire experiments?
 I will.
 You WHAT?
 Look. I would love to help; IF I thought he was actually good for her, but I don't...
 What? Do you know something?
 but If I wanted to help, she's not here. I thought that she was with you.
 Okay.. that's weird.. um.. Well, where the hell is she?
 Okay. So Bonnie took Jeremy to go visit her mom and neither of them have talked to Elena.
 Well..... nobody is perfect.
 I can be unpredictable and incredibly reckless.
 I did a bad thing..
 You don't even know what it is!
 Elena, stop! This is really important!
 What would you say if I told you that when a certain awful person was in town, I ran into him in the woods and sort of kissed him. He was there and obviously wanted to kiss me, so I thought "we'll just make out," but then, it felt really good to kiss him, so then I kind of, totally had sex with him, but I swear, I didn't plan to do it. Now, I feel terrible
 Klaus....
 Would I make something like this up? And that is why I need you to tell me what an awful person I am.
 Elena Gilbert!
 I am so not answering that.
 Just let me explain.
 Yeah. Well, I couldn't find a rock big enough to crawl under.. So.
 You're my friend. I need you to just give it to me straight. Am I a horrible person?
 Honestly, I thought "eww."
 Or maybe, I came here because I know that you see the best in people.
 So we all agree? No more moping about life's little failures and no more dabbling the dark arts of boyfriends past. This is a fresh start. (She turns around to face them.)
 No one likes a bragger, Bonnie.
 Today is the dawning of a new era. This is stage one of our metamorphosis into the land of the brave, the free, and the single.
 Bonnie's best friends are single, which makes her single adjacent. So she can be our wingwoman. (She pulls out a flyer and gives it to Katherine.)
 No. This is our purge, our cleanse. This is where we rid ourselves from the baggage better known as our tragic and mortifying first semester.
 Bonnie!
 Bonnie, you in?
 Since when does Elena Gilbert accessorize?
 Look. You're not fooling anyone. I know that you're faking it.
 Please. It is so obvious. I appreciate it, I do, but you know I'm on edge because of the whole Tyler-Klaus thing, so you are pretending that breaking up with Damon was no big deal. (Katherine looks relieved.)
 Look, Elena. You don't have to pretend with me, and if you don't want to go tonight, it's all good. I can be bitter, party of one.
 Thank you.
 Hey!
 Do you mind if I borrow her for a minute? She promised me that she'd join me at the shredding station.
 Thanks!
 Did you bring anything to shred?
 Almost.
 No. Klaus did.
 Yes. I am making a decision. These relationships are over.
 And I'm not going to change my mind just because I'm feeling bored or nostalgic or lonely.
 I'm just saying that you've been through a lot lately, and your emotions are all over the place. So are Stefan's. I think that making yourself so available could maybe be confusing things.
 No. I didn't say that. I just I ugh. Just forget it. Just just forget everything I said.
 Hey.
 Come on. You can be bitter with me.
 Okay. Then what are you not telling Elena?
 You came to a dance of your own free will. Something is up.
 Uh. What do you mean exactly by 'deep end?'
 He  what?
 You think if you tell her what he did that she'll give up on him forever?
 Bonnie, what's going on?
 You're going to help my friend. Do I need to say it slower?
 For a newbie witch to learn a complicated spell under massive stress? I have no idea. Bonnie?
 What are you doing? Damon, call him back right and you tell him to stop.
 Damon! CALL HIM BACK.
 You were right. He's off the rails. This is from my mom.
 Check and check, but there's something else. All of the victims were found inside their homes without their head... and their skin was desiccated.
 No. Uh uh. No, You are not turning Damon's roosting chickens into a Stefan Salvatore guilt trip. No one could've stopped him from going after Wes the other night.
 Ah. Good news, bad news. Bad news is that when this happened to Jesse, we had to kill him, but the good news is... I'm sorry, usually there's some good news.
 Elena, hey! I didn't know that you were here.
 Oh. Stefan who doesn't go to college.
 Uh-huh.
 No. Why?
 Do you think that he's in trouble?
 Okay. Well, I'll come right over..
 No, I know, I think that we can figure this out together. I'll see you soon.
 No. No. You deal with Damon. We can handle this. Besides, it's time we move into the next phase of our post-break-up, pre-friendship relationship timeline.
 Come on, Stefan! First, she tells you she's going to fight to get Damon back and then she re-breaks up with him and now she's here, with you, her ex "studying."
 Well, look, I'm just saying that Elena and Damon's break-up is messy and you are not messy.  You're stable and sane and...
 Thank you. mm.. good coffee. Although I usually take mine with a little more awkward silence.
 SO, Matt. Um, he's missing?
 Matt?
 Okay, Rewind, start over. This whole time, you've been with Nadia?
 First night where?
 Yes because she's compelling you!
 Where have you been the last two days.
 Fun? Oh come on! Just like the time when she buried you alive. WOOAHH. Pop open the champagne.
 and what the hell is that supposed to mean?
 She's just trying to get under our skin to distract us.
 You're not seriously buying all of this?
 Going somewhere?
 Matt! Are you okay?
 You texted me from Nadia's phone.
 What are you doing to him! Tell me!
 Look. We can get past this together. Okay. I just want us to be good again, you know?
 Of course. Obviously. I mean, Rome wasn't built in a day.
 Okay. You made your point.
 Understood.
 Ahh.. About one and half of these ago.
 You were right. I brought this on myself. I knew the Klaus thing was gonna come with consequences. Guess now I just have to deal with it and learn from my mistakes.
 Yes, and Tyler was right. Nadia's been compelling him to forget things.
 Who knows? He tried to message me, but Nadia stopped him.
 "Help. K" was all I got.
 So... You and Elena. What's the verdict?
 Excuse me?
 Woah, woah, woah, woah. You guys got a hotel room? With a shower?
 Yeah, but she could?! I just.. I don't get it. She knows that this would destroy him, what does... what is she doing?
 No. I mean, she may be mad at him, but she would never want him dead.
 Yeah, but that didn't happen because Katherine had a change of heart. No... No. You don't think that... It's impossible that she'd be... We would have noticed! It's Elena. We know her... Oh my God...
 Remember that time Nadia's ex, Gregor, hitched a ride in your head? Yeah, well, it's kind of the same thing. Katherine is a passenger in Elena, except it's worse, because none of us seemed to notice!
 Because it's Katherine and she's smart, and conniving, and sneaky... and we're the worst friends ever.
 I was sleeping three feet away from her! She picked out my Bitter Ball dress. And I let her use my toothpaste!
 Of course! Oh my god!
 Wait, you guys! This is Katherine we're talking about. She's going to see a sneak attack from a mile away. We've got to get her to come to us. Get her guard down, corner her.
 Hey guys! Focus. Tyler's right. Katherine's not going to leave Nadia's side, unless not leaving compromises her identity.
 We've got to invite her to something that Elena can't say no to.
 ' Of course she does! So when can you get over to Stefan's to help us set up?
 You can't?
 
 Of course. The farther she gets, the worse our chances of ever seeing Elena again. It's bad enough that we didn't recognize Katherine, we also blew our only advantage.
 Hey ready for the changing of the...
 
 
 Hey, don't, don't.
 
 Is it wrong that I feel...
 Sad. I know that Katherine is a horrible person but...
 You mean Klaus. Because I saw the good in Klaus.
 Your hybrid bite just killed someone and no one even batted an eye. I sleep with the wrong guy weeks ago and I don't hear the end of it. How is that fair?
 Why? Because "being good" comes so easy to me? Well guess what, Tyler, it doesn't! I am a vampire. I have the same impulses as you. So I'm allowed to make some mistakes along the way. Yes, I slept with Klaus. But after you walked away from me. That was my choice and I'm living with it, and I don't need to be hearing about it every five seconds. So, just get over it or get out of my life, but I'm done feeling guilty.
 Having fun, obviously!
 The Enzo...
 Ha. Alright, other Enzo. I don't know what it is you're doing here, but I don't want any part of it.
 Why? You want your killing buddy back? Is killing innocent people not as much fun when you're alone?
 Ugh. Just stay out of it. We don't need any more problems.
 Dr. Creepenstein was working on the next phase of the virus. When Nadia was sick, he was experimenting on her blood and he figured out a way to extract werewolf venom from her blood and put it in the virus.
 Hello! You don't think I would just drop this on you without a silver lining! There's an antidote. It just requires you to come meet me. I'll text you the address.
 No. You have to go there. And don't ask me why, because I can't tell you.
 If I could tell you, don't you think I'd be there right now to help Elena? I'll text you the address!
 The travelers don't want anyone to know what they're up to, and by "anyone," I mean "newbie, emo, witch" types, with bad attitudes. Just get there fast, okay?
 When?
 Killing someone in cold blood isn't casual, but Damon managed that just fine.
 Okay. We're here. Where is the antidote?
 What does that have to do with us?
 I'm sorry, and you do?
 Special? How?
 Why?
 Look, I know there's a lot of them, but between you, me and Enzo, I bet we can take em.
 Ugh. Sorry. I'm desperate.
 Yeah, until you lose your memory again.
 Who volunteers themselves for witchy electric shock therapy?
 I'll kill them..
 No. I'm going to stay with Stefan.
 Why is this taking so long?
 Good! That's great! You found him!
 You said you know where he is! What are you doing?
 You're pushing him too hard! he's going to lose everything. Stop!
 Tell them to stop. There's a way we can all get what we want.
 Hey.
 Oh my god...
 It was funnier the first time!
 Sloan was going to fry your brain to kill your.. other you. I wsn't about to let that happen, so.. I may have volunteered to help Enzo deal with it.
 They only want one alive, remember? It's you or him.
 I'll be fine, Stefan. Besides, you'd do the same for me, right?
 Don't worry. I don't either. I'll be safe, I promise.
 She saw him?
 Well, I don't fail at things. So do it again and I'll kill you too.
 So, the receptionist doesn't know Tom personally, but I compelled him to call someone who does.
 Well why can't it be both?
 Yeah, well that doesn't mean I trust you. I still don't understand why you're even here.
 Dear God. Please don't tell me that I am the real reason you're here.
 Mhmm. Arrogant, tactless, completely unable to take a hint.
 You mean, she tortured you? I can definitely relate to that.
 And let me guess, she made you want to be a better man.
 Yes. We need to see him as soon as possible. It's a matter of life or death.
 Your stupid doppel-visions gave us bad information. Put Stefan on the phone.
 Tom's been missing from the hospital for months. Is there any other things that you noticed in your visions   any small details that could maybe help us out?
 No. No No. If he's blacking out, that means that the link is destroying his memories.
 Stefan, I'm still here , okay? Listen to my voice. Can you hear me? I'm right here, okay? Just hold on.
 Can you hear me? Just say something, please!
 Thank you. I won't let you down.
 These look old. Like, four months old.
 Red hair.. that's her. She's a witch.
 And she must own the house.
 Why did you do that? She was our only lead!
 You don't think that I'm up for this?
 I'm sorry, is this all supposed to be easy? You barely know me, so let me reintroduce myself. Hi., my name is Caroline Forbes and I am a good vampire, and I don't just go around killing people!
 Well, last time I checked, this isn't war and I'm not a soldier, but Stefan is one of the best people that I know and when it comes to saving his life, yes, I will do just about anything–
 What's that sound?
 Four months ago, Silas died. The original Stefan-gänger.
 Tom? Tom? Tom Avery?
 No! I'm the one who made the deal. This is on me, no matter what.
 Let me do this my way.
 Good. Now, I promise, you won't feel a thing.
 I'm getting you out of here.
 She kidnapped you that night.. locked you up ever since   hid you away from anyone that knew magic.
 Yeah.
 It's because I compelled you to. And to stay calm and not worry.
 I just want to make sure you're a good guy.. no skeletons in the closet.. that sort of thing.
 And.. you are just about one of the nicest people I've ever met.
 Ugh. Em. What I need from you isn't something I can take.
 Well, you don't have to. You just remind me of someone who's really important to me.
 Yeah. So are you because after this, you are going to get on a train, ride until you find a place you like; meet a pretty girl; settle down; be happy for the rest of your long, long life.
 Just go easy on the carbs. They're a killer.
 Yeah. I don't think anyone has.
 No!
 Why the hell did you do that?!
 Well, if she's anything like me, she just lost all respect for you.
 Stefan? Hey.
 A big fat failure? Yep. But on the bright side, I'm also exhausted and very cranky.
 I just did. I failed. I couldn't kill him, Stefan. Not even to save you.
 No, I'm feeling guilty because you're still being held prisoner.
 Well, you're even more important now. Enzo killed Tom.
 I should've seen it coming. That whole flirty "oh, I'm so charming because I want to distract you" thing. I-I practically invented that. What do we do now?
 That's heroic.
 Shut up! Ha ha. That's very funny.
 You knew? That's why you let me go, because you knew the whole time, didn't you?
 That I couldn't do it.
 How?
 What the hell is that?
 Oh my god.
 You ok?
 Well, I guess my mom's not here yet. I'm gonna get us some coffees.
 Uh, you walked. Hang on. Did you just have one of those dreams, like, right here?
 That's weird.
 It's psych 101. Actually, it's whatever comes before 101. You told Damon that you couldn't see him anymore, and now you're having dreams about Stefan?
 Stefan, hey.
 Is everything ok?
 Even though most of the time I am.
 Uh, no promises.
 I take that back. Actually, you're not crazy at all. Something's going on.
 Hey. Have you heard from my mom?
 Well, she was supposed to meet me here, and now she's not texting me back. If you see her, will you just let her know that something came up?
 Ok. Thanks.
 Can you tell Damon that there's something going on with Elena and Stefan?
 Well, you know how we all laughed off the notion that the universe is drawing Stefan and Elena together?
 Well, that's happening.
 Now that Stefan's doppel-him 
 Tom, yes. Now that Tom is dead, Stefan and Elena are the last pair of doppelgängers, which might explain why Stefan and Elena are suddenly having vision-type situations of each other.
 Yeah. They're more like romance dreams.
 He went to the Traveler camp to see if anyone's still there that can tell him what's going on.
 Well, it's our only lead. Look. All we know is that Tom is dead, the Travelers just committed a mass suicide, and now Stefan and Elena, who are clearly not together anymore, are having intense visions of each other.
 We said we'd call her. We didn't say we'd pick her up.
 Yes, please.
 Oh. This is so bad. They're fishing for small talk. We should do something.
 But I thought that's what this was.
 And that matters because?
 You mean Maggie? So what happened?
 Yeah, but  and no offense  But even if she still was alive, wouldn't she be, like, really old?
 Stefan just called. He said the scrap yard's been completely cleared out.
 Wait. I don't get it.
 I gave her my blood, but what do I do? She's still unconscious.
 What are they doing here? This is our home. We can't let them take over.
 Thanks, Tyler.
 I got to go. She's waking up. Hey.
 You missed lunch.
 Good news! So we don't have to be invited in, which is actually super sad if you think about it.
 Am I interrupting something?
 Ok. Heh.
 For a couple of doppel-targets, you two seem to be taking this all in stride.
 Shhh, I'm thinking.
 Hey!
 Stop!
 You're ruining the game.
 Charades. Our theme is secrets that people think they're getting away with.
 Well, I'm sure team "Stelena" will figure it out.
 It's probably nothing.
 Well, don't you think that Stefan and Elena have been a little... You know?
 Secretive? I caught them being all hushed and whispery at the car this morning, and now they're getting firewood out of the shed together, which apparently takes 20 minutes.
 No, no. I'm not talking about Enzo. I'm talking about Stefan and Elena.
 Come on! She's single now, you two are on the outs.
 Oh, come on! It'll be fun!
 I'll go first. Never have I ever died.
 Low blow.
 Never have I ever kissed a Salvatore brother.
 Today.
 So are you gonna drink or 
 Ok. What is going on?
 Enzo's dead?
 So my powers of deduction really suck. Why didn't you say anything?
 So you didn't know either?
 And their secret really was about Enzo.
 It doesn't make any sense. If Enzo wanted to kill Elena, drowning her wouldn't have worked.
 Maybe he's just trying to scare us.
 Luke? Luke? Where are you?
 I'm not upset. Just looking for Luke, you know, Luke, who was here to protect you and Stefan, Luke, who's now missing because you and Stefan lied about where Enzo was, and now the Travelers can find you, do their spell, and wipe us all off the face of the earth!
 What, he'd flip out and spiral and kill a bunch of innocent people? Yeah, I get that. I, however, am not Damon, so the fact that you lied to me about it makes less sense.
 Because it wasn't awkward when I accused you and Stefan of being makeout buddies again?
 I have no idea.
 Yes.
 What are they doing here? This is our home. We can't let them take over.
 Drink.
 We're friends, right? We tell each other things, we trust each other.
 No. It's just that you trust Elena more, and I get it. Of course you would. Still sucks to be left out of the loop, you know?
 Like what?
 Why?
 Oh, please! You're delusional.
 Liv and Luke aren't answering any of my....
 Oh my god! Mr. Sikes?
 Yeah! He helped me open my first savings account! He gave me a lollipop.
 If you know where Markos took Stefan and Elena, you need to tell us.
 What the hell is going on? Who are all these people?
 and what are you planning on doing with all of them?
 So you think drawing Markos to your house is the best idea?
 Julian is not Tyler. Therefore, he has no reason to help us. So until I figure out a way to get Tyler back, he's just extra baggage
 You know what? Your whole "too cool to care" thing is really starting to get old. Don't think for one second that I believe your mood has nothing to do with Elena.
 Fine! Just keep your torture happy hands away from Tyler until I figure something out. I don't abandon the people I care about.
 You're like.. permanently inhabiting the former love of my life. Let's debate the level of weird.
 Because he's a person... whose life you stole without asking. He deserves to be fought for.
 So. Why can't Markos and the other travelers find some other place to live?
 but that's just.. wrong.
 Well, why does he have to be so violent about it?
 So Julian is trapped inside Tyler forever, or until he dies. So, I was thinking.. what if he does die? You, know, maybe that's how we do it! That's how we get him out!
 He'll go to the other side and then, when Liv does the spell to help you and Enzo, Tyler can come back.
 And speaking of, shouldn't you be, like, preparing, or talking to Liv? Or doing anything other than packing up our dorm room?
 Right, but I think the other side falling apart is slightly more pressing than late housing fees.
 What are we even suppose to take? Photos, clothes, hair products? No that any of that matters when we're all dead.
 Why are you just sitting there?
 Well, think while you pack. Death is literally on its way. You said a vampire appeared to you, who died on old Miller road, which means the spell is moving past Mystic Falls. So, whatever will fit. The rest, we'll never see again.
 Hello! Bonnie! Which part of "we're about to die" isn't registering?
 Where's Bonnie? She was right behind me!
 It wasn't Stefan's fault.
 No! No! No!
 I didn't know where to bring him, and I just couldn't leave him outside.
 Bonnie has a plan, right? She—she said that she could bring people back. Tell me that she can bring him back!
 Stefan saved your life.
 Your brother's officially on the Other Side. Think you can risk it now?
 Hey, Professor Salvatore, not everyone can see the map.
 How? We can't lure anyone anywhere stuck out here.
 Tyler?
 What's wrong?
 What do you mean?
 You're not healing...
 Elena! Thank God!
 Wait? What's going on? Who are we missing? Where's Stefan?!
 Oh my god! Bonnie?
 Stefan!
 What's wrong?
 What?
 Lexy?
 I am home! I just signed the lease to my new apartment.
 You don't even like football.
 Yeah?
 No, we're going to go see a movie!
 Ahhh. You're sick of me..
 What? Did someone trample over Ms. Davis' flowerbed again?
 Vampire attacks? How? Vampires can't get into Mystic Falls.
 Hey. Don't forget your basket.
 Cover to cover, with no mention on how to undo an anti-magic force-field. And if I'm going to single-handedly take back our town, I'm gonna need a little bit more to go on.
 I read it.
 Fine. Thank you. So... how's Stefan?
 How often do you talk to him?
 Oh, huh.
 He didn't say goodbye. Damon and Bonnie died and he just left. No phone calls, no e-mails. Just disappeared into thin air. And I haven't heard from him in months. I actually convinced myself he was in some remote mountain region and couldn't accept my calls.
 Or maybe I just need to get over it. Thanks for the books.
 Oh, my god! What are you 
 What did you do? Why the hell are you feeding on people?
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. So you're the border-lurker?
 Yeah, did you know my mom's been out looking for a vampire prowler?
 Whoa, what herbs?
 God, is this what you've been doing this whole time? Hallucinating your dead boyfriend?
 Oh God, I get it okay? I do. But, there are better ways to get through this.
 Yeah but you're not getting through it, Elena. You're just pressing pause. Look, I'll call my mom and she can fix all this. But you need to get out of here, go hide, okay? So just... go.
 Do you know Elena has some witchy drug problem? Yeah, Luke Parker has been feeding her some concoction that allows her to hallucinate Damon.
 It gets her all bloodlusty and confused. She nearly killed a girl today.
 Yeah, well, neither did the fact that she got over Damon so quickly when he died. Now it's crystal clear. She hasn't. She's living in a fantasy land.
 She's a mess. And as long as Luke keeps playing witch doctor, she's not going to get any better.
 That's probably wise.
 Hey. It's me. Just leaving another message about how today was not a good day. Everyone drifted apart.
 It's like everyone's pretending they can get through this alone.
 Elena's gone and I think she's so scared to accept what happened that she's become a completely different person.
 And if you ask me, Tyler's just hiding at Whitmore, pretending everything's fine as if he can outrun his werewolf gene or something.
 And Matt and Jeremy never leave Mystic Falls anymore. There's an invisible wall standing between us and them and nobody's doing anything about it. Part of me wonders if they hope we never find a way back in.
 And then there's me, just sitting in a diner on the border of town looking for a way to get our home back. We just lost two of our closest friends. We need each other. We need to be together, Stefan, or pretty soon we're just gonna end up pictures in a yearbook in a drawer somewhere, and so, that is why I am not going to stop calling you until you pick up the phone and I hear your voice and you tell me that you are going to help me fix it. Because I am not going to give up on us.
 You said that Stefan was looking for a way to bring Damon and Bonnie back.
 Well, I've been a little focused on magic bubble duty. And as you can see by the lack of magic in Mystic Falls, it's a spectacular fail of a mission. And now you're telling me that this whole time no one has been doing anything to help Bonnie and Damon?
 Ahem.
 Yeah, but we are literally chasing a lead. W-what if we find something out? Yeah, you know what if Damon returns home and everything returns back to normal? And you're just sitting there all confused and weird?
 But 
 I don't know what to say, I was actually trying to think of what Bonnie would say.
 And...she'd say that you should do what's best for you.
 Well, then go on with your what-would-bonnie-bennett-do plan.
 I'll make bumper stickers.
 I love you too.
 And I heard you were a lurker who was spying on my life. When do we exit?
 Yeah, well I'm not taking feminist tips from a guy who just used his tongue to get secrets out of a coat check girl.
 You just made that up. So, did you also make up the 'Gemini Coven' lead too? Because I've never heard of them. Who are they?
 What?! Wu-Wait, where are we going?
 He and I went to high school together. He used to date my best friend. (She cuts a glance at Stefan.)
 Not that he's not allowed to date, I mean they broke up. I just didn't realize that he had met someone. So how did you meet exactly?
 You work at an Auto-Repair shop?
 Is Enzo your boyfriend?
 Ugh, oh god no. Would you date that?
 You've lived here for more than TWO months?
 Well, I guess that's just weird because, you know; everyone thought you were living somewhere else.
 And you're job was supposed to be investigative work not Auto-Repair.
 Well, you can't move on from investigative work until you've solved the investigation, Stefan.
 ENZO!
 Calm down, come with me. Let's go upstairs. No need to make a scene?!
 Hey, this is really not a good time.
 Okay, what's the wall?
)
 That she fell in love with Damon while she was still with Stefan. (The stairs creak behind her and she turns, it's Stefan. He looks at his feet.)
 Why? Why don't you care? You're the one who always cared, it's what I liked about you. You know amidst all the crazy in our perfectly-messed-up lives, you cared more than anyone. So how could you just stop?
 But Enzo has another lead, there's this coven in Oregon 
 Or me? Cause you never listened to them.
 Hey.
 Well, how about I come in, sneak in the dorms and spend the night later, for old times' sake.
 Love you too.
 I'm not staying. Last night was just a momentary moment of weakness.
 But I'm not moving back in. (She heads to the door.)
 Yeah, I guess.
 Do you understand the rules?
Mmhmm.
 Yup.
 Don't make fun of me. It's important that we let Elena live her new, happy, problem ignoring, zombie life the way she wants.
 I support her. She did what she needed to do to stop chomping on innocent people on the road. It doesn't mean that i'm enjoying marinating all alone in my misery.
 I appreciate it. Really i do.
 Rule no.4, Don't ever mention that jerk's name again or ( Enzo cuts in)
 Whoa..is that blood or pie? Please say pie.
 Tell me that you snatched, ate , erased.
 You killed her?
 Well, I'm sorry, but death shocks me, and it also leads to a missing persons report, which leads to
 Yeah. Not answering is one of his new things.
 Lying. Also one of his new things. Stefan has a lot of new things.
 Mmm! Well... Here we are, having fun. I'm having fun. Aren't we having fun? This is really fun.
 Well, that's the problem, Elena. Not all of us are ok with pretending. Some of us prefer to face our problems head-on.
 I'm just lonely, ok? And Bonnie's gone, Stefan's gone. Enzo... shocker...Terrible, murderous friend.
 Yeah. You're still here. (She gets up to leave)
 I thought I told Enzo to go get more ice.
 Congratulations. Now it's your job. Go get ice.
 Is that why you brought your latest fling in a series of sad attempts to pretend like you don't care about Bonnie...To have fun?
 Stefan.
 What are you doing?
 What did you do?
 Stop, ok? I am sorry. I did not know about Ivy, but...
 Well, actually, I was gonna say, "but killing Enzo won't bring her back."
 So that's why you left all those messages on my phone, promising apologies. That's why you visited Elena, that's why you came to this party, just to kill Enzo and start over?
 I don't believe you. I know that a part of you misses this place and these people, your friends. I know that being back here reminds you how much we need you, how much... I need you, but if I'm wrong, then go ahead. Just go. Start over, but, God, if I'm right, if just a little part of you came back to check on Elena, who's had an unbearable 4 months, or Alaric, who just came back from the dead, or me... If even just a small, little part of you came back to check on me... Then stay.
 Well, why not? Is she on vervain?
 Compulsion is magic.
 So, I was just gonna leave my clothes here while we look, if that's okay.
 I also was thinking that - you know - if there are vampire hunters on the loose then living alone right by there home base is probably not a good idea.
 Yes, this is an official unpack. I'm sorry I got mad at you earlier. Sometimes it just seems like you have your secret way to move on. Is this ... ?
 I miss Bonnie, I miss Mystic Falls, I miss my old life. And I miss ...
 Yeah, I miss Stefan.
 Yeah, I think maybe I did. Well, we should go ahead and find that girl before she outs us.
 Stefan? Where have you ?
 What are you doing? And what is with this trunk?
 Ivy, how did this happen?
 No, No, no, no.
 No, no. This is not my mess. This is your mess.
 Do I need to remind you that there is a vampire hunter lurking around?
 Shut up!
 Yeah? Well, you don't have to flatter me because I already know that. Stefan  All right? So just a couple of hours, and then you'll never have to deal with me again.
 Is that what you think I want?
 Okay.
 I think you're wearing my dress. And you must be deaf because I already said. The. Party's. Not. Happening.
 No. I would rather be at the party she swings her head just like I'd rather have friends who didn't ignore me for months and then use me when they need help.
 Excuse me?
 Oh, you kn  My relationship with Stefan is strictly... c-complicated. Okay, aren't you supposed to be practicing your vamping or something?
 Stefan will be here very soon, and then you can do whatever you want... WITH HIM.
 Finally, a good idea. What kind of game do you want to play?
 I have tournament, classic, and travel-sized.
 Stefan, hey. This is the third message alerting you that your psychotic little she-vamp has gone AWOL, and if you hadn't noticed, it's dark outside, so every dead sorority girl tonight is officially on you.
 THANK GOD!
 Oh, so you decide to listen to your messages a million hours later? No, I didn't lose her, she snapped my neck. What the hell took you so long?
 You got caught up doing what?
 You were leaving?
 No.
 No, I don't care about some stupid ring, Stefan! Were you seriously about to dump your vampire ex-girlfriend onto my lap, and then just skip town?
 God, who are you right now?!
 You know what the worst part about all of this is? Is about a month ago, I wished that Damon would come back. Because I knew if that happened, that I'd get you back too. But right now, all I want is for you to just get back in your car, and go.
 Where are you?
 Oh, you mean, break my neck? Yeah, I noticed.
 Tell me exactly where you are and stay put, I'll come get you.
 Don't exaggerate, I'm almost there.
 I don't know. Honestly everything Stefan said after "Damon's back" is kind of a blur.
 He said she wasn't over there.
 Why didn't you tell us Enzo has been locked up this whole time?
 Matt!
 Okay. Well, what about Ivy? Is she there, too?
 Oh, God.
 Well, that's not going to happen, because we're busting him out, right? And if for no other reason than so I can kick his ass for getting caught in the first place.
 Right. So, you handed Enzo over so we wouldn't be targeted, and now you're rescuing him so we won't be targeted. Way to go.
 Oh. Well, in that case, sounds like you were just being practical. So, did you rat out Ivy, too?
 Well, you didn't want to deal with her anymore. You wanted her gone, and now she is. You know what, you really should write Tripp a thank-you note.
 The only one who turned in other vampires is you, Stefan. That's why you're helping  guilt for getting Damon's friend captured.
 Great. Good for you. Let me know when you figure out how you're gonna make everything up to me.
 Let's get in there Well, where the hell is he?
 No. Enzo is not here. Any idea where Tripp might have taken him, besides the very obvious one?
 And? I mean the guy is a murderer, petty theft isn't much of a stretch.
 Oh, my God. He knows what I am.
 Sorry, Mom, Elena is auditioning for "Top Gear" So, my mom is shutting down Route 13. Tripp will have to double back, and there's only two other ways across the border.
 Do you have a preference? Front? Back? What do you think? Elena?
 Wait. What? (Elena turns to face her)
 Yeah, I'll tell her. Thanks (She hangs up as Elena vamp-speeds up to her, coming from the opposite direction)
 Yeah, I know. They had to get out of there.
 Uh, Stefan said that, um...
 Alaric crossed the border... but Jo was there, and she saved him.
 Yeah, Elena, he's okay.
 All the magic stripped away, but Jo saved him just before he died.
 Alaric is not a vampire anymore, Elena. He's human.
 Hey. So, am I your last stop on the Stefan Salvatore Apology Tour?
 I'm trying to.
 Yeah, well... you know, that's the thing, Stefan  after all of this, I... I don't want to be friends anymore.
 You didn't feel anything?
 So you don't remember. So be it.
 Well, Elena, look at your life right now. You're doing well in school, you're following your dreams, you met Liam, who also has very pretty eyes, not mention he's never killed your brother.
 I mean, I just gave Stefan the friend boot. Maybe a little break from the Salvatore brothers is in the cards for the both of us. Look. McDreamy's coming. I got to go. I'll see you later.
 That's weird.
 None of your business. We're not friends anymore, which means you can't just show up unannounced at my door. Good-bye.
 So, what? You here to protect me? News flash! I don't need your protection, and more importantly, I don't want it.
 Hey, mom. Can I call you back? I'm trying to get a piece of gum off of my shoe.
 Tripp? No. I have no idea. Why?
 Answer your phone, Enzo! I just... I didn't call her today, you know? I always call my mom every Saturday morning, but, no, today, I said, "screw it. I want to sleep in. I'll do it tomorrow."
 We're almost there? You said, two hours and then kill him." Do you even remember how long ago you said that? I mean, what kind of person sets a ticking clock without setting his watch?
 Tell me that Tripp is still alive.
 What took you so long to answer your phone?
 Just don't kill him, ok? One of his guys took my mom, so just keep your hands off of him so I can get her back, ok? Enzo, please.
 What did you do to him?
 Shut up, Enzo. And did he really need 3 chains? I mean, who is this guy, the Hulk?
 No, but you let your sidekick Enzo do it because what could go wrong when you team up with your sworn enemy?
 Whatever he just said, it will never be discussed again, ok?
 Mom?
 You're bleeding? What'd you do to her?
 Let her go, or I'll kill you.
 He's across. Now let her go.
 Oh, my God.
 You hit your head. You could have a concussion, and I know better than to trust that you're going to take yourself for a checkup back home.
 You can go now. We're fine.
 Gladly.
 I'll be right outside, ok?
 Please don't ask my mother for her opinions.
 Yeah. I've got superhearing. I hear everything.
 Why was I listening?
 I don't.
 We said that we would never talk about this again, so just...
 What kind of a stupid question is that? Why did I have a thing for you? I don't know, Stefan. Maybe it's because I thought you worth having a thing for, because when I woke up as a vampire you told me that I would get through it and I did, because when I watched Elena move on with your brother I couldn't imagine why she would let anyone like you go, because you were practically my best friend, because I trusted you.
 Feeling it back?
 Yeah. Well... I know what you felt, Stefan, because even if just a little tiny piece of you felt for me what I was starting to feel for you, you wouldn't have walked away, and I don't hate you for that. I don't hate you for mourning your brother, I don't hate you for being the biggest jerk on the planet while doing so, and I accept your apology.
 Yes. Yeah, I hate you because if I don't hate you for ruining our friendship, then I have to hate myself for ruining it, and I think that I deserve better than that.
 I don't know. Maybe a little less emphasis on vampire.
 Well, maybe Liam will stop digging into Lady Whitmore's miraculous recovery, and you won't have to come clean.
 OK. You know all of this can go away with one fell mind wipe.
 OK. If you want to tell him the truth, I support you 100%, but if you're rushing into this to escape some conflicted feelings over a certain ex who just came back into your life, then I suggest you keep your fangs to yourself.
 Bonnie's alive?
 All right! If everyone could gather around the table at their assigned seats, then, um...
 We will each share something that we are thankful for in 100 words or less, so...
 Oh. You know what? Now would actually be an excellent time just to shut down anything with an on-off button.
 No. Please let the food get cold. Whatever that is is far more important.
 So if you don't know each other, then how did you all just happen to end up at the same tiny liberal arts school?
 There are two sets of twins in your family?
 Oh, look! We don't have a wine opener on the table. Liam, you have a wine opener in your room. Why don't you get it? Take your time.
 As you were saying, you put Kai away?
 OK. Well, now that we've all gotten to know each other a little bit better, could someone please pass the dinner rolls?
 That's not what I meant. It's—
 Hey. You're here. That's good. That actually saves me a trip. Needless to say, there were leftovers.
 Just because I hate you doesn't mean I want you to starve to death. Besides, Bonnie's alive. You know, this is, like, the first Thanksgiving in forever where there's something to actually be thankful for, so...
 Yeah, I know, Stefan. You pushed everyone away. It's kind of what you do.
 Thank you for saying that.
 Enjoy the leftovers.
 I just figured that we were skipping Christmas this year, you know, considering the part where I die if I cross the border into my hometown.
 Was my favorite time of year when I could actually live in my own house and help decorate the town tree and drink hot cocoa with my friends.
 What are you doing? You're supposed to be at the Mystic Falls tree decorating ceremony.
 You even brought our favorite ornaments. Mom!
 What are you doing here?
 The little ones, obviously.
 Dad's not here yet.
 But it's an undeclared law that the sheriff and her husband put the star on the tree!
 Is something going on between you two?
 Mom, I'm a freshman in High School, ok? I can handle adult conversations.
 Ahh! Cute surfer? Where?
 Ok, great! Now that Christmas is saved, let's get these garlands on the tree before they end up on your hips.
 What are you doing here?
 No, Stefan. What are you doing here? Because if you think hanging a few stands of light is gonna make me forget what a crappy friend you've been, then you thought wrong.
 You're trying? No. This is the easy part, ok? We're hanging Christmas lights. Anyone can be friends when you're hanging Christmas lights.
 Mom?!
 Mom! You ok?
 Hey.
 I don't know. She just collapsed. One second, we're decorating, and then the next, she's just on the ground. Maybe she forgot to eat. You know, sometimes, she skips breakfast.
 Oh, God. Now you sound like Stefan. He just went to go find something to take the edge off.
 They have her sedated. She's going to be asleep for a while. Can you just come and distract me?
 How's the search for the new Ascendant thingy?
 God. Poor Bonnie. Do you think she knows it's Christmas? You know she never liked being away from us at Christmas.
 So are you and Damon...
 Actually, I was going to say that I think it's great how he's always been there for you when it mattered, you know, through thick and thin, good times and bad times. Maybe I haven't given him enough credit.
 Biggest mistake of junior year... Including the boys in secret santa. Stefan is officially the worst gift giver.
 Yeah, of Mystic Falls, as if I don't see enough of this town every day as it is.
 Of course you do because I am good at secret santa, and I didn't purchase it from a quick stop.
 Hey. Uh, there's no news. Apparently, they're still running tests.
 That just doesn't make sense. My mom would have said something to me.
 Ok. So my mom has a brain tumor. Then we'll just give her vampire blood.
 Fine. Then when are they gonna operate?
 Ok. Well, if they can't operate, then they'll give her chemo, right?
 Well, then they're wrong because they don't know her. They don't know how strong she is. I mean, she's gonna get through this, Stefan. Right?
 Bad news is  the employee kitchen didn't have a juicer. Good news is  they do now.
 It's a kale smoothie. It's good for DNA cell repair and for slowing cancer. Oh, are you warm enough?
 Let me just get you another blanket. (gets blanket out of drawer)
 I'm just trying to help here, since apparently, modern medicine takes forever. I don't understand why we can't skip all the guess-work and go straight to something that works. Like vampire blood.
 Okay, then what do you want to talk about? How the doctors can't operate, how chemo won't work, how radiation won't shrink the tumor? Damon, feel free to jump in with your support here at any time.
 You don't think that our blood will work?
 You kept my orchid alive. That's amazing.
 Uhm, Stefan volunteered to move your entertainment center in here, so now you can watch TV from your favorite chair.
 So if you start the Friends boxset now, I'll be back in time for Monica and Chandler's wedding. Stefan, you know how to laugh, right?
 Every minute counts, so I'm going to go get a second opinion from one of the world's leading experts in Grade 4 Glioblastoma. I couldn't sleep; I Googled.
 Duke.
 A friend?
 Stefan, I know all of your friends. Elena. Me. And then that's it.
 I will call you every hour on the hour.
 I love you.
 So your friend I've never heard of is a world-famous photographer?
 Oh, goody. Freshman art. Since you're so good at noticing untapped potential. How do you know this person again? Okay, they can see us right now.
 Okay. Uh, Oncology Center, D4. Come find me.
 And that's when I read your article in the "New England Journal of Medicine." You know, the one about tumor reduction using hypothermia treatments?
 Well, I didn't say I understood it. And you're not gonna give me any grief on insurance or confidentiality or anything except your honest opinion.
 So, you're saying that there's no feasible medical solution?
 I want to see him.
 Collin Phelps. Inoperable tumor. They zapped your brain with radiation for months. They still couldn't save you. Yeah, I'd be groggy too, if I were on this many painkillers. And the doctor said all they can do is make you comfortable while you wait for the end. I'm really sorry to hear that.
 Next of kin, none. I'm really sorry to hear that, too. But you see, on my mom's chart, this spot, next of kin, that's where my name goes. Caroline Forbes. I'm all she's got.
 Hey, I know we just met, but you're not going to remember any of this.
 I thought you were meeting me here.
 Okay, that's fascinating. Can you just get here? I'm I'm conducting an experiment.
 I'll show you when you get here. Just hurry. (she hangs up)
 An hour ago, he was dying of brain cancer. Now, look at him. Smile, Stefan! This is good news! My blood worked, he's totally fine.
 As opposed to what? Vampire blood heals a stab wound like it was never there? It's always easy, Stefan. It is literally magic.
 Because vampires don't spend their lives pulling charity work at the sick ward.
 Stefan, I just...I need you to believe it will work. Or at the very least, just believe that I believe it will work.
 Then take me home to my mom.
 Okay.
 So, if Sarah is Zach's daughter, then does that make you Uncle Stefan?
 No, I think it's incredibly noble that you've been keeping an eye on her all these years. And she's lucky to have you in her life, even if she has no idea.
 Your secret's safe with me, Stefan.
 No, thank you. Thank you for coming with me today and for rewiring my mom's speaker system and for just not treating me like a crazy person, because that's how I've felt these past few days. So, thank you. Wish me luck.
 It was good. It was really good. Thanks for staying with her, Matt.
 And she said that your doctors are doing everything right. And she also said that there is nothing that they can do to cure you.
 Waiting for more medical opinions isn't going to change this. You're dying, mom. And we're out of options. Which is why I gave my blood to a cancer patient today. And I healed him.
 He was dying and my blood healed him. I want all of that. I want you to live for me. And I know that that's selfish, but that's the truth.
 Okay.
 Everything's gonna be okay.
 Colin.
 Hey.
 Mom's still sleeping. Don't wake her up.
 I don't know. H-he was fine when we left him at Duke, remember? He was running around and pain-free and scarfing down all that disgusting vending machine food.
 I don't know.
 I don't know. Maybe. She's been running around like crazy, saying she need to get her ducks in a row or...
 He died.
 Uhm, Jo has an idea.
 Hey. The coffee machine's broken. Seriously, what kind of hospital is this? If you can't fix a coffee machine, then how are you supposed to be able to fix people?
 I screwed up. Big time. Why did I feed her that blood?
 No, I was trying to fix something that I had no business trying to fix. It's like textbook definition of control freak from Hell.
 That's Colin's room.
 Okay, we'll try to help, but just please stop hurting yourself.
 Why the hell did you do that?
 God.
 No, it's fine. You know, he's just saying what everyone else is thinking. I killed my mom.
 Good, you're here. I actually need a second opinion. I kind of like this because sunflowers are her favorite flower, but at the same time, I was also thinking maybe they're a little too over-the-top cheerful for a memorial service. So this was the second option, um, because roses are classic, right? I mean, especially in this shade of pink. Obviously, I would change out the vase, but 
 If you're thinking of saying something to make me feel better, don't. I don't deserve to feel better.
 Good.
 Yeah, but all of this still needs to be done, right? She's not gonna want to live out the rest of her life as a vampire in excruciating pain. So I should do something that I'm good at, instead of making everything worse. Which arrangement?
 I don't I don't know what to say to her.
 I can't. I can't even face her.
 What if she can't forgive me?
 No, no! Mom, mom! Don't leave me, please. Please, no. Please don't leave me, mom.
 Mom?
 Mom.
 Hi.
 I've just been sitting here, trying to figure out what to say. I guess I should lead with  I'm sorry for almost killing you.
 I'm just sorry that I wasn't here. I couldn't 
 Okay.
 I will. Mom, you put the house in my name.
 Yeah. Well, I don't I'm not ready for that yet.
 Okay.
 Hey.
 Where'd you get that?
 I can do that. I'll be right back. (gets up and leaves the room)
 (on the phone with her
 Is it just me, or do her

 No. She didn't lose her. I
 Miss Cuddles isn't. She's
 Yeah. It's Bonnie's

 No.

 Shut up.
 Yeah. Oh, wait. (The bears
 I'm sorry. (She hugs him
 If you really think about it, Jeremy leaving is for the best. I'm sure everything around him reminds him of Bonnie, and Elena's always wanted to protect him from vampire drama. Granted, he is going to art school, where the percentage rate for a well-paying job is one of the lowest in the country, but I really am happy for him.
 The whole point of this is for my mom to live out the rest of her time here in a relaxed and peaceful environment surrounded by the things that she loves, like photo albums and board games.
 All the books that she's never gotten around to reading.
 Oh. Yeah. Sorry. Um, ok. Um... Just... Sorry.
 Got it. Um... Hmm. Why is my mom calling you? Are you going behind my back for information?
 Why are you calling him?
 If I told you, it would ruin the surprise. Master bedroom.
 Neither. He's here because you asked him to look after me.
 Mom, I heard you talking to him in hospital. You asked him to look after me and make me smile and help me move on with my life after you're gone.
 Mom, look. It's ok. Needed an extra set of hands, anyway. I will call you in 3 hours with all the details. Until then, no cheating. I love you. (Beep)
 Look what I found in the...
 Ha ha! This is the bike that I learned to ride on. I just didn't know my mom kept it. It used to have these training wheels on the back with lights that would flash every time you pedaled. Then one day, my mom took them off and said it was time to be a big girl. You can imagine the princess-sized tantrum that followed.
 Yeah. So what's with all... this.
 You know that you don't have to do all this, right?
 No. I mean being here with me. You know, if you have someplace else you'd rather be...
There's a cellar under the stairs.
 Do you realize that whichever book my mom reaches for could be the last thing that she ever reads? "Jane Eyre" is 600 pages. What if she doesn't finish, or, worse, what if she gets halfway through and then realizes that she hates it? What if she wastes her final precious moments on a terrible book? I just don't want to be held responsible for ruining her last literary experience.
 No. No. I should do it.
Heh. I'm opening this.
 Oh, it was.
 
 What doesn't matter?
 I know. I just wanted it to be perfect, you know? I just wanted...
 I know that she asked you to look after me.
 I'm ok with it, really. I'm glad, actually, because I don't know if I would be able to get through this on my own.
 Then why are you here?
 I think we both know I never really hated you. (They kiss)
 One of us should probably say something.
 Not that.
 Where is she? Elizabeth Forbes, what room's she in?
 Damon.
 She's not comfortable. She's dying! I didn't get to say good-bye. I didn't get to say good-bye to my mom.
 I should have been with her.
 But I knew she was sick, and I knew it was bad.
 I'm her daughter, Stefan, OK? I was supposed to give her peace and convince her that I would be OK and thank her for being an amazing mom. God, I don't ever remember the last thing that I said to her. I was supposed to be with her in her final moment.
 Ok.
 I don't know. There's too many.
 We can do that? (Stefan nods)
 I want to stop.
I don't want to learn.
 I can't do it.
 I'm gonna fall off.
 I'm scared. I want my other wheels back on.
 Don't let go, mommy.
 Don't let go. I'm not ready.
 Mom... 
 You're making fun of me.
 Mommy?
 Am I gonna die?
 Are you gonna die?
 But what if you die and I'm still here?
 I think I'll always need you.
 Sorry. Just, um, water.
 So what are you not writing?
 That's... nice, I guess. (she fills a glass with tap water)
 We don't have to share.
 I just mean today is pretty much gonna be the worst day of my life. I'm not sure that I need to start it off by bonding with you. No offense.
 Great. Thanks for the water. (Starts to walk out of the kitchen)
 Appreciate the tip. (Walk out)
 You've all asked what you can do to help.
 There are five day's worth of projects on here. We are going to do them in one. We can break the rules and cut through the red tape. I expect my mom to be properly celebrated and buried by the end of the day.
 Elena, you're coming with me.
 Casket shopping. Let's move!
 Jeremy! I forgot to put him on my list of people to call.
 I don't know how you survived this.
 I kissed Stefan. I want to talk to him about it, but if it's bad, I feel like he won't be honest, you know, not today.
 I think I need to know today. We're behind schedule. Let's go.
 Yeah. Fine. All things... considered.
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. No. I don't know. Just now, I was supposed to put you into a category so I would know what to say to you, but then I realized I didn't know what category you would want to be put in. So, uh, I was thinking, "I guess there's no time like the horribly inappropriate present to get to the bottom of that." I could list the categories if you like.
 Yeah. God, of course. Um, this is not the time. I'm so sorry.
 No, I'm okay. I'm ready.
 Thank you all for coming. This is for my mom. ♪Go in peace. Go in kindness. Go in love. Go in faith. Leave the day. The day behind us. The day is done. Go in grace. Let us go into the dark. Not afraid. Not alone. Let us hope by some good pleasure. Safely to. Arrive at home.♪
 Yeah. I think I've done the whole funeral thing enough for one day.
 No, it's two blocks. I'll be fine, Elena.
 I think that's exactly what I need actually. Thank you for everything you did today, Elena. I'll never forget it.
 I'll be fine, Elena. Okay? I just had to get through today.
 I said I was fine, Elena.
 I thought I could get through the rough patch and just pick myself up after like I usually do, but then Damon made me realize it's just going to get worse.
 I can't do worse, Elena, okay? I didn't even think there was a worse. It's better this way.
 That is your experience, okay? I have more control over my vampire side than you ever did. My experience will be different.
 Yeah, that's my point, Elena. You did it. You couldn't handle the pain when your brother died, so you turned it off. Damon died, and you erased all your memories. Stefan moved to Savannah and became an auto mechanic. What, do you think that you guys are the only ones who get to escape grief?
 Were they mistakes? Because when you came out the other end, the worst part of the pain was gone, and that's what I need. I just need the pain to be gone.
 Well, he didn't, so it really doesn't matter. My mom is dead, Elena. I-It hurts so bad, I can't breathe. I can't-I can't do worse. I can't, okay? I shouldn't have to.
 That's not your choice to make.
 Hello, I'm empty. More, please!
 Okay, look at my face. This is me straining to care less about what you think.
 Nope. I can't.
 Okay, here's the thing  my mum just died, as in I just put her dead, cancer-riddled body into the ground... 
 Oh, no, no, no, I don't care about that. I'm just saying that my feet have been cramped in the world's most uncomfortable heels for an entire day, and your tequila is the only thing that seems to be helping.
 Thank you.
 
 You are drunk.
 Oh, lucky you! I stood all day at my mum's funeral. 
 Do you wanna get out of here?
 What, girlfriend? We all know you're not dating Elena Gilbert.
 
 And you’re perceptive. 
 Starting over. New everything! 
 
 You mean, you were worried about those around me, like if I killed them? Okay. Funny story. You remember Liam? 
 I ate him! 
 
 Fine. So I was feeding 
 
 
 Well, I was going to drain you of your blood, but now I’m not really in the mood to drag your corpse through the woods. Definitely not in these heels. I could throw you in a dumpster, but then everyone’s always being found in dumpsters, and since I was the last person to be seen with you, I’ll be questioned by the police, and what if one of them reminds me of my dead mother?
 
 Elena, I shut off my humanity. I didn’t turn into an idiot. The last thing I want to do is give you a reason to ruin my life.
 
 That’s all I want. Now granted, if anyone tries anything to flip my switch back on—- and I mean anything— 
 It's okay. The whole vampire thing is over anyway.
 Who is this nice girl we're divulging all of our deepest, darkest secrets to?
 Sarah. Photographer Sarah. Stefan's 
 It is so nice not to care what you're up to with that poor girl. 
 
 I'm actually a little bored, which is why I'm recruiting cute boys to come to Whitmore's Warehouse party tonight. You like to dance, right?
 See you there.
 
 Well, that's certainly a look.
 You know, you should smile more. You're hot!
 And obviously, you're here to babysit me, but I've had less attractive babysitters. Granted, they were old women, and I was eight...
 Yes, you are. You, Elena, Bonnie. You don't think that I can live a normal, humanity-less vampire existence without killing anyone, and you feel guilty for being such a royal ass at my mom's funeral.
 And now I don't care.
 I said, I don't care.
 
 
 No, Stefan. You know what? It just means that I'm pissed, so leave me alone.
 
 Hey, where have you been?
 
 Perfect! Come with me.
 There you are. Finally. 
 
 Stefan's been looking out for Sarah ever since she was a baby, which means he will protect her at any cost.
 So, what do you do when you want someone to have nothing to do with vampires?
 Thank you. 
 Aw, is someone having a bad night?
 I stole it, but that's not the question that you should be asking right now. You should be asking, "Why does Enzo have Sarah Salvatore's number in his phone?" Or maybe, "Where is Sarah Salvatore?" And ultimately, "What the hell are you going to do to her, Caroline?"
 Enzo, yeah I heard you. He's not here right now, but I am.
 
 Hey! I'm making margaritas. You want one?
 I see Stefan filled you in on his big secret.
 Not here. That would be stupid. 
 Sarah is helping Liam with his surgical skills.
 
 Obviously. I was pretty clear about that.
 I compelled a student to perform surgery on Stefan's niece, and you found a way to make this about you? God, you truly have a gift, Elena.
 That's the problem, Stefan. It doesn't really matter how far away you are. You're still you  kind, loyal, 
 I know, that's why I'd rather just change you. Let go of that part of you, Stefan.
 If Stefan wants to save Sarah's life  
 
 
 Cut out her spleen.
 Relax! She can live without a spleen, you know. It's really the infection you should be worried about.
 Don't answer him, Liam.
 Hey!
 
 How's it going, Liam?
 You know what? I changed my mind. Leave the spleen. 
 Take out her heart.
 Liam, you still with me?
 You don't realize this, but this really does hurt me to watch. 
 
 
 Hey. You're gonna be a doctor, right? How long can one live without their heart? Maybe, like, three seconds tops?
 
 Don't walk there. Ugh! I just washed that.
 Stefan and I had a moment. Things broke in the process, and now I'm returning the Scull Bar to the way we found it.
 I go to school here, Enzo. I want to keep going to school here, and the second that I draw any suspicions   break-ins, broken property, dead bodies   people will try to interrupt my routine. Then I will end up rotting in a cell somewhere instead of what I should be doing, which is preparing for my audition tomorrow.
 Musical. And obviously, duh. I'm a drama major. And what are you doing here?
 Because you're the only one with Sarah Salvatore's phone number.
 To use her life as leverage to convince Stefan to shut his humanity switch off too.
 She's alive, assuming she survived any infections resulting from Liam's amateur surgery.
 Like I said, I will stop at nothing to maintain my routine, so I suggest that you stay away. Now if you don't mind, I need to prepare for my audition.
 Hello? Pretty sure I crushed that.
 What the hell are you doing? That was the director!
 It's a performance, Stefan.
 Well, if your humanity's off, then you shouldn't really care how I deal.
 Well that's not my problem.
 This is seriously about revenge?
 Oh, shoot. Is your bike okay? Do you need money for the bus?
 I just had to stuff the director's body into a furnace. Do you know how hard it was to get an audition during spring break?
 This is your only warning. Go away.
 I dismantled your bike.
 Hello? Is anyone there?
 Damnit, Stefan! What do you want?
 Leave me alone!
 Stefan, stop!
 I am not going to let you ruin my life.
 What are you doing? It's called "spring break."
 He's fine.
 Nice going, you jackass!
 So, to summarize, "letting go" means being an idiot, increasing your chances of getting caught, and worst of all, actively making choices 
 At least they're still breathing.
 Back. Away.
 ...Hey!
 Where are you going?
 What are you doing?
 If you're trying to tempt me, it's not working.
 Ahhh. That wasn't terrible.
 I don't even remember how we got back to my room. Where's my shirt?
 You're right. Your way is much more fun.
 
 
 Oh! I'm Caroline  
 
 Well, then why aren't you freaking out? A panic attack? A heart attack? Come on, give me something.
 
 
 Oh, my God! Are those spiders all over your body?
 
 A win is a win. So, you know what we do now?
 Hahaha!
 Let's play "Caroline Trivia!"
 Oh, sure you do! You both dated me, which means you should know everything about me. So, I'm gonna ask you some questions about myself, and whoever answers them right lives.
 
 Very good! Alright, Matt. Your turn. What is my favorite color?
 
 Oh, I'm sure I mentioned it at some point.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nice going, Tyler!
 
 
 So... you have a mother?
 
 Sorry, Stefan. But thanks for the head start.
 Aw... An angel. How cute is this place?
 Okay, so I'll bite. So, you hunt me down in a bar  where I am perfectly content feeding on the wait staff  so you can whine to me about how your mom is a bitch 
 Ohhh... Duh.
 Who are you calling?
 Now what are you doing?
 Such a gentleman.
 Dinner...
 Stefan?
 What happened?
 Grr!! Ohh! They vampire-proofed a B & B. How did they even know we were here?
 Why are you so calm? Help me.
 Ugh! Every move I make feels like sandpaper rubbing against my veins.
 I know how desiccation works, Stefan!
 I can literally feel my cells shrinking.
 What's with the lecture? Just shut up and let me enjoy this.
 Elena. Let me guess  Humanity Police was your idea.
 Remember that time Jeremy died and you turned off your humanity and tried to kill the prom queen, AKA your best friend Bonnie? I forget. Stefan, was that before or after she killed some waitress for no reason?
 Heh. You see. Stefan and I are just finding it a little ironic that you think you're qualified to tell us how to deal with the death of a loved one.
 Her impeccably perfect handwriting? Yep. I remember when she taught me how to write my name in cursive.
 So, what, am I supposed to read this and snap back to sad, pathetic, motherless Caroline? Burn it!
 Did I say, "Stand there and look stupid?" No. I said, "Burn it!"
 Why do you care?
 Did those words seriously just come out of your mouth? God!
 Burn it! Now!
 Ugh! This is torture!
 Ugh. Like, actual torture. Elena and Damon talking about their future together. Ech! Just... I want to die.
 Oh, my God. What I would do for just a sip of human blood.
 You know when you're feeding on someone's neck  (She runs her hand up his leg and leans toward him)  and their artery's still pulsing? I really love that.
 They do. So take my mind off it.
 Go away, Damon.
 That would have been me.
 Why are you only picking on me? Stefan's in here, too. Annoy him.
 She got cancer, Damon. That is where she went wrong.
 You know what? You're right. I should really just be more like you and Elena, just play make-believe about the future that I can't have, because that's healthy.
 Maybe I'll pretend I can actually give birth to babies and have a normal family, and I can get a job without having to move and start over every five years. I can operate on my patients without wanting to feed on them.
 I'm curious, Damon. How does it feel to know that you can't give someone the life that she really wants?
 I'm just stating the facts, Elena. You didn't want this life. You can play fantasy-land all you want, but in this life, the one where you're a vampire, you'll always be settling, and it's just so sad.
 Ugh. It's like a million degrees in here.
 He speaks. You were so quiet earlier when I was tearing into Elena. I was scared you were feeling sad for her.
 Ohh. Much better. I highly recommend it.
 Are you sure? Because I can give you a hand if you want.
 I heard you. You know what else I hear?
 Your heart. And it's racing. Am I making you nervous?
 When did you flip it back?
 Your humanity's been back on this whole time, hasn't it? Damon and Elena knew where to find us because you told them, and that's why they were only picking on me.
 How dumb do you think I am, Stefan? A few days ago, you tore my clothes off. Now you don't even want to kiss me? What's wrong, hmm? What, you don't want to take advantage of me? You don't want to ruin our nonexistent relationship?
 Relax, Stefan. I don't really feel like kissing anymore.
 Oh, thank God. Snack time.
 Mom, what are you...
 Mom, it's me. It's Caroline.
 You're not real. You can't be real.
 Stop! I know what you're doing.
 Shut up! Stop! You can't be here.
 I know what you're doing to me, Stefan. My mom died. She's dead. This isn't real.
 That was your plan all along?
 Just get away from me.
 Ugh! I said get away from me.
 I don't want your help, Stefan. I just want you to die. Your heart's racing again, Stefan. Let me fix that.
 What the hell is this?
 I want to see the rest. Let me see her!
 Wait, wait. Mom! Mom! It's me! It's Caroline. Just come outside. I want to talk to you.
 Make her come back!
 No. Just show me the vision again, okay? I... I want to see my mom, Stefan. I... I need to know what she said in that letter.
 No. No. No! What do you think she wanted to tell me?
 No. I did this. This is all my fault. No. I tried to kill you, and then I made you turn it off, and then we... Oh, my God.
 I'm so sorry, Stefan. I ruined everything. I ruined everything.
 Hey.
 Don’t... Don’t.
 How can I be okay after everything that I ruined? Just don't worry about me. I'm not gonna turn it off again, but you... And... Us... This... I just really need to get out of here.
 
 To be honest, I think maybe this is a good thing! Because no matter how good Danielle was, I am pretty sure I'm better.
 I missed me, too.
 Thank you for getting me back.
 Hi!
 Okay, now, we've got a lot to do and not a lot time to do it. Elena, just have a drink, you're not going to pass out. Bonnie, the switch is on the left-hand side on the back.
 And Jo, I can see your shoes under the couch. Okay, now, who's dealing with the boys?
 Okay, the boys are officially taken care of, bride and maid of honor are in hair and make-up. I'm gonna head to the venue and fix... whatever they're screwing up.
 Elena, the curling iron!
 Okay!
 Uh, I do, actually. Because if you walked on them, they could cut you and you'd get infected and probably die.
 So, what's it like now in the world of the living?
  Be a monster like me, who turns off their humanity and commits murder instead of dealing with grief like a normal person?
 Look, I'm so sorry, Elena. I was trying to hurt you when I said that you would never truly be happy with Damon because you weren't human. And now you are, and I just hope that it's not because I made you think that you would be miserable for eternity.
 Thanks, I kind of wanted to start with an easy one.
 Mmm, if you see Stefan, by the way, I am avoiding. I just need to get my life in order first. Starting with my friends.
 Stefan's... complicated. I just figured I'd work my way up to that one.
 What's wrong with Damon?
 Damon Salvatore? Human? I... I can't even picture it.
 No, not there, there. Still a little bit higher. Well, that's not a little, but...
 I tried to kill you. My humanity was off, but I still tried to kill you, and you're my friend, and... I'm sorry.
 He's not my boyfriend.
 You have to know, I would never do anything like that if it weren't for...
 Hahaha! Nice try! But, if I were getting married in an altar that looked like that, I would be divorced in a week. So come on, Lockwood. Next row.
 Goody! More amends. Drinks will help  strong ones.
 I made you guys some amazing drinks, with a little bit of tequila. Okay, a lot of tequila. And there's only one of you. What did you do?
 He said angrily.
 No, you're supposed to talk to her like an adult and work out your problems.
 No, but I know about your problems... unless you're cool with only making it two weeks in the police academy and then having no purpose in life? At least when you had her, you were trying, Tyler.
 Oh, excuse me, they need some more drinks over there. Thank you.
 Hey, where's Jo? Is she...
 Good. Well, there's a back entrance she can use that avoids being seen.
 Great.
 Hmm?
 ...I'm gonna go wait for Jo.
 What? No. I'm not avoiding you. I'm trying to organize this whole circus here. I mean, did you see where they put the bar?
 No. Sorry, not wanting to lose your brother is pretty low on the selfish scale. Forcing someone to turn off their humanity on the other hand? That...
 Yeah. Do you hate me?
 Well, that makes two of us.
 I made a list... of uhm, all the things that I've done since I fell for you. It started last summer when you moved away. I started obsessing over where you were, wondering why you weren't returning my calls. I told you I hated you when I felt ignored, missing my mom's final moments because I was kissing you. and then she died...
  And all that I needed was for you to tell me that you felt something for me, and you didn't. And it affected me so deeply that I did the worst possible thing a vampire can do  I turned off my humanity. And when I thought I couldn't do anything else, I got you to turn off yours.
 Yeah, but, that's the point, Stefan. The old Caroline wouldn't have forgiven me. She would've smacked me and said "What the hell are you doing?" And I hate the way that this has made me feel.
 I know... but where I'm at right now in my life, with the guilt and the grief, control is all I have. And I don't think that I can give that up.
 Where the hell are you? Bonnie and Matt are already M.I.A, and now you and Damon? What is wrong with you? This is a wedding. This is supposed to be Jo's magical night, and you are ruining it. We're starting without you.
 This is not funny!
 We're not waiting anymore. Tell them to cue the music.
 Well, I hope it was worth it.
 Ick, gross! Not the time, okay? Have you seen Bonnie or Matt?
 Ohh, just go, go. Go, go, go.
 Oh, my God.
 She's human, what if she doesn't -
 Where are we going? Elena!
 There's a bigger problem?!
 Where's Damon?
 This whole thing with Elena... If they can't break the spell, are you gonna be okay?
 Of course not. But when she wakes up, she'll still be my best friend  after Bonnie's lived a long and happy life. Heh. But you? You were soulmates, and I want to make sure that you're okay.
 No, Stefan, I  I can't do this right now. I'm sorry
 It's easy, Bon. We just take her hand... close your eyes... and let her into your thoughts.
 Come on! Hurry up and get in here. I'm the one who gets to see her again. I mean, you should get the better goodbye.
 I will, I promise.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Stefan! What are you doing here?
 Do you think it's your mom?
 So... how's Damon?
 
 You made what a thing?
 No. It's not weird, Stefan...
 
 ...Obviously... you know... scrambling to fill the awkward silence.
 Okay, you made it a thing. Congratulations.
 
 Thank you.
 
 There's five Heretics  two guys, three girls. And, your mom isn't home.
 He's not there either. So, if we're going to do this, now is our window.
 Show me how this works.
 Mmhmm.
 Sixty seconds. Got it.
 I have to do this. They lived in your house for a hundred years. They've seen your picture. They'll recognize you immediately.
 Is there any version of this plan where you're not worried about me?
 
 
 Oh. Oh, no! Don't worry, I'm not selling anything. I'm your neighbor from down the block!
 Wow! Great place. Love what you've done with the floors. Is this the original hardwood?
 
 I'm just gonna put this right over here. Then...
 
 Clumsy.
 So, where are you guys from?
 
 Here! Take my jacket.
 See you!
 It looks amazing on you!
 
 
 
 I thought we blew them up! How did they survive that?
 
 God, what are you looking at?
 Come here.
 
 It's just, there's history here, you know? This town, and this house, these people... and I just don't see a world where Mystic Falls survives a war between us and them. And if Lily thinks she can control five Heretics, she's insane.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Yeah!
 Well, then where should I clump you? One day, you're helping Lily, the next you're here being nice. Just pick a side, Enzo. Us or them.
 That's because she doesn't trust you. And honestly? Neither do I.
 Are we making a huge mistake handing over our hometown to a bunch of supernatural terrorists?
 
 She would protect human life at any cost.
 
 Hey, Stefan?
 I'm happy. You make me happy.
 Uh... uh, my best friend's gone, my mom's dead... Uh, the whole town is destroyed... But, when I'm with you, I'm happy. And yeah, you're right. I just need to...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Okay, people. We go live in thirty, so I need that media package done fifteen minutes ago. Where are my graphics and b-roll?
 Jamie, we're good on music, right?
 Yeah?
 What? He knows that I'm working.
 But, your paycheck comes from me, and you know how much I hate surprises. Spill.
 
 
 Um, I will handle this later. Thanks, Tony.
 What the hell is wrong with you?
 Strange. You don't look like Lily.
 Well fun tip, friends don't really like being tied up with vervain ropes!
 Enzo, please! This hurts really, really bad.
 
 Ughhh, what did you do to me?
 Oh, it hurts.
 
 
 Look, my best friend used to live here. She had good style, and I'm sure that a couple of her dresses are in a closet somewhere.
 It's great, actually. Super vivid. It'll totally make your eyes pop.
 AHHHH!
 
 
 I couldn't help it! Ugh, that dress...
 
 
 
 
 You mean before or after the gallon of vervain they injected me with?
 
 Ugh...
 
 Valerie's spell...
 One of the Heretics was torturing me. The other one said that she would help. I just thought it would only burn them...
 
 I dunno. I feel like every molecule in my body is being pulled 
 STEFAN! Stef 
 What is it?
 
 And we're out!
 Great show, everyone! I will catch you at the Grapevine in a bit. I got first round!
 Okay, so let's call my fiancé back and talk about this Mystic Falls business. And don't worry, I'm not gonna tell him that you told me.
 Well, if he calls back, tell him that I'm not here, and I never want to hear the name Stefan Salvatore ever again. Got it?
 
 Tony? Tony! Tony!
 
 I hate you both.
 Hello?
 
 You must have dropped it when you got threshold-vacuumed out of here yesterday.
 Well, I'm spelled into your room by a menagerie of mean girls, but other than that...
 I'll be fine. Just keep Damon from killing any more Heretics.
 Who's Valerie Tulle? You wrote about her in your journal from 1863. She must have found a copy in the prison world.
 Yeah. Dirty-blonde hair, blue eyes? She's one of my new psycho housemates...
 
 Ohhh....
 
 
 And that's when you compelled him to write all those nice things about you in his journal. Spoiler! I've heard this story before, when a sweet, little orphan girl named Katherine Pierce waltzed into his life.
 And then...?
 I know why you put that burning spell on me. It's not so Mary Louise and Nora couldn't touch me. It's so Stefan wouldn't. Be more obvious.
 ...Of course.
 
 
 
 
 
 Then you know that love is different than any other kind of love.
 Stefan wrote about you all the time. You can read for yourself.
 Here.
 He loved you. He missed you.
 What, is this one of those mean-girl tricks?
 I don't know what made your heart grow four sizes today... but thanks.
 I didn't. Lily let me go.
 
 I was young and human when you and I met, and I remember the exact moment when I met you.
 And do you remember the first time that you ever saw me?
 I'm sorry. That was totally unfair. Just... please forget I asked. I mean, you were even sitting next to Elena, so of course you only had eyes for her...
 
 You don't wonder what would have happened if Valerie would have shown up to meet you?
 I know...
 Ahem.
 Well, I would lose more sleep if you just snuck out without saying hi!
 Mmm... I missed this.
 No! I just can't touch vampires. Valerie basically turned my skin into vervain.
 Stop! We have so much to catch up on. Let's just go shopping for Halloween costumes and we can worry about magic later.
 Wow! Okay... You don't even think it'll work?
 
 Hi.
 Oh, and he keeps getting better!
 
 I take it your charm didn't work on getting Valerie to undo the spell?
 
 
 Yeah, but that is quite an assumption, considering that she's the reason why I literally can't touch you.
 
 The dance?
 
 Yeah, they'll never fall for it... Unless they think it's their idea?
 Oh, nothing. It's just some silly "Heaven and Hell" ball. Stefan invited me, but I don't know. These days, Halloween just seems like an excuse to get drunk and show skin...
 Sorry. No Heretics allowed. Halloween's only for people who dress up as psychopaths!
 
 Oh, okay! Okay, good luck with that.
 Nothing! No, you two will fit in just fine. Seriously, you guys have nothing to feel self-conscious about.
 What do you want?
 I see you found a dress... from my closet.
 
 ...Unlike the hips of that dress.
 Look, I gave you an outfit. Now, it's your turn. Siphon off this annoying anti-vampire spell.
 What do you care about some silly spell? You don't even like Valerie.
 
 I didn't forget to invite you. I just felt like a Halloween party wasn't great first-date material.
 
 Oh, no. They're just wrapped up in their own drama. See, Nora wants some breathing room, but Mary Louise is scared if she gives it to her, then Nora's gonna leave her.
 Well, it's obvious!
 ...Or not.
 
 
 
 
 God! You know what? I'm just too sober to be talking about this.
 Grab my arm and siphon, or keep burning.
 Well, that was a lot more satisfying than I thought it would be.
 No! Wait, wait, wait. This can't happen yet!
 No! I need you to know that I am not some insecure, jealous girlfriend, okay?
 It's just when I get something that I've wanted for a really long time, sometimes I do this thing 
 Yeah, but sometimes, I say things that I don't really need to say, but I'm just scared that I'm the only one thinking them.
 No...
 No! I'm so happy just lying here and doing nothing. Just... listening to you... breathe.
 Uh, did you say kick, or did you say kiss?
 Mmm...
 Are you kidding me?
 Actually, I hate sugar in my coffee.
 Valerie?
 Oh, Stefan and Valerie are old flames from way back, and they haven't had a face-to-face since she came tumbling out of that prison world.
 You know what? I think this would be the perfect opportunity for you two to catch up! Unless there's a reason it would be uncomfortable for you...
 Great! Have fun.
 
 Well, don't look at me for advice. I just sent my boyfriend to spend the day with his first love.
 
 
 So, are you going out to meet a guy?
 
 Like a date?
 Wait, is this because you're feeling guilty for spending the day with your ex?
 Well, I'd love that. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit guilty for pushing you into a car with your brother and your ex, whom you clearly want nothing to do with.
 Why? What, did she make a move on you?
 
 
 
 Hey, not to be a pessimist, but how late do you think you're actually gonna be? Should I move the reservation to nine o'clock, or...?
 ...Or tommorrow, or next week?
 It's okay!
 
 Is... Is there anything else monumental I should know about?
 
 
 
 
 Who's Jacob?
 Jacob. You were yelling his name.
 Oh, probably because you're sleeping on the couch, silly. What are you doing down here?
 Valerie, I didn't know that you were staying here.
 Yeah. You do that.
 Okay.
 Explain.
 
 
 So what you're saying is, Valerie needs to disappear  new name, new job, a country in a separate hemisphere?
 Well, you just said that she's in danger. I mean, if I need to drive her to the airport myself, I will do that.
 
 Seattle looks nice. Hey, they've got the Space Needle! Great coffee, Mount St. Helens...
 
 Um, I mean, there's always Indonesia...
 Oh, you could rent a hut on the beach and drink out of coconuts!
 Lets put a pin in locations for a moment and talk names because Valerie Tulle is way too traceable.
 I'm thinking... Matilda. Oh, you could totally pull off Matilda!
 Matilda Pettigrew from Liverpool, England.
 What, do you want to write it down?
 What mess?
 Okay, I'm sorry  what didn't he tell me?
 Oh, here.
 Take my blood.
 Drink. It'll heal you.
 ...Or not.
 
 
 
 
 What is that?
 
 
 Ric, tell me that this isn't crazy.
 Because I don't want you to get your hopes up for something that is insane.
 
 Guys, stop! The spell isn't working, okay? The blood's just off the map now.
 See? I warned you not to get your hopes up.
 Oh, my God!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 And how many lines if you've been mystically knocked up by a coven of dead witches?
 This is crazy! I mean, you're an occult studies professor. Have you ever come across anything about a pregnant vampire?
 But how would it even be possible? I'm technically dead.
 
 Well, I guess she was wrong, or playing some twisted game. Either way, I trust that a lot more than I trust her.
 And I'm really sorry. I know how much you wanted this.
 Hey, Matt... Now's not really a good time.
 
 I don't know. Were you able to clear them out?
 
 
 What's with all the IVs?
 They're using them as human blood banks.
 I guess we know what the Heretics are having for Thanksgiving dinner.
 Yeah, I'm fine.
 I... I think I had an expired blood bag last night or something. You know, and then the talk of the food and the iron and the slaughtered cattle...
 
 Maybe someone can siphon it away.
 
 Nothing.
 
 I am not pregnant! Okay? Valerie over here convinced poor Alaric that the Gemini Coven dumped his twin babies into my...
 You know what? Never mind. Because it's not true.
 Yeah, and thanks to you, Alaric is probably still at home waiting for that second blue line to show up. So, you know what? Maybe now would be an appropriate time to call him and explain how you could get something so important so incredibly wrong.
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Maybe it was just a momentary lapse of... magical ju-ju. Look... Can you just please help us and take away these people's compulsion?
 You took a wrong turn and ended up in Mystic Falls. Leave and forget everything that you saw here.
 What?
 There is nothing to talk about.
 
 Unh! Ugh. Unh!
 
 Ugh! Isn't it possible that "Kill the psycho" and "Save the babies" just sound similar in Witch-Latin? Not to mention that you've been out of their loop for, like, one hundred years...
 
 I'm willing to believe you, okay?
 I need you to be 100 percent honest with me, please. How do you know so much about this spell?
 But why would you having a baby make Lily want to come home to Mystic Falls?
 Oh. That's the big secret that you have with Stefan.
 The baby was his?
 Valerie, the test was negative.
 Why? What's wrong?
 And you're absolutely sure?
 I'm so sorry.
 
 
 What are you doing?
 
 
 
 Hey.
 That's weird. Where did they go?
 Actually, I can't. I'm... 
 
 Oh, you know... totally supportive and just wanted to make sure that I was okay. At least, that's how I'm hoping it goes when I tell him today.
 
 I was, but I'm here now. Surprise! Heh.
 Coming where?
 Great. You're here, too. That's... perfect. Um...
 I'm... um....
 
 I know, it's insane. Magical baby transplants? I... I didn't believe it, either. But then I ate nine ice cream sundaes from noon to three, and none of my clothes fit, and then there was that whole part with the doctor and the ultrasound, so... Right. Yeah.
 You can say something...
 
 
 
 Okay...
 Well, you're either really drunk, or calling to tell me that you found a new girlfriend.
 
 Well, I guess there's no right thing to say when you find out your girlfriend is magically pregnant with another man's babies. Look, I know that this is happening to both of us. And you stood by me through... everything I went through with my mom, so I totally get it if you want to run for the hills.
 I guess there is a right thing to say after all...
 Are you sure? 'Cause it could get really weird.
 
 Last year, we filled ten crates. This year, I am aiming for twenty.
 Wait 'til you see me. I popped this week. I have a pot belly.
 To do what? Come to boring birthing classes? You're chasing after an immortal jerk who basically killed your mother. That's much more important. I can handle this...
 Yes. Here. How are you?
   And that's my cue. I'll call you later.
 Okay. One, that was marshmallow fluff, and, two, I'm feeding for three now, so I get cravings.
 Because he doesn't need to worry about the specifics of my magical pregnancy with Alaric's babies.
 Now I am!
 You sure you can handle this on your own?
 That was the least graphic one I could find. Study up.
 C.O.A.T. Note the color, odor, amount, and time, keep your birth plan on hand, and call your care provider.
 Well, yeah. I hope everyone did. It's a baby. I mean, each and every one of us are bringing a life into the world. That is a huge responsibility.
 Don't give me that look.
 That is a "Your hormones are making you crazy because you are pregnant"- look, which I will have you know is really just a man's attempt to minimize the gift that our bodies bring into this world.
 It's from A Feminist Guide to Pregnancy, Chapter 4, page 43.
 Yeah. It's just my vamp-hearing is working a little too well lately.
 No. It's okay. They're just having a difficult time with the subtle realities of the 21st century, where families come in all shapes and sizes.
 I think I should explain it to them...
 ...That I have a boyfriend, and while he may not be the father...
 It's just the... hormones.
 Ohhh, I was two seconds away from tearing their heads off!
 Oh, I've needed this all day!
 Do you think this is okay for the babies?
 I'm serious! What if blood is like alcohol? What if it's bad for them?
 
 
 I said, stop!!
 I... have to go.
 Hi, Mom. I just realized that this is going to be my first Christmas without you. That sucks. I still got you something. Two somethings actually. I will spare you the details of how, because honestly? I am sick of talking about it. But it's happening. I'm pregnant. I used to picture us having this conversation. It looked different, obviously. I was a human carrying my own children, and you... were... you were alive. I know they're not mine... But they're still my responsibility, you know? And I want to... I have to do this right. And I have no idea what I'm doing. And all I want to do is just sit on our kitchen counter while you burn our dinner and ask you a million questions.
 God, I miss you.
 Oh my God.
 She was your mom, Stefan. And if you think it's easy to let something like that go, take it from a girl who just got back from her mom's grave, it's... it's not. Let's figure out a way to save your brother.
 Oh, she's not answering. We need to call Valerie.
 Stefan?
 Yes, he will.
 Hey. He can survive this.
 Stefan!
 Matt, if Julian scorches Stefan's body, we can't get him back!
 Bonnie, no way! You literally just dragged Damon out of hell. I can't even believe you're standing right now.
 I'm 28 weeks pregnant.
 
 
 
 Because logic prevailed.
 Nothing.
 Look.... Uh, I don't know what you've just been through, or what it's like in that thing. But the longer that you are trapped, the more your humanity gets stripped away.
 
 
 You go. I'll take care of her.
 Hey, hey. It's okay. We're all just a little bit stressed right now. Let's take a deep breath, and we can start again when Bonnie's ready.
 
 Damon, don't 
 
 Super fancy. Even my purse has a chair.
 Absolutely. So, what wine are you feeling like?
 Well, I'm drinking water...
 Are you sure that you're up for this? I know it's the first time you've really been out since you woke up.
 Okay, good. Because Bonnie thinks she's close to pulling Damon out. She said that she felt especially strong today.
 And with any luck, we'll be celebrating something else soon.
 Stefan, stop. What are you doing?
 Are you really worried about Damon or is this just a convenient excuse to get out of the baby-food-tasting game?
 Honestly, I don't blame you. But Alaric needs this. You know, he doesn't have the necessary accouterments of a single father-to-be.
 Thank you. Hey, be safe today, okay? I finally got you back to reality. I want to keep you in one piece.
 This is a nightmare.
 
  Their only parent. A man who's hardly inspiring any confidence...
 Huh!
 
 Ha ha. There's nothing funnier than newborns and C4!
 
 Well, it's not about debt...
 As long as you understand... once these babies are born, I will not be on-call 24/7 to burp and bathe and feed and diaper...
 Well, it's not a problem. It's just that there's  Oof!
 Baby A just kicked.
 Mmhmm.
 
 There goes Baby B.
 Of course!
 Another nightmare?
 Damon was there? Then what?
 Clearly it's not. Whatever you experienced in that rock is still torturing you somehow.
 Who are you talking to?
 Stop! It's not real. It's not real!
 What are you doing?
 
 Excuse me for one second.
 Hey...
 I'm sorry, I was using it for the playlist. Are... Are you okay?
 
 Okay, okay. Stefan, just calm down. Focus. Okay? Wha... What is going on?
 
 
 Yeah, until you passed some kind of test. You never told me how you earned your freedom.
 
 You can't keep hiding like this, Stefan. You can't. Just please, let me help you.
 
 God. You can't go on like this.
 
 Do you really believe that?
 Um, I think that I should wash these onesies with the... hypoallergenic detergent first. Where are the keys to the laundry room?
 Yeah, I know. I know. We should also really get a head start on those car seats, because I read somewhere that first-time parents are just always messing those up. And did you happen to notice if the monitor came with little batteries? You don't have any around here. And the last thing that you need are just these screaming, crying babies in the middle of the night, and you can't even hear them...
 When were you gonna tell me that you're leaving?
 And what's wrong with the job that you have now?
 
 Vampires.
 Yeah. No, it was 
 Uh, no. I won't, because they're not mine. They're yours and Jo's. Anyway, I actually think it's really smart. You know, safety first. You and your babies should get as far away from here as you can.
 
 What are you doing here? I thought you were in Mystic Falls.
 
 Thank you.
 
 We? You're helping her?
 "Don't take it personally?" I have a family, Matt.
 
 
 Mmm, oh, my God! I love you!
 Do you want me to lie to you?
 Hi. I love you, too.
 Did you find him?
 Okay. Let me just chow down on this cheeseburger, and then I will help you track him down.
 Oh!
 Mmhmm. Yeah, just... Ow!
 Yeah, that wasn't very nice.
 Ahh!
 Mmhmm. I think I should just, um... I'm gonna stand up.
 For a second.
 Hey.
 Is my hand desiccating?!
 Yeah, duh! That's why we called you. Can't you just be witchy and fix it?
 
 What is it?
 
 Thank you.
 No, really. You know, we're not meant to like each other, you and I, which makes what you're doing all that much nicer. So, thank you.
 Uh, where's Stefan?
 Step out where?
 Step out where, Valerie?
 
 
 You want Stefan to defend your honor by killing Julian, so he can prove that he still cares about you!
 You have to go make sure Stefan's okay.
 I'm serious. I don't want you here with me, I want you there with him. I feel fine. So just go.
 Okay, so you're both awake. I get it. I'm bored, too. And I know that my magic blood tastes really good, but you're both gonna have to show just a little bit of self-control for a little bit longer, okay? Why don't we watch some TV? Hmm?
 Ow! Nngh!
 Ah! Stefan!
 AH! NNGH!
 What do you mean they don't want to come out?
 So what do we do?
 
 
 
 Oh, that is just perfectly reasonable  Putting my life and the lives of these babies into the hands of the people who tried to kill me!
 
 Are you... are you in my head right now?
 You're trying to distract me, aren't you? Everything okay? Is something going wrong with...
 
 When I'm with you, I'm happy.
 I totally get it if you want to run for the hills.
 What happened? Are they out? Are they okay?
 They're okay?
 Where's Stefan? What happened?
 
 I know.
 I just wish it didn't always have to be you.
 I love you, too.
 Oh, my God...
 
 
 
 Okay. Um, goodbye.
 
 To New Orleans... to visit Mommy's friend.
 All right, girls. You know what this is? It's a bar. And this is the last time you're gonna be in one of these until you are twenty-one...
 We're not staying. We just got here, and... then I realized, I didn't actually know where the person I'm looking for lived.
 Klaus Mikaelson?
 Look... I know that he comes here, okay? My name's Caroline Forbes. He'll know me.
 Gone? Gone where?
 Mmm, must be time for another check-up!
 
 What?? No, Ric, you still need a house, and a nanny, and the right school district...
 Is this about that psycho huntress? Because you can rest assured that she is very far away from here, pursuing my equally far from here boyfriend.
 Do you know how hard it is to travel with one newborn, let alone two? Two car seats, two feeding schedules, crying in surround-sound, not to mention the driving part.
 A nurse? Who? Frankie with the heart murmur? Or Jarica, the perpetual boyfriend-texter?
 
 Me! I'm the better idea.
 And I'm all healed up. That is the one and only perk of a vampire pregnancy. I can either sit here, alone, freaking out that my boyfriend is somewhere in this country trying to outrun a huntress that will stop at nothing to kill him, or I can be useful. It's up to you.
 What do you mean you don't know where Rayna is? She's wherever Stefan is.
 
 I'm here. What's the plan?
 
 What kind of diner runs out of ketchup?
 
 Okay, obviously I thought we'd have more time, so none of them are perfect, but I rated them out of 100, based on their age, GPA, and experience. You know, I figured you'd want someone intelligent but not overly ambitious...
 Ooh, why are you crying?
 You have a fresh diaper and a fully belly. And you have no idea how bad things can actually get.
 
 
 
 How am I talking to you right now? Where's Stefan?
 
 Two  I didn't call you. I called Stefan  yes, my boyfriend  who's currently running for his life while I sit here playing worst-case scenario. Except these babies  that aren't mind  won't stop crying, and now, this entire diner hates me. So, if you could refrain from gloating in the face of my misery, that would be very much appreciated.
 How do you know?
 
 No, they weren't. Luckily, these aren't mine.
 Oh, my God. She's finally sleeping.
 The girls are asleep. Furniture is en route, electricity will be on by tomorrow morning, and I am starving.
 Mmmm. Mmm, did you get a chance to look over the list of nannies?
 Tracy? Good, she was my first choice, too. And, I can compel her to lower her fee, if you want...
 
 I think I'll stay the night, if that's okay with you. Just to make sure that the electrician doesn't burn down the house tomorrow morning.
 Bottles are a go!
 Ugh.
 Oh, hey!
 I guess that's relative. I mean, I'm not on the run from a supernatural huntress. How are you?
 Oh. Yeah... Hey, that's totally okay. Honestly, there's a chance there was a little bit of contamination going on, so maybe that's not the worst thing.
 Stefan...
 
 
 
 So, out of curiosity, what are your feelings about Dallas?
 Well, it's not a terrible place to live. And, you know, the babies are here...
 I'm sorry, Stefan. I gotta run.
 I love you, too.
 
 
 
 
 Uh, hey. We just got back.
 Yeah, in a minute, honey.
 No. No, I got it.
 Happy you're home.
 I have a family, Matt!
 If you're looking for the crossbow bolts, I moved them in with the Halloween decorations. About the same time that I relocated your shotgun from the kitchen.
 Stake guns and vervain grenades are in the minivan. I called Leah over to watch the girls. They're going to make puppets and put on a show, gonna have the time of their lives.
 More for you than me.
 Okay, then you can stay here. Because I cannot read 'If You Give a Moose a Muffin' for the millionth time when I know my best friend is in trouble.
 Oh, nope. Yeah, I got it. No need to elaborate. Okay. Thanks. Whew, that is five minutes of crazy I am never getting back. Okay, so this is what I got from Rayna. The girl's name is Ashlynn. They guy's name is Wyatt. The rest of her visions are just body parts.
 No, the body parts are Ashlynn and Wyatt's. Uh, because they're having sex. Just lots and lots of intense, mind-blowing sex. Uh, Rayna was very descriptive (Caroline is un-appealed, having to continue to describe what Rayna has told her.)
 No, we're doing them a favor. Let 'em go out on a high note. Rip out their hearts before they inevitably do it to each other.
 I'm fine.
 I didn't have anything to say to him then. And I don't have anything to say about him now.
 Hi, um... we're getting married this weekend and we want to get his and her tattoos. Oh, I love that. "Ash." Is that short for Ashley?
 That's a beautiful name. Right, honey?
 What?
 What?
 But this is the longest I've ever been away from the girls. And all I want to do, I just want to get home and hold them.
 Yeah, you want to try it again? Maybe this time where you actually believe it?
 Tomorrow is the first rehearsal for the May Day pageant. I signed the girls up for Maypole duty. What are we supposed to tell the teachers? "Sorry, Miss Patty. We missed rehearsal because we were off slaughtering vampires."
 No, not before I know that Bonnie's gonna be okay. God only knows how many more ways Damon can screw this up by the end of the day.
 Yeah. Why else would I want to stay? No, I do not want to see Stefan, okay?
 Well, I'm not talking about Wyatt and Ashlynn, I am just talking about partnership and commitment and loyalty and honesty and all those things that Stefan just took away from me.
 I don't need closure.
 Look, I love our little family, Ric. It's unconventional. But I'm happy. So if this is the big conversation where we're honest about our life together, then I think we should talk about the fact that you're the one unfulfilled by it.
 I saw you today. In that place. We were being held captive, and all you could talk about was some stupid necklace. It's pretty clear that you've been just Indiana Jones-ing for something like that for a while now. Look, we've been trying so hard to have a normal life, but you know what, our life is not normal. Our kids are witch siphons, for God sakes. We are pretty deep in this. And if that's the way that it has to be, I want to be deep in it with you. Okay?
 
 I'll get you a glass of water.
 Oh, my God. Enzo, no!
 I think she's better off in here, don't you think? It's quieter and more peaceful... Did you grab those scented candles?
 No. No, you're not going to do this. 
 When she wakes up, we do not know what she's going to be or how she's going to feel. And if we chain her up, we've made that decision for her.
 Ric. The flight's in an hour, it's the last flight out tonight and Lizzie and Josie have been stuck with a sitter for two days now.
 While our three year old children are in a different time zone?
 I am the single best person for Bonnie to see when she wakes up... and you are the single best person for our girls to see when they wake up. Take the flight. I'll be home as soon as I can. I promise.
 We'll get through this.
 No, it should be me. I was her best friend before I was a vampire. I can show her the difference between the two.
 I'm not really in the mood for a backseat head-driver right now.
 You want to be helpful? Then do your thing and run away so I can focus on my friend.
 If you thought that was a hint, you were not paying attention.
 
 Well, you're half right, I'm in your head. Your body is safe in Damon's bedroom. This isn't real. And you just need to stay focused on me, Bonnie, your friend.
 It's your brain rewiring itself to hate vampires, to become the hunter. You have to resist.
 You just have to concentrate on who I am, you know, not what I am. I have kids now, Bonnie, and a family. You should see the girls, they are just getting so big. You have to fight the voices in your head. Open your eyes and just come and have dinner with us. We miss you so much.
 Uh, no, we haven't had that talk with them yet. Kind of waiting for the birds and the bees first.
 Bonnie, that's gross. This is your lizard brain talking. Fight it.
 No, that's not me. You know that's not me.
 About as bad as it could have. 
 How is that possible?
 Tell me this isn't real.
 I just need some air.
 Why? You don't understand how she marked me any more than I do.
 No, that is not an option. Enzo's gonna figure it out. He's gonna get through to her.
 So all of a sudden the past three years have just been a living hell for you? I saw the postmarks on your letters, Stefan. Paris, Marrakech, Bora Bora. I'm shocked you even had time to write between escaping certain death and sipping mai tais. Meanwhile, I was so desperate, I called Klaus for help, who's nowhere to be found, by the way.
 No, I do not want an explanation. All I want is for you to respect my choice to not run away.
 Did you seriously just vervain me?
 Is this a hostage situation?
 
 "We"? There's no such thing as "we," Stefan... There hasn't been for a very long time.
 Oh, how ironic, considering that the only reason I'm even here is that you decided to go all caveman and kidnapped me against my will. This is not you. You usually respect people's choices.
 You gave Elena that choice.
 Well, maybe one day you'll wake up and realize that I deserve the same respect that she did, but I stopped waiting for that day a long time ago. Whatever I decide to do about Bonnie is a decision that I'm going to make by myself or with my family, but not you.
 And if I leave them behind, then I'm abandoning them, which is just as bad. Maybe even worse. 
 You're right. It's not safe. I'm not safe because of this stupid scar, and any chance that my girls might get caught up in this whole hunt.
 You think? I am in the exact same situation that you were in three years ago, and now that I finally understand how you felt, I'm even more furious with you, because I know what a huge decision you had to make, and you made it without me.
 And three hours ago.
 You hurt me. More than anyone else has ever hurt me. I loved you and you left me.
 I just don't think that I can do that. 
 It's okay. You're alive.
 Okay, we run. 
 
 Uh, that's what I need to talk to daddy about. I love you. You know that, right?
 How? 
 No, if anything ever happened to the girls, or you...
 You know you can't promise that. Just stop being so supportive, will you? Just yell at me and tell me this is all my fault, because it is. 
 It's safer that way. I'm so sorry, Ric.
 I know. I'll call you when I get a chance. 
 In 30 miles, take 95 north and we should be in Maine by tomorrow night.
 I have no idea, but I will figure it out when I have to.
 
 I don't know. Can you love someone and leave them behind right when you need each other the most? Just ask me whatever you want about directions and travel plans and anything related to Bonnie. Those decisions, I can make. Ric and me... just please don't ask me to make that choice right now.
 I don't know. Can you love someone and leave them behind, right when you need each other the most?
 But if you kill the Everlasting, Bonnie dies. And so do we, for that matter.
 By who? Someone that wants you dead?
 Yeah, the people who hate us.
 Are you forgetting about the other problem that's in there?
 No! Absolutely not.
 No, my kids are staying out of this, Damon.
 No, it's for us. So that we don't have to run anymore. And that is not a good enough excuse to involve my children in this mess.
 Wow. This sure is a lot of cookie talk for 8 00 in the morning.
 So you stress baked?
 I miss you, too, baby.
 They're three years old. They shouldn't be involved in this world. Not yet.
 Lizzie siphoned me the other day. The girls had their friend's birthday party, and Lizzie took Josie's goodie bag. I took it back from her and then she grabbed my arm. She didn't mean to. I just want them to have as normal a childhood as possible.
 Thank you. This doesn't let you off the hook, you know. For the leaving or the kidnapping.
 No.
 Nope. Not even a little bit.
 There is definitely not a thaw.
 Bonnie?
 Why? What happened?
 How'd you catch up to us?
 Okay. We won't stop, I promise.
 Stefan?
 Do you think they're okay?
 Any word from Damon?
 You're not coming with me?
 Hey!
 Bonnie almost got us, but I'm okay.
 Damon and Enzo can fix her.
 It involves Josie and Lizzie.
 but then I talked to Bonnie on the phone and... gah, she's scared, Ric. And she's in pain. But they're your kids and I can't make that decision for them.
 She's my best friend. I don't know what to do.
 Want to know something cool? You two are special because you two are the keys. Let's play a game. Everyone put one hand on the door.
 Yes, because I took something from you. Now...how would you feel if someone tried to take me away from you?
 Yeah, me, too. And if we don't get inside of here, that might happen. I might never be able to see you or hug you or... tuck you in at night.
 Keep going, girls.
 Good job you two! You did so good.
 It's all over.
 Away from whatever's gonna come out of there.
 Stefan...
 Oh, God, it's been too long.
 Oh, my God, thank God.
 Where's Damon?
 Yeah...I guess he did it.
 Good. I'll get my stuff and...
 Ric...
 A part of me just...loved the idea of a perfect, happy family. And I didn't want to let that go.
 He's Damon. He's like a cockroach. He always survives.
 I still had some things I wanted to say to you when this was over.
 He always is.
 I lied earlier. There was a thaw.
 No, we can't. Only someone from the Armory can.
 Dear Elena, we were so close. Stefan and I had finally worked through our problems. Bonnie and Enzo were on the verge of being happy, and Damon... Damon actually did the right thing. The selfless thing. We waited in that room for days. Stefan didn't sleep. Throwing everything, including himself, at that door, trying to get it open.After a week, Alaric managed to crack the security code. We were prepared for almost anything... except what we saw. It was empty.
 
 
 
 And then she cut their sandwiches into the shapes of little hearts and stars, with no crust!
 I'm just saying, if Ric had hired the old lady nanny, then my kids wouldn't be wasting perfectly good parts of the sandwich. Millions of people in this world go hungry every single day while our hot nanny is getting all sparkly with their food.
 
 What I mean is, he's susceptible to hot nanny charms! We need to look out for him, you know? He's in a delicate place.
 What's on deck for today?
 Great, I will follow up with the local affiliates. Maybe today will be better.
 Bye.
 Stefan, they found a body!
 All those people that we've been tracking, and now there's a body. That's good, right?
 Hey! Hi! Hi, girls...
 Hi.
 Oh, it's okay!
 Thank you.
 Yep. Enjoy your salad. Bye.
 She probably likes kale, too.
 You don't want to know.
 This is a work movie that Mommy's been waiting for. The sound was broken, so Pete had to fix it.
 All right, that is Aunt Bonnie's friend Enzo. This is a movie about him trying to learn about...
 ...A magical creature. And that is Princess Virginia St. John, who used to be locked in a tower, and she's the only one in the whole kingdom who knows the secrets of the creature we're looking for. But the princess escaped, and now no one can find her.
 Oh, yeah, sorry.
 Well, it's not boring. It's just... broken.
 It's just a lot of empty land. Farms.
 There was a news story about this area a couple months ago. Some locals cried miracle when a nearby creek ran red with blood. Turns out there's a slaughterhouse with a drainage issue nearby. They closed it down.
 Exactly three miles.
 Ugh, God.
 Hey, I'm walking out the door right now.
 I haven't, but I can try his office, hold on. Is everything okay?
 Yeah, check their closet. It's their go-to.
 Hey, Brody, it's Caroline. I'm looking for Ric, is he around?
 Okay, thanks, just... Can you have him call me when he gets out?
 Okay, bye.
 Yeah, Seline, he's okay. He's just geeking out on the job.
 
 Seline?
 Hi, babies. Don't move, okay? Stay here.
 Come on. Come on!
 
 Okay, so obviously, this is a little bit awkward, but after a good night's sleep, you should wake up none-the-wiser. The girls are in the car. After dinner, take them for ice cream. Be gone at least two hours. Got it?
 Yeah. Okay.
 Wake up!
 I said wake up.
 You have thirty seconds to explain why you came after my kids. And then 30 more seconds to answer a few questions about that stupid vault.
 Go.
 Yeah, well, joke's on us! Fifteen seconds.
 No, no, we are not playing this game.
 What is it?! What does it want with my children?!
 What?
 Oh, my God. That's your tongue.
 I tried to heal her, but she just kept bleeding out until she was dead. I couldn't even get any information out of her.
 
 You want to move back into town?
 Ric... I want us to be a family and a team, yes, but... we can't live together.
 That's crazy. This is my childhood home! Where am I supposed to go?
 Ric...
 Hey.
 Bad day?
 So, I've been thinking... You, alone in this big house... I wonder if maybe... you'd like someone else to fill it?
 That someone would be me, by the way.
 Living here. With you. I mean, uh, I'm not trying to rush us, but if there's a part of you that might want that...
 So, I've been thinking about living here. If there's part of you that might want that.
 Dear Elena. Hope this isn't too messy, because I'm doing the mom thing of grabbing any spare moment to write, evenin my parked car. It's my turn to be the bearer of not entirely bad tidings, because finally there's some good news too. Bonnie heard from Enzo... sort of. He left something for her to find. It wasn't exactly a love note, but it looks like he's on our side. And elsewhere, in actual romance... The Salvatore House is about to become my official residence. I absolutely love it. The water pressure needs some work, but Stefan seems to be very focused on home improvements. Either that or he just needs a way to get out his frustration about losing Damon's trail again. On a brighter note, there have been zero unwanted houseguests since last week's craziness. Lizzie and Josie are blissfully unaware that they were ever in any danger. I wish Ric and I could say the same. He was just as freaked out as I was, but he's distracting himself by researching our new enemy. Whatever real-life, supernatural thing is controlling our friends, Ric will find a way to fight it.
 Hey. Just checking in. I hope I didn't wake the girls this morning when I took the boxes out of the garage. Will you just please remind them that I'm spending the whole weekend with them?
 You're right. Okay. You're right.
 Seline almost died protecting our kids, so I'm okay with her choosing their cereal.
 I told her it's like a really dark version of Pinterest. Did you see the cranberry muffins in the breakroom? I got them at the girls' bake sale.
 Well, Bonnie, you need to eat something.
 Okay. I'll widen the search radius. Especially now that we know Enzo's leaving clues.
 Yeah, and both women died of neck wounds.
 All the information they have so far are the victims' names. There's Sarah Nelson McGowan.
 And the second victim is Sarah Jane Nelson.
 Debatable.
 Stefan made sure she got adopted by a loving family. And gave her a trust fund, kept her safe.
 But she and Enzo had a... frenemy thing for a while.
 Is this a bad time?
 No, we're at Sarah's apartment. I just stepped out to give Bonnie and Enzo some space.
 Barely. At first I thought he was gonna try to escape. But then he made himself stay and talk.
 Willpower, I guess. He's fighting some kind of mind control. I mean, he won't even look at Bonnie.
 Lizzie, only people who don't hit their sisters get to go to the carnival, okay? I love you. Now put Seline back on the phone, please.
 What are you doing?
 No! No!
 I don't know. We've both been out of the loop.
 At least we know he's safe.
 We needed you here.
 Yeah, but we had a plan.
 So is that what made you go rogue? The fact that Stefan and I are happy?
 Is that how you really feel?
 You're not alone, Bonnie. Huh. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I should have thought about what this was like for you. I've been a terrible friend. Look, I know that I've been distracted, but I am here for you always, no matter what else happens in my life. I am here for you whatever you need, even if it's just to rage at me and scream at me.
 Except I was so caught up in my own drama, I didn't even realize what this was doing to you. I swear to you, we are going to save Enzo together, and then, we are going to go back to our normal, crazy, mutually-awesome lives. Your happiness is a part of my happiness, always. I'm gonna fix this. For us.
 I took Bonnie home.
 Oh, you needed some alone time. Want to talk about it?
 Let me rephrase that. You need to talk about it. You can't carry this all by yourself.
 Stefan...
 No. I was just gonna say that... Damon's not gone.
 You can't give up hope.
 You're making this into a room for my kids?
 Of course it's okay. I just... never expected you to do this.
 Oh, God.
 Yeah? Mm-hmm. Oh! It's beautiful. Oh, the girls are going to love it!
 Oh. Wear it like what? Like a friendship ring, or...?
 Yeah, I think you do.
 Too many words. Just get to the point.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Damon's not gone.
 Bonnie, what the... (laughing)
 Bonnie, look, I love you, and this is amazing, but you don't have to put on a happy face for me right now.
 Okay, but I promise we are going to find Enzo and you two are gonna be happy and you're gonna get married on the top of the Eiffel Tower...
 Oh, my God. Yes! The June wedding!
 You snuck into my house and found my old wedding book?
 Bonnie, this is amazing. You're amazing. Thank you.
 I'm getting married!
 Let's talk silhouettes. Focus on A-lines and sheaths. I'm open to trumpets, but easy on the volume.
 Exactly.
 Thank you.
 Now, let's get to work finding you the perfect maid of honor dress.
 Good. Because I'm going to do everything within my bridal power to make sure you and Enzo live happily ever after. I've got killer aim... and no qualms about rigging the bouquet toss. You ready?
 Catch!
 Damon, what are you... Bonnie, run.
 None of it makes sense. But we're gonna need weapons, lots of them. The throne is empty.
 And when you find her?
 Do you think we can get away with not inviting Damon to the wedding? I mean, even if we do save him?
 Fine, fine. But he is not sitting at the head table. Where is all the ammo?
 I'm starting to consider a destination wedding. Try finding a Mystic Falls venue that hasn't been the site of a horrible atrocity.
 Yeah well, I made that in the sixth grade, so congratulations. You have the fashion sense of an 11-year-old.
 You know, whatever you're trying to do here, it's not going to work. You're not going to get what you want. Something you should know about Bonnie is that she is fiercely loyal and she would do anything for the people she loves.
 You're crazy.
 And this is how you choose to spend that gift. You just escaped over 200 years of captivity. Why aren't you on a beach in Saint-Tropez sirening Channing Tatum to give you foot massages?
 You okay?
 She's not dead.
 We'll make it in time.
 I can't let you do that.
 She doesn't mean that. She's just upset. I'm gonna go stay with Bonnie tonight. She needs me. This has all been a lot for her.
 I had to.
 I hate it, too.
 Hey. For future reference, just because I spend the night with Bonnie doesn't mean you can't sleep in your own bed.
 Glued to Enzo's side, despite all the awful things he's saying to her. It's gonna take another day or two of starving him before she can get started with his humanity switch.
 Be careful. You've seen what Sybil can do when she gets inside your head.
 Is there some sort of engaged person shorthand for "Good luck and... I'm with you in spirit"?
 It's not gonna bring him back.
 Yeah.I can't even remember our last conversation. We haven't talked in months. We've both been so busy. After everything we went through, I guess I just always assumed that he would be there.
 Maybe the best thing to do is just to mourn Tyler with your friends. We all owe him that.
 Damon, enough!
 Damon, just go! Nobody wants you here.
 It was awful. Like Damon's desperate for us all to hate him.
 Please tell me it's going better than it did yesterday.
 I had to face my biggest fear. That I wasn't worth loving anymore. And that my mom would be ashamed of me. I had to be reminded how much she loved me, and then I had to want to live up to that. Is that helpful?
 Keep me posted. And don't worry about not being here, we'll give Tyler a proper goodbye when this is all over.
 Soon. I hope.
 And, in the mean time, what, let him run wild and kill another one of our friends?
 I swear, if Seline wasn't so good with the girls, I would hate her. She's too perfect to be a real person. Who's that for?
 Why the carnival?
 Are you gonna need some help?
 Two vampires are better than one, it's basic math.
 It's the right thing. Okay? You know it is.
 You already lost him.
 Welcome back.
 He was so much more than a small-town kid and he lived so much more than a small-town life. I loved him. You know, we all did.
 I'm going to be your wife. Which means helping you and protecting you. Even saving you, if I have to.
 I remember the last time that we were at this carnival. I didn't know how I could possibly deal with an eternity of being a vampire. And you told me the only way to get through it is to tell yourself that you're strong enough. Every day. Stefan, you're strong enough. And if you ever doubt that, I'm gonna be here to remind you.
 You gonna be mad if I tell you I'm happy to have you back here?
 Story of our lives.
 So I'm guessing you have a photo or two. Uh, that's them playing with the puppy filter, first day of school, uh, crafting at a friend's birthday party... Oh, I love this. Seline sent it, from earlier today.
 Mm-hmm. The nanny. I know, Ric hired the hot nanny.
 Lizzie?
 Lizzie?
 Josie? Girls? Girls!
 Ric...
 The nanny.

 Josie?
 I have these. I don't know which ones you want to use.
 This is them. And, uh, this is Sybil, the woman who we believe is with Seline.
 It's a hunch. Sybil is Seline's sorta sister.
 Look, it doesn't matter. Are you gonna disseminate these photos or what?
 That's a question for Alaric.
 No. Stop. You're not coming.
 Ric and I can handle it from here. And if you really want to help, then just stay with Matt and work with the police.
 Damon is with them.
 Let me be perfectly clear, Stefan. If Damon gets in between me and my girls, I am going to kill him. So no, you cannot come with me.
 Just don't say anything. Just listen. Until this is all over, there is no us. There's only me and my kids and their father. They're all depending on me. I can't afford any distractions or compromises, especially when it comes to your brother.
 Let's go.
 Take the next right, the diner will be a mile ahead on your left.
 Then... I don't know, Ric. But Stefan will find them. Somehow.
 Turn there.
 What did they do to him?
 We'll find them, okay? We will. Nothing else matters. We will find them.
 Where are the girls? Matt? Nobody's here. Where are they? Where's Stefan?
 You have no right to cut me out of this. They are my kids.
 Let's go.
 I don't know where, I just need to do something.
 I know.
 I know!
 But all of.. I'm sorry, what?
 Take a breath, Ric. You can't blame this on me!
 OUR kids.
 Thank you. It's so good to see you. Caroline  I missed you too.
 They should be sleeping in their own beds.
 You were right. Genetically, they are not mine. But I gave birth to them, I raised them, I loved them... and when they went missing, I felt like I was dying. So don't you ever throw that in my face again.
 Yes, you do... because you were right about something else. Right now, wherever I go... darkness follows me. So you need to take them. Take them someplace safe... until this is all over. Take them away from me.
 That wasn't fair, what I did... cutting you off like that. We're partners  and we should be making decisions together. I love you, Stefan, so much. But I have a really bad feeling about what you had to do to get my daughters back, so if you could just tell me. Rip off the Band-Aid. I asked you to do whatever it took, so... what did it take?
 What does that mean?
 No. No, there has to be... a way out of this. You promised me a June wedding.
 No, I don't accept that. You... are going to be waiting at the end of that aisle for me and we are going to start our lives together that day.
 No. What? Why?
 Yes, you do. Take them someplace safe. Take them away from me.
 I thought we agreed to cancel.
 Well, it's not about my plans, it's about... us and your deal with Cade.
 Hi, girls!
 Oh! Merry Christmas!
 Oh! Let me help take your jackets off.
 What? Why? This is my last day with them for awhile.
 No.
 No, honey.
 They're asking for Seline?
 She kidnapped them.
 Well, I don't want them thinking that she's safe. I mean, who knows when she's just gonna show up. I, uh... I'll talk to them.
 But we're supposed to have Christmas together first. What is it? Did something else happen?
 You what?!
 Thank goodness. Don't come. It's Damon. He's here with that psycho American Idol reject. 
 To ruin Christmas, I don't know. But they promised to leave my kids alone and I don't want a war. I just hope that they leave soon.
 I can try to find out.
 She might. Let me call you back.
 Eggnog?
 I didn't have time to poison it.
 Thank you. She's right. 
 Let's hope so. Goody.
 It was supposed to be in June, but...
 Thrilling. So, what's your favorite part about Mystic Falls so far?
 It's hard to find those around here.
 That's hilarious. Hmm. I'll be right back. There's a McMansion neighborhood called the Pond Estates. It's somewhere outside of Grove Hill.
 It is insane around here. Sybil wants to be my bestie. Lizzie and Josie keep asking about Seline. And I'm pretty sure Stefan's just off hiding somewhere.
 Yeah, well, she's not here, and...
 I need another gift box.
 Stefan? Stefan! Stefan...
 What did you do?
 Nope. Not even a little bit.
 Matt! I thought you said that you weren't coming.
 Well, Damon's alive, as you can see. Bonnie and Enzo are late. And Stefan's dead! Merry Christmas. I've got gifts.
 Let's make sure we all get back to the spirit of Christmas. At the heart of it is forgiveness. So, Matt. Peter.
 And my mother taught me to always be prepared for anything.
 Now, this one... is for Damon. Even though we've had our moments, I know that there is a future you that is going to ask for my forgiveness one day. This is for that guy.
 These are the au gratin potatoes. Stefan made them. They're a Salvatore recipe.
 You are not going to kill Ric... or anybody else. We are just going to sit here and enjoy this nice dinner just like Stefan wanted.
 Matt. Please.
 It's all personal, Damon.
 Damon, drop this stupid game.
 Enough! Enough. This has gone way too far. You do not need to answer him.
 Hey. Oh, thank God!
 He's gone. Everybody's gone.
 Where are we going? What happened with Cade?
 You could have kissed me anywhere.
 I love you, too. Now stop stalling.
 Why would you agree to that?
 What are you going to do?
  I know. I know. (The girls are giggling on the floor as they open up presents.)
 What are you going to do?
 Dear Elena, Sorry it's been a while. Three weeks, to be exact. By now Bonnie's probably filled pages and pages about how amazing Paris is. And Ric promised he'd write to you from his self-imposed witness protection with our kids. That leaves me, catching up on work projects and trying not to think about the past. Which is ironic, considering where my boss sent me today. By the way, Mystic Falls High School looks exactly the same as when you last saw it. I'm sure you've noticed there's someone missing from this entry. Stefan is with Damon now. I don't know where he is, or what he's doing, but I know it isn't good. So I'm doing everything I can to think about other things instead. Like I said, there's always work.
 Yeah. I'm, like, an embedded journalist, only in history class.
 Yeah. The school's doing a big ramp-up for Founder's Day. They specifically requested me, for the alumni angle. But I was just calling to see what you were doing for lunch. You know? I could save you a seat in the cafeteria.
 I'm... fine. You know, this is only temporary. All of this is... temporary.
 "Something rude" like impolite, or "something rude" like really disgusting?
 You're on.
 Yeah. Me neither.
 Thanks. Talk to you later.
 Wow! Your teacher sure does have a lot on her plate.
 What are you doing here?
 No. I mean, why are you masquerading as a history teacher?
 Are you mind-controlling these kids?
 Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what you want?
 The news assignment came from you.
 Mystic Falls was founded in 1860 when a Lockwood, a Forbes, a Fell, a Gilbert and a Salvatore gathered to sign the township charter.
 Those are the Founding Families.
 Are you talking about the hundred witches who were burned at the stake here?
 How could you know that?
 I don't think so.
 If anyone dies here, your little "apple for the teacher" act gets blown.
 I always forget you're so much older than you look.
 Do I want to know why your last visit to this field was around the same time a hundred witches burned to death?
 Are you saying it's your fault the witches were burned at the stake?
 Why do I feel like you're about to break into song?
 Wait... What are they doing?
 The Founder's Day parade. They ring the charter bell every year.
 That's not ominous.
 Violet, stop. Violet! No, everybody stop!
 Let them go.
 What do you even want this bell for?
 Or everyone dies, is that it?
 Yeah, I know how fire works.
 How exactly am I supposed to find this bell anyway?
 Matt, when's the last time you saw your dad?
 I'm fine. I just need to get Sybil the antique bell that your dad threw off Wickery Bridge.
 When your dad lived in Mystic Falls, he took our charter bell to Wickery Bridge, and then threw it off the railing. And now Sybil wants it back. She says it's got sentimental value, or something.
 1992, according to the head-dive Sybil did on your dad.
 Why?
 Well, let's hope they didn't sell it on eBay.
 All those boxes you brought over to the house, they're still in the garage.
 I don't have a choice, Matt. These kids are gonna kill each other.
 Ugh! God, we get it. You really should have been a teacher.
 I didn't have the heart to, but you wouldn't understand that, would you?
 Hang on.
 "Hey, sissy. Looking for something? Seline." Now I know why she kept organizing my house.
 What do you mean?
 Yeah, you're lying. Stefan made sure my kids would be safe.
 By the time I marry Stefan, he will be the man that I have always loved. He's gotten through Ripper sprees before.
 They ring the charter bell every year.
 All those boxes you brought over to the house, they're still in the garage.
 Hang on. "Hey, Sissy. Looking for something? Seline."
 Ah! You're here! Ooh! How was Paris? How's Enzo? Tell me you ate all the cheese...
 What?
 Thank you.
 That is so beautiful.
 Mm.
 That's...
 That seems like one very specific symbol. Are you sure that's what it is? I mean, you don't want you to...
 Yeah, or ever, right? I mean, according to the Bonnie Bennett that I've always known.
 Apparently she and her sister are fighting.
 What do you want?
 Did you want a congrats in person? I mean, we're due at an event.
 Or peanut butter and garbage. (Bonnie snickers)
 I'm just having a hard time taking you seriously because of everything you've done.
 Well, I love a weapon of terrible power.
 Miss Mystic Falls. Those of us who haven't burnt every single bridge we've ever crossed have obligations.
 Tell me you still have the tuning fork.
 Bonnie and I are stuck at Miss Mystic Falls, but Seline just tried to call a truce with us to put together the bell.
 Me neither. But if she's still in town, it means she must've hidden the bell close by. Can you get a lead?
 Once the dance is underway, we can get out of here and find that striker. Hopefully Damon decides to answer his phone.
 What are you even doing here?
 It should look effortless, ladies. And don't forget to smile. But not because society says you have to, but because you're happy to be at such an illustrious town event. You guys look great. Keep it up, and we'll call your names in a few minutes.
 So this is the new you, huh? Just slumming it at a pageant for hormonal teenagers?
 And how would you know what that looks like? The year I won Miss Mystic Falls, you spent the day in the woods trying not to kill Amber Bradley.
 Finishing touches, ladies. This year, the judges really value efficiency, so keep it short and sweet and we can all... get out of here.
 Damon, why are you upstairs?
 If you haven't given her that bell striker yet, I need it. It's part of a weapon that can kill sirens.
 It was Elena's.
 What did that woman do to you?
 Damon, I gave you that necklace because it is as powerful and as magical as the love that you and Elena have for each other. Being here and feeling what you're feeling proves that a love that deep and real can win over anything.
 What are you talking about?
 The fact that you're telling me this proves you care. Somewhere deep down in that part of you where Elena is still buried. Find that place, Damon. Fight for her. Or spend the rest of eternity trying to figure out what happened to the best part of you. It's your choice.
 Allow me to introduce this year's Miss Mystic hopefuls. Violet Fell, escorted by Ryan Ashton.
 Miss Trudy Sulez...
 ... escorted by Garrett Tanner.
 And Miss Flora Martinez...
 Tell me you're not listening to him. He's not himself. Okay?
 You know, I already lost Stefan. I'm not losing you to Sybil's sabotage.
 You did this dance. With Elena.
 It meant something to you. And this event, this place, it only means something to you because of the feelings you attach to it. Your lizard brain is trying to remind you of the truth.
 Just... dance. And trust that Elena is right here dancing with you.
 There's another way, you know. We can fight Sybil.
 The striker is the final piece to the weapon. And if we use it, maybe we can break her influence over you.
 Damon just took Sybil inside. If he's giving her that striker...
 You two get everyone out of here safely. I'll take care of this and get the striker.
 Hey, everyone. Um, so sorry, but, uh, this year's pageant will have to be cut short due to a gas leak in the kitchen. So please exit quickly, and get home safely. Thank you all for coming.
 Um... it's a six-way tie. 
 Who told you, you have to stay?
 You let them go.
 Evil people and murderers. These girls are innocent, Stefan.
 No!
 What do you mean?
 You're turning them?
 Unlike you, I can control my bloodlust. Not all vampires are evil.
 Well, the judge did pick you.
  And now, so are you. Well, at least, you're becoming one. You have 24 hours to drink human blood, or... well... that's the end. There's a way to live with this. I know it sounds bad, but you're alive. You're still you.
 I'm... I'm not saying it's going to be easy, but...
 Okay. You want to know what I did after I became a vampire? I graduated. I went to college. I became a news anchor. There are downsides. Believe me. But the one very big positive is that life doesn't have to stop after you die.
 I can help you. Come here.
 I told you. We're in this together. If that means the blood's on my hands too, so be it. For the next year, we do what we have to do to get you out of your deal with Cade. But we do it my way. No more turning good people bad. We stick to murderers and drunk drivers.
 You and I had a deal, too. Remember? We were supposed to... spend our lives together. One day you're going to wake up and realize that... you don't even remember what happiness is. Not "fun"... but happiness. Until then, just stay away from me.
 You let them go.
 Evil people and murderers. These girls are innocent.
 No!
 One day you're going to realize that you don't even remember what happiness is. Until then, just stay away from me.
 
 Oh, you know, just motivating.
 Guilty as charged. Why are you breathing so heavy?
 What's on your mind?
 I'm the last person you should be asking for relationship advice.
 Are you really here right now?
 Wait, Damon's here too?
 I'm guessing Sybil happened. But the real question is  what did she do to his brain this time?
 Will you let me go back to bed if I tell you I can't?
 I don't know. I... It was just fire and pain.
 Wait, do you hear that?
 Well, looks like we have a rat in the cellar.
 Then why is he a zombie?
 What do you want?
 Well, this phone call's not gonna make it any better. I need the bell.
 Because I'm gonna give it to Sybil.
 I know, but Sybil basically fried Damon's brain, and now she's the only one who can fix him. We have to give her what she wants.
 I have no idea. All I know is that Damon is trapped in his own mind, and his mind is a volcano of pain and suffering.
 You don't mean that.
 What? Oh, my God. Matt, I'm so sorry.
 You're right. I'm worried, okay? I know how messed up everything is right now. And if you won't do it for them, please, do it for me.
 What?
 Well, how do we change his mind?
 Um, I'm not sure. Do we need one?
 Yeah, we know all about that, but where is he right now?
 Damn it.
 How are we supposed to know?
 You're the one that did this to him so un-impossible it. Fast!
 Stefan.
 I told you to stay away from me. What are you doing here?
 We are trying.
 Well, he's not at his favorite bar stool, drinking imaginary bourbon to wash his guilt away, so now what?
 At which point we do what? Just blindly forgive him for all the hideous things he's done to us over the years?
 Say that once more. With feeling.
 Vicki Donovan?!
 But on the bright side, Damon bit Vicki in that exact spot, you remember. Follow the clues.
 I mean, it's weird, right. If I built a world in my own mind, I would make it a happy place, unicorns required. But Damon killed Vicki so why would he want her hanging around?
 I don't think we're the only ones working this case.
 I forgot how pretty she was.
 No, she's not real, Bon.
 Hi, Mom.
 Oh.
 You're right. Damon Salvatore.
 I know, it's all a little confusing. Damon was, um, is in the Founders' Council and he's sorta your best friend. Or he became your best friend.
 Damon is a vampire. The one behind your so-called animal attack.
 Mom, really, it's fine. I need to find Damon just as bad as you do. So, I was thinking, maybe we could team up. Whaddya say?
 Aah!
 Bonnie, find Damon.
 Mom why are you doing this to me?
 No. I told you Damon is the one who's doing it, not me.
 Oh, Mom, please, no you know it. Just stop hurting me for one second and think.
 Damon Salvatore. Stefan's brother.
 I'm telling you the truth. And I'm not leaving here until I find Damon.
 No.
 No, you are.
 You got sick and you died, Mom. And you wanna know who was there for you the whole time? It was Damon.
 Believe me. I never thought I would see the day. Damon was a monster and he did terrible things to me and my friends and I used to hate him for that.
 Because he was the only person who truly understood how much it hurt to lose you. And as strange as it sounds, that made me forgive him for everything else.
 Mom, wait! Mom. Mom!
 Mom.
 What just happened?
 I have 100% confidence in Bonnie.
 She wants to give the cure to Enzo? She asked for my advice, we just got a little distracted.
 Are those her feelings or yours?
 Hey, you ok?
 Why?
 Bonnie! Bonnie!
 Actually I can. So before you try tearing me down again I am fully aware that Damon means more to you than I do.
 Because I love you, Stefan. The other you, the good you. But this quarter of a man I'm staring at isn't you, not even remotely. So, if Damon is the answer to getting your humanity back, not me, fine. I will do whatever it takes. Then we will love each other forever or we won't. We'll make our relationship work or we won't. But either way, I'm getting you back.
 I will do whatever it takes. I'm getting you back.
 Hey. You okay? You looked a little shaky up there.
 I feel like Mystic Falls just isn't as safe as it used to be.
 Elena, Bonnie and I made our own time capsule when we were 11 and buried it right under this tree. And I cannot believe it is still here.
 
 
 But I'm staying positive. I mean, look at Damon. Humanity on and he's a new person. Stefan will get his emotions back, too.
 Stefan's not him...
 Yeah, this looks great. Thank you.
 What?
 Damon...
 Hold on, back up. Where is Stefan now?
 Voice mail.
 How is this even possible? I thought Cade was supposed to live in some kind of psychic dimension.
 Does your plan B account for that?
 Well, where are you going?
 That's right, everyone! Happy hour, all day long.
 Oh, you know. Just Damon being told to kill a hundred people, or else kill me instead. Just... standard afternoon special.
 Cade. By the way, he's out in the world. Walking around, taking in the sights. Look, Damon's on it. He's got a plan. But in the meantime, I made you something. Just in case. 
 Than survive?
 All right, all you can eat, time capsule prices.
 No, but so far I'm encouraged by the continuing lack of hellfire.
 Which is why you should have a supernatural insurance plan. I'm just putting the alternative out there.
 And die. Not that that's the goal.
 Well, the lows are low, I'm not gonna lie. But... you feel stronger than you ever thought you could feel. Powerful. And everything's heightened. Emotions, appetites, joy...
 Some people don't regret it.
 What was wrong with plan B?
 I thought you said you weren't gonna try anything stupid.
 He's immortal.
 He cannot be killed. So... we just need to change the equation.
 There's one thing that can turn immortals mortal.
 What is the bigger risk... Making the devil mortal so that we can kill him, or letting him stay immortal, and just waiting for him to kill us? Look, all we need to do is capture Cade...
 We give him the cure, he becomes mortal. Then someone else will take his blood. That'll make him age 4,000 years and then shrivel into dust.
 This is our best chance to get Stefan back. Isn't that what you want?
 You won't have to take the cure right away. Enzo will take it from Cade, and years from now, you can take it from Enzo.
 Bonnie asked him. He said yes. They were going to tell you.
 It doesn't belong to you. It is in Elena's blood. She would want to save all of us, and you know it. Anyway, I've done the math. It can work.
 It's not about being sure. It's about using what we've got. Unless you have a plan D.
 Find any secret messages?
 Well, if anyone can figure it out, my money's on you. 
 Lime juice hides the taste. Huh.
 You are surprisingly low-key about the existence of the supernatural.
 Yeah, but how does one even pick that as a major?
 God, I'm... so sorry.
 Um, have any advice on how to deal with the devil?
 Nobody else has to die.
 Why do you want me dead? Have I offended you somehow?
 Stefan would never hurt Elena.
 Wait, I'm coming with you.
 Then why even answer my call?
 Wait, you're doing paperwork?
 What are you talking about?
 I just sent the last guy home... after compelling him to forget today's not-so-happy hour.
 You know what? I have had a crappy couple of days. I don't need you shoving your judgment in my face.
 It's exactly the same as it was back then. We just didn't know any better because we were kids, playing games and burying old photos. Adults hid the darkness from us, Matt. We're the adults now. And you're part of the darkness. That's not fair.
 Stefan, thank God. I talked to Damon, and I know what happened to Enzo.
 Just please come home.
 Well, I'm not letting you run. Okay? So just tell me where you are. I'm coming to get you.
 Stefan? Stefan! Stefan?
 That's because he's on his way to Rockland County Police Department. He's been arrested.
 In what world is that good?
 I've left so many messages. She just won't answer her phone... I don't get it.
 Thank you. Please notify all the other agents and officers this was all a terrible
 The deal's off.
 You're human, and you're of no use to him. He's giving you until midnight, and then he wants you dead. But don't worry. Damon’s on it.
 Thank you. And you're going to erase every mention of Stefan Salvatore's name from your system.
 I know. Let's go find her.
 Does any of this look familiar?
 Damon's gonna come through, okay? He will.
 Is that what you think of me? 
 She survived. There's still a chance.
 Stefan?
 Come on, you have to drink. Drink! 
 She's okay. I compelled her to wait by the road for the ambulance. They're on their way. Just hang with me. 
 No, you don't, okay?
 You saved that woman's life.
 You are not going to give up. You are going to keep fighting. You are going to live. You are going to stay alive so you can make all of this right. 
 Okay, I got antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and pain meds. I guess you wouldn't know
 I know. It's just when I think about what our lives are supposed to look like now, I just can't see it. Ten years from now... 20, 50... we're gonna be living entirely different lives, and we can't just... ignore that.
 But... it doesn't mean we have to just... throw all this away because it's not what we wanted or expected.
 I don't either.
 How did you..? These could have fallen on you. What have I been telling you? You need to be careful. And these dresses are not playclothes.
 Look I know you girls are excited about the wedding, and wearing these dresses and all of it but it might not be as soon as Mommy promised.
 Well, people who love each other don't always get married. It doesn't mean they don't love each other, it just doesn't always work out that way. Oh, honey, please don't be upset.
 Girls, please.
 This happened at school?
 When were you gonna tell me the girls were asked to leave their preschool?
 But you lied to me. You said that the magic and the siphoning were new.
 Stefan and I are having some issues. I don't know what's gonna happen so I didn't want to be surrounded by all my wedding stuff.
 Who're we gonna call? They're not triggered by some magical development or coven secret or anything you're gonna find in your books. It's probably just, uh, us.
 Think about what we've put them through. Splitting up, moving around, everything that happened with Seline. The way they came into this world, even. They're sensitive children.
 No, but we could do better. If we just start trying.
 Given what you've just dragged in, I think you should be the one explaining.
 Great. Another Salvatore brother freezing me out. Stefan told me that he needed to go on some spirit walk to God knows where, figure out if he wants to be with me.
 You felt that way about Elena. I need Stefan just as much as she needed you. And Lizzie and Josie need him too.
 It's been a long and exciting day and you girls should have no problems falling asleep.
 It's ok but no more of that. Okay, do you think you girls can cut that stuff out. Just try your best, okay.
 You killed your sister, Jo, you tried to kill her kids too so why would you be interested in helping?
 Wasn't the same thing happening to Jo?
 How do we fix them?
 Uh, yeah.
 So, the girls' magic is going haywire because we brought them to the Armory.
 Bonnie. What happened?
 
 Oh, my God. No.
 There he is. Matt!
 Have you tried the high school?
 Okay, I'll meet you there.
 I grabbed the baby books. Do we need anything else?
 Listen, I need you to go ahead. I'm gonna stay here and help Stefan.
 Katherine has taken Elena's body, so I'm going to help them find it.
 You know Damon won't leave this town without her.
 It's Elena, Ric, and they need me.
 They have you. Okay? Just Come on. Get them to the Armory, I'll meet you there. I promise. 
 I grabbed the baby books. Do we need anything else?
 Listen, I need you to go ahead. I'm gonna stay here and help Stefan.
 Katherine has taken Elena's body, so I'm going to help them find it.
 You know Damon won't leave this town without her.
 It's Elena, Ric, and they need me.
 They have you. Okay? Just... Come on, get them to the Armory, I'll meet you there. I promise.
 You won't have to. I'll get out of here safely. I promise.
 Kai spelled her in. She can't get out.
 What are we supposed to do? I can't leave Elena here.
 
 Do you think you'll convince him?
 I made a promise to Ric... that I wouldn't risk the girls growing up without a mother. So I can help you with Damon, but I can't -
 We're family now. Okay? You and me and the girls. It's just please, please, 
 No.
 Family first.
 I love you too. 
 
 But, I don't... Bonnie.
 Just don't do anything stupid, Bonnie Bennett.
 Tell me what's going on.
 Stop the car. I said stop!
 Stefan, please call me. Please. I need you to know that I understand. I love you. I will love you forever. I understand.
 Peace? I do. We'll see him again.
 Don't be so sure.
 He got my message.
 Opening the school was hard work. We needed lots of help. Fortunately we knew plenty of people with experience. Here you go.
